Boy was I naive or what!? Now seeing it again after all these years I could see that I was not ready back then to handle a movie of this complexity and strange coherent means of story telling. But now I fully respect and love this movie for what it is and for what it always will be, mindbogglingly, mind blowing, out of this world fun.When the Matrix was released in 1999 this was the film to go see people were busting out of the theater's and telling anyone they can to go see this movie. It was the It movie of the year and it gained the title justly. This film mapped out new territory in action and ushered in a whole new generation of action & Sci-Fi thrillers and video games as well(Max Payne comes to mind) it is one of the biggest and most beloved film of the 90's and has one of the biggest fan base out there.This movie unique and I mean unique story and style has such and impact on you when you first see it you'll want to see it the minute it's over and some more after that and after that and you'll want to see it a million times it's just that good. The Matrix put's a Gothic and dark spin on the dystopia and apocalyptic themes that have become very common in Sci-Fi films, this film does it one better it takes those overly used themes and creates a completely original and unique world around which everything we Believe is a lie. It has a great monolithic tone to it that makes it a masterpiece by any standards and it creates a great aftershock in which few films can actually do these days. It purposes that machines while enslave humanity and use us as a battery source to power there vasts armies of machines around the world. But that's what makes it so great to watch it gives you a sense of hope and a sense of justice that you just feel all the way to your bones.This movie has given the fellow movie goer what they've always wanted and always searched for in a film, great action, a smart story and plot, acting you can live with and put them all together and what do you got? The Matrix! This movie will stick with long after it's over and even after tour old you'll still remember one movie that rocked your world like none other. All in all this film delivers great any day entertainment that is like Laurence Fishburn said,  Unfortunately no one can be told what the Matrix is you have to see it for yourself. And trust me once you do you won't ever look at Sci-Fi or other movies the same way again. This movie delivers.

Poor Edward went through so much, then was able to carve out some happiness with people and then had it taken away again. The ending is just enough to break your heart. Then again, what can one expect from Tim Burton? The movie has a very Gothic look to it that would also be seen in Batman Returns though I would argue he got a bit to dark and Gothic in that one.

Video game movies are a tough sell anyway, and in this one you had to sell the Mario Brothers and it just did not work out all that well. They probably did the best they could, but the end product was still just painful to look at. The plot had Luigi actually playing a more prominent role than Mario as the princess was more into him. Bob Hoskins is good in some roles, but really can not pull off the lead role, Dennis Hopper does not seem to actually read the scripts he is given when he chooses a role, and backing out of this movie was one of the smartest things Danny DeVito could have done after winning the raspberry for his role as the Penquin in Batman Returns.

Usually the movie based on a book should at least attempt to preserve that, but it was mathematical, not unlike the computer models so excellently done in the movie--so it's debatable there were other motivations to further dumb down the content. Computer graphics are OK, just don't give people any ideas; and that's roughly the paranoid police state's continuing theme from movie to movie. So paranoid in fact, former head of creativity for Walt Disney Company Eric Hazeltine headed up a Discover magazine round table with American mathematics leaders to discuss no longer teaching long division in the public schools (9\/'02). The point is, he was also a figure in the NSA meddling by some 'association', thus we have a connected set of reciprocating facts surrounding what Sen. J. W. Fullbright called, The Pentagon Propaganda Machine, largely channeled through the movies. So it's all about this idea of using cybernetic controls to pose as an alien threat, or the ultimate hack into human consciousness or tool for propagating torture and psychological conditioning on the population called Quantum Information and Communications (many titles are in the university library). And of course it has to have exclusive control over Artificial Intelligence, rumored to have begun development under DARPA way back in the 50s. Noam Chomsky tries not to allude to it very much, unsuccessfully, in his book Language and Problems of Knowledge. The brain is sort of a language processor, so better look out for that character. Thus, the public is condescended to in this film quite miserably; I was expecting less overacting and more science. I guess any theater company's rendition of 'Trouble in Tahiti' is going to disappoint some of the audience by a wide margin, or fail to capture many important elements of the story. Certainly the effort to push Shakespearian English on the modern drama goes without question as the worst form of retro. So when we go to the movies, expectations should consider anything possible. I guess it wasn't so bad...except for the effort at incorporating docudrama...with news coverage and Clinton's Mars Rock tape. That got off subject by confusing current events with a science fiction story. Of course the San Diego cult's execution has nothing whatsoever to do with any of this, or that viewing technology misrepresented in Quantum Gravity by Lee Smolin, or that other industry promo by Spielberg in 'Minority Report'. What can be done? Any book is going to drive the movie projector and production of the imagination about 10 times better than a movie ever will or ever could. This is why motion picture propaganda is so easily filleted. (Take for instance the continent hopping, double murder insurance scam in 'Flight Plan'--and other unsophisticated macho pieces) Movies are a kind of opiate for the masses, they're literally feeding off their sponsor's desperate desires to condescend and intimidate, pride in playing everyone for a fool, and more importantly a serious propaganda problem of a warfare level of escalation, such as the movie 'The Forgotten' which tries to blame missing persons (like the prior movie) and modern disasters on aliens. Is extraterrestrial intelligence an important question for concern? It certainly is so far as the evasion of crime under such a ridiculous proxy to condition public passivity. Does it lend itself to any practical context with the down to earth? I doubt it. And the reason is actually more curiously redirected to the question...it is comprising more offshoot entertainment themes that posit a different universe or a different consciousness than was expected...movies like 'The Matrix', 'CUBE', 'THX', 'Planet of the Apes' or allegorical time travel settings. So who knows? It doesn't interest as much as it used to, the bigger questions of course being the unceasing war on many levels between the various cultures of human beings, and not short of arriving in the American daily life. Science fiction has always been a social prospectus or blueprint for great dreams of beyond even urban planning, as have terrorist political movements always envisioned since earlier in the 20th Century. Then here we are right where it's thinking nothing of clearing the way, i.e. building demolitions and war spawned genocides. Let's take a look at one thing that was brought up in the earlier review, that being the oddity of the crop circles and elaborate glyphs. That certainly hints at a sign extraterrestrial presence maybe. Because you know, science and technology are not a static thing. In the 1950s diplomacy attempted to shake the earth in the South Pacific with hundred of enormous hydrogen bomb blasts, so called testing that was more a race of saber rattling...and of course its high aloft radioactive fallout disintegrated enough tri atomic oxygen to form the ozone hole...a fact that has to hide behind a courtesy screen in a book title like Ozone Diplomacy. The 'official science' doesn't add up, contrasting the Northern polar region's allegedly intact ozone layer where all the industrial CFCs were produced after all, and by the way, all the ozone from tailpipes of millions of automobiles at the same time.

Usually the movie based on a book should at least attempt to preserve that, but it was mathematical, not unlike the computer models so excellently done in the movie--so it's debatable there were other motivations to further dumb down the content. Computer graphics are OK, just don't give people any ideas; and that's roughly the paranoid police state's continuing theme from movie to movie. So paranoid in fact, former head of creativity for Walt Disney Company Eric Hazeltine headed up a Discover magazine round table with American mathematics leaders to discuss no longer teaching long division in the public schools (9\/'02). The point is, he was also a figure in the NSA meddling by some 'association', thus we have a connected set of reciprocating facts surrounding what Sen. J. W. Fullbright called, The Pentagon Propaganda Machine, largely channeled through the movies. So it's all about this idea of using cybernetic controls to pose as an alien threat, or the ultimate hack into human consciousness or tool for propagating torture and psychological conditioning on the population called Quantum Information and Communications (many titles are in the university library). And of course it has to have exclusive control over Artificial Intelligence, rumored to have begun development under DARPA way back in the 50s. Noam Chomsky tries not to allude to it very much, unsuccessfully, in his book Language and Problems of Knowledge. The brain is sort of a language processor, so better look out for that character. Thus, the public is condescended to in this film quite miserably; I was expecting less overacting and more science. I guess any theater company's rendition of 'Trouble in Tahiti' is going to disappoint some of the audience by a wide margin, or fail to capture many important elements of the story. Certainly the effort to push Shakespearian English on the modern drama goes without question as the worst form of retro. So when we go to the movies, expectations should consider anything possible. I guess it wasn't so bad...except for the effort at incorporating docudrama...with news coverage and Clinton's Mars Rock tape. That got off subject by confusing current events with a science fiction story. Of course the San Diego cult's execution has nothing whatsoever to do with any of this, or that viewing technology misrepresented in Quantum Gravity by Lee Smolin, or that other industry promo by Spielberg in 'Minority Report'. What can be done? Any book is going to drive the movie projector and production of the imagination about 10 times better than a movie ever will or ever could. This is why motion picture propaganda is so easily filleted. (Take for instance the continent hopping, double murder insurance scam in 'Flight Plan'--and other unsophisticated macho pieces) Movies are a kind of opiate for the masses, they're literally feeding off their sponsor's desperate desires to condescend and intimidate, pride in playing everyone for a fool, and more importantly a serious propaganda problem of a warfare level of escalation, such as the movie 'The Forgotten' which tries to blame missing persons (like the prior movie) and modern disasters on aliens. Is extraterrestrial intelligence an important question for concern? It certainly is so far as the evasion of crime under such a ridiculous proxy to condition public passivity. Does it lend itself to any practical context with the down to earth? I doubt it. And the reason is actually more curiously redirected to the question...it is comprising more offshoot entertainment themes that posit a different universe or a different consciousness than was expected...movies like 'The Matrix', 'CUBE', 'THX', 'Planet of the Apes' or allegorical time travel settings. So who knows? It doesn't interest as much as it used to, the bigger questions of course being the unceasing war on many levels between the various cultures of human beings, and not short of arriving in the American daily life. Science fiction has always been a social prospectus or blueprint for great dreams of beyond even urban planning, as have terrorist political movements always envisioned since earlier in the 20th Century. Then here we are right where it's thinking nothing of clearing the way, i.e. building demolitions and war spawned genocides. Let's take a look at one thing that was brought up in the earlier review, that being the oddity of the crop circles and elaborate glyphs. That certainly hints at a sign extraterrestrial presence maybe. Because you know, science and technology are not a static thing.

I saw a good bunch animated Disney flicks as a kid, from different eras, and I would say The Brave Little Toaster is by far the least Disney-like of them all! However, I guess it isn't really a Disney flick. It was released by Walt Disney Pictures, but was produced by Hyperion Pictures. Obviously, that explains a lot. Anyway, sometime within the past four years or so, I watched it for the first time probably since the 90's, and finally, once again last night. Like a number of films that were actually produced by Disney, this Hyperion Pictures production is a decent family adventure that has held up well for me in recent years.In a rural cottage, a group of living, anthropomorphic appliances reside Toaster, an electric blanket named Blanky, a lamp named Lampy, Radio, and a vacuum cleaner named Kirby. They used to see their master, a young boy named Rob, every summer when he came to the cottage with his family on vacation, but they haven't seen him in a while. They wonder if he will ever come back to this house in the woods, or if they've been abandoned. When they see a for sale sign put up in front of the house, the Toaster decides to lead the rest of the appliances on a journey to find their master. After getting the reluctant Kirby to agree to come along, and a bit of a struggle to find means of transportation, the five of them set off on a trek through the country to the city where Rob lives. Their journey does not turn out to be easy, however, as they experience conflict and life-threatening situations on the way! After watching this cartoon again after a long time, there are certain negative aspects I can point out. Some of the voice acting is a little weak, sometimes with Deanna Oliver as Toaster, with lines such as, It's the blanket, and especially the voice for Blanky (though I'm sure Timothy E. Day, whoever he was\/is and whatever happened to him, was just a little kid at the time, so I guess I shouldn't complain too much). I also didn't care much for the part where the cottage air conditioner loses his temper and blows up. However, there's definitely a lot I still like. Most of the voice acting is good, including the voice-overs from two Saturday Night Live stars, Jon Lovitz as Radio and the late Phil Hartman as Air Conditioner (an imitation of Jack Nicholson) and the Hanging Lamp in the shop (based on Peter Lorre). There are definitely funny parts as well, often involving the conflict between Lampy and Radio. The part with appliance shop owner Elmo St. Peters can also be funny (it's sad to know that Joe Ranft, the multi-talented man who provided this character's voice, died in a car accident in 2005), and so can some of the characters that appear later in the film. There's some really good animation here as well, plus some good songs, such as City of Light and Worthless, and the characters get into some very interesting situations on their journey.There are lots of popular animated films featuring anthropomorphic animals, but anthropomorphic appliances? This is definitely something unusual and bizarre! I haven't read Thomas M. Disch's book of the same name, which this movie is based on (I never even knew it was based on a book until just before my most recent viewing), but I'm sure it's very similar. The Brave Little Toaster is probably not quite what you would usually expect from an animated family adventure movie. It has a rather strange, eerie feel to it, which I found when I was a kid and still find now, even though it has never really scared me. Mind you, there are parts that could scare little kids, such as Toaster's nightmare with the evil clown. I feel I should warn parents about that.

This is odd, as it's a super-important picture AND it was so well made. I really can't understand this--especially since this is one of the best horror films of the 1950s.The film begins in the Amazonian basin. Some researchers of out looking for previously undiscovered creatures. Richard Carlson is an ichthyologist (guy who studies fish) and Richard Denning is the rich guy financing the expedition. Julia Adams comes along because the film needed a hot babe to put in harm's way. While the audience knows that they will stumble upon the creature (heck, it's in the film's title--I pity the person who is surprised when it appears!), the film does a great job of leading up to it. They show little teasers--such as a hand coming out of the water or catch a quick glimpse--but you KNOW it's coming! And, interestingly, at first you feel a bit sorry for the creature, as Denning is determined to kill it and bring it back to America to gain fame for himself. Later, however, the creature appears to be the hunter--and the film becomes tense and exciting.While the plot of this film is amazingly simple, there is a lot to like. While crappy sea monsters abound in horror films of the era, this one is far from it. Even today, more than 50 years later, you have to marvel at the costume that looks almost real. Heck, even the gills on the monster's neck flare in and out, as the special effects masters really pulled out all the stops. Additionally, the film had lots of amazing underwater cinematography--and it didn't end up looking like some back lot swimming pool, either, but a real freshwater lagoon! Great stuff and probably one of the most spectacular films of its day.So, you have a simple, yet interesting plot. You have amazing effects. You have great tension that builds and builds. What more could you want in a horror film?!

She is about to graduate college and has spent the last four years being very happy--and caring less about her future. She's the president of her sorority, homecoming queen and has a great fashion sense. Her plans after graduation are to marry her college sweetheart...period. However, when the boyfriend announces that he's going to Harvard law school and gives her the brushoff, at a spur of the moment she decides she's going to Harvard law as well! While no one would think she had a brain, it turns out Elle is at the top of her class and scores a nearly perfect LSAT--and she, too, is admitted to this prestigious institution. There, however, she's like a fish out of water--and everyone laughs at the audacious and seemingly out to lunch blonde. Will Elle fail or rise to the top? No big surprises here, but it sure is a nice ride.LEGALLY BLONDE is a movie that has no pretense. It knows it's not great art and won't be winning Oscars, yet it also is clever enough to avoid stereotypes or at least defy them. It also knows darn well that the plot is utterly ridiculous but runs with it. However, this isn't so bad, as sometimes you just need to turn off your brain and enjoy a film for what it is--entertainment. I know I am a super-critical person (hence, my 7100+ reviews on IMDb so far), but occasionally it's nice to see a film that isn't an independent film, art film, foreign film or silent--all types of films I usually watch. Sometimes you just need some brain candy! Excellent acting, a nice light directorial touch and good writing make this a standout film--and a lot better than you'd probably imagine.

She's a waitress who is fired for her clumsiness and finds herself helpless and alone. Her fantasy is at once more focused and much longer than Walter Mitty's -- and it's shared by everyone else on the screen.Farrow goes to the 1930s movie theater for relief from the pressures of Depression-era New York. During her fifth viewing of the crummy adventure film, The Purple Rose of Cairo, one of the actors, Jeff Daniels, notices her and steps off screen to woo her.Daniels pulls her out into the streets. The audience is outraged that the movie has been interrupted, and the other characters in the movie are stuck up there on the screen, shouting for Daniels to come back so they can finish the picture, kvetching that they want THEIR freedom from the movie too.When the news of the desertion of Daniel's character, Tom Baxter, reaches Hollywood, the producers and agents go ape. What if the Baxter character starts to rob banks and rape women? A Hollywood lawyer scowls and says darkly, I smell lawsuits. The team fly in from Hollywood to track down the miscreant couple.This must be a tricky sort of thing to write. After all, it could be a one-gag story. Actor steps off screen and woos audience member. What do I do NOW, Ma? On top of that, or rather under that, is the serious wintry theme of depression, poverty, spousal disagreements, the state of New Jersey, and other disasters, real or impending.So the rest of the movie, after the fantasy is first realized, has to be handled delicately, blending amusing whimsy with gloomy reality, along the lines of Shakespeare's dark comedies. And it must all lead to some dramatically satisfying conclusion.How does Woody manage these problems? With moderate success. I don't care how much of a nihilist he is, his sense of humor never really deserts him, and the mostly dramatic story that follows is pepped up by the occasional joke. The newly liberated Tom Baxter (in safari suit and pith helmet) takes Farrow to a night club to romance her. When the bill comes, he offers the waiter fake movie money, in all seriousness. And when they rush out and jump into the nearest car, he's puzzled because it won't move of its own accord. There is no ignition key but in Baxter's experience, every time he leaps into a car in the movies, it roars off. When Danny Aiello is about to slap his wife around, Baxter begins a fist fight and gets clobbered by the brutish husband. He's more confused than hurt, because he always wins his fights on the screen.But that fight is an example of the kind of thing that keeps the film from taking off. It's serious and it's sad, and the movie has much more of that than it has jokes. The shabby, wintry landscape doesn't give the film any pep either. The amusement park is strewn with dead leaves, everything closed for the season.The climax is a little disappointing too. The real Jeff Daniels arrives in town, makes pitches to Farrow, and talks the Daniels character into returning to the movie in the local theater, then he takes off for Hollywood again, leaving Farrow pretty much bereft back in Jersey.But not entirely bankrupt. She returns to the theater and there are Fred and Ginger dancing with skill and grace to Cheek to Cheek. The message seems to be that when life gets a little too tough to handle, she can retreat into the fantasies provided by movies.That's okay.

","genre":"Drama, Romance"},{"date":"6 September 2009","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Looks are deceiving would be an adequate way to describe the The Elephant Man as a film from the outside, but it would be a horribly amateur way to describe its message. David Lynch's film soars beyond mere pity for those with life-altering physical abnormalities and serves as more than just a slap on the wrist to a generally unsympathetic public. It is a study of the human condition and Lynch's camera a microscope examining one of its most fragile examples.Taking place in Victorian London and filmed like a classic '30s or '40s film in black and white, The Elephant Man carries that classic naive sensibility that combined with the hideous deformities of its central character, creates a bit of horror and suspense before it appeals to our better nature by eliciting sympathy and understanding.John Merrick (John Hurt) is The Elephant Man to the abusive owner exploiting him in a freak show, but when Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins), a doctor studying anatomy, finds him and sees him for the first time, a tear runs down Hopkins' face in a powerful close-up and the doctor brings him to hospital, nursing him to health and soon socializing him.It's a fascinating story. For the first half hour we're hooked by sheer curiosity over what John looks like and how he came to be, a technique that catches one of our most unflattering flaws in that we gape at the unknown and the abnormal. It then shows us more and more of John, slowly unveiling his humanity, and suddenly we're converted and incredibly protective of this unusual character.The film provides an array of human reactions to seeing\/meeting someone so terribly disfigured. Treves' wife, for example, cries uncontrollably out of pity, a famous actress treats him like a fascinating human being, a nurse screams at the sight of him and sadly many exploit him. This broad spectrum fully puts you in John's shoes and leaves you with incredible insight into his unique situation.As a filmmaker, Lynch leads us quite easily to our own discoveries about what John's story teaches us.

David Lynch's film soars beyond mere pity for those with life-altering physical abnormalities and serves as more than just a slap on the wrist to a generally unsympathetic public. It is a study of the human condition and Lynch's camera a microscope examining one of its most fragile examples.Taking place in Victorian London and filmed like a classic '30s or '40s film in black and white, The Elephant Man carries that classic naive sensibility that combined with the hideous deformities of its central character, creates a bit of horror and suspense before it appeals to our better nature by eliciting sympathy and understanding.John Merrick (John Hurt) is The Elephant Man to the abusive owner exploiting him in a freak show, but when Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins), a doctor studying anatomy, finds him and sees him for the first time, a tear runs down Hopkins' face in a powerful close-up and the doctor brings him to hospital, nursing him to health and soon socializing him.It's a fascinating story. For the first half hour we're hooked by sheer curiosity over what John looks like and how he came to be, a technique that catches one of our most unflattering flaws in that we gape at the unknown and the abnormal. It then shows us more and more of John, slowly unveiling his humanity, and suddenly we're converted and incredibly protective of this unusual character.The film provides an array of human reactions to seeing\/meeting someone so terribly disfigured. Treves' wife, for example, cries uncontrollably out of pity, a famous actress treats him like a fascinating human being, a nurse screams at the sight of him and sadly many exploit him. This broad spectrum fully puts you in John's shoes and leaves you with incredible insight into his unique situation.As a filmmaker, Lynch leads us quite easily to our own discoveries about what John's story teaches us.

Especially getting to see Sean Connery albeit in a supporting role. Face it, twenty years earlier Connery would have been a natural for the part.

Be that as it may, he's an earnest young Highland warrior whom we see as first in modern era of 1986 New York and then in his beginnings when he finds out he is an immortal. Most of the cops are interested in solving a present day homicide, but Roxanne Hart who is an expert in metallurgy finds an opponent's sword below Madison Square Garden and realizes it's an antique made of the best Toledo steel and priceless. That sends her into some unusual directions to find out just who is this guy the cops picked up near the crime scene.The immortals ranks have trimmed and as Sean Connery figured it over 400 years ago one of the two left will be the Kurgan, a truly evil man with impressive battle skills played by Clancy Brown. Between Brown and Jeff Kober, these two have brought us some of the best psychotic villains in the last 30 years. Brown is at his worst as the Kurgan.Which brings me to the flashback where another immortal played by Connery sees in MacLeod the warrior who can defeat the Kurgan for the immortal championship. That is called the Quickening and of course it's not reached on the television series. It's not really explained there either, but trust me it's not something you want the Kurgan to experience.I was not disappointed in the slightest in the film version of Highlander.

So, if you can't accept this sort of premise, just skip the film--and most 1950s horror films, as such ideas are pretty much par for the course during this era! However, providing you can suspend disbelief, it's well worth seeing and is a bit better than the average film of the era.The film begins with the discovery of a corpse that baffles the police. While they THINK they know who it is, his face is so badly distorted they aren't positive about the identification. Although the professor (Leo G. Carroll) has identified this as his co-researcher, they have the Doctor (John Agar) examine the body as well. Carroll announces that his friend died from acromegalia (I have always heard it referred to as acromegaly--I think the movie got this wrong). Agar is stumped, as this is a progressive disease and the distortions (and gigantism) caused by the disease take a very long time--not practically overnight, as Carroll asserts. But the cops are pretty content to accept Carroll's version and the case is closed.Well, it turns out that the weird anomalies were caused by a drug that the guy injected into himself! And, for that matter, so did another of their assistants. Why they exactly did this is never quite clear, as it's a concoction they've been working on to deal with starvation and increasing the size of food crops. As for Carroll he isn't stupid enough to do this himself, but in an odd twist the crazed research assistant (now sporting the same mask used in ABBOTT AND COSTELLO MEET DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE) attacks Carroll--injecting him as well as destroying the lab. Because the formula takes time to have an effect on humans, Carroll is okay for the time being.As for his research, almost all the research animals are gone--burned in a fire caused by the crazed assistant. However, a large tarantula (because of the injection) escapes and continues to grow. Eventually, it's larger than a house and rather nasty--stripping animals and people to the bone as it eats them. An entomologist (Raymond Bailey--'Mr. Drysdale' without his toupee) talks to Agar about tarantulas and explains that this is how tarantulas eat--stripping the meat off bones. However, in reality they NEVER, EVER eat their prey life this. All spiders inject their prey with digestive juices that turn the poor creature's innards to slush--after which, the spider slurps the insides out--leaving the shell of the creature. Boy did the movie get this wrong.Later, the spider does a ton of damage and the puny humans try to stop it with no success. Electricity, dynamite and bullets have no effect and the spiders is about to eat the town when, suddenly, Clint Eastwood and some other pilots come to the rescue with napalm! And, very abruptly (too abruptly) the thing dies and the credits roll.The film gets kudos for excellent special effects for the spider and a story that is quite enjoyable fun. Negatives are the who stripping victims of their flesh as well as the amazing abruptness of the ending. Not great but good and worth a look.

He also visits a guy in jail that has it out for him and it is a rather funny scene too. The supporting cast is good and over the top too and we even get an early appearance by Jim Carrey in this one as an wild singer who is strung out on heroin. Liam Neeson plays the director who made out the deadpool to begin with and he is always good in his roles, even when they are rather minor. So a rather good end to the Dirty Harry series, it might would have been nice if they made one more where he was retired and still kicking butt, but it had to end at some point.

But this is the only time anyone should apply the word 'wonderful' when talking of Batman Forever as in this case, the translation is one that is certainly a lot more colourful, but in equal regard &#x96; one that is certainly more dull. The translation isn't quite limited to expressionistic-inspired sets and mise-en-scene, or lack of, but additionally the attitudes towards the female characters and the focus on the villains being of a variety that leads them to become scarred and deranged, rather than naturally so.I still maintain that Burton's 'Returns' in the best Batman film; a film that balances a struggling lead with a naturally deformed and deranged villain whom is placed on a career ladder that will ultimately lead to power by way of politics. The film systematically taps into what is a public obsession for a 'hero' of the tragic variety, or a celebrity figure in which to lead them out of, what they perceive to be, a mire of some sort that they're in. Batman Forever's villains are of your bog-standard, sadistic, fast-tracked sort that are scarred in a physical sense but require everything to be rosy before they almost instantly turn to homicidal behaviour. You'll remember that Returns' chief antagonist, The Penguin, was initially embraced by the people of Gotham in what was a calm and methodical approach to a superhero film on Burton's behalf as this creature mingled with the inhabitants; grew more powerful in the process and thus established a position of power of our hero Batman. In Forever, the bad-guys are practically screaming and shouting from the off &#x96; promising noise, carnage and mayhem wherever and whenever possible in what is a tired display.The film has a certain compulsion to it; a certain and distracting sense of the obligatory. We never really feel as if our leads will be hurt, or are in much peril and there's never really a sense Batman could be injured or killed; the antagonists, at least one of them, is going for the very basic goal of control, manipulation and possession of the people in the city before eyeing the actual city itself as one big prize. So there's nothing new there and for all the glitz, colour and energy, it's actually quite sad to see the film eventually delve into a final act that sees a damsel in distress, quite literally locked in a tower, require rescuing from her (dark) knight in (shining?) armour.In regards to the woman of the piece, the supposed love interest for Batman, it is Nicole Kidman that plays Chase Meridian, a doctor an educated and somewhat prestigious person whom embodies, or should embody, intellect and independence. Her strong and independent character is, early on, demonstrated in her office as she boxes a punch-bag, thus establishing a degree of 'hard-bodiedness' to her character. The trouble is, she doesn't. She's one of the loosest female psychologists that's probably ever been put to screen, and comes complete with some terrible, flirtatious lines of dialogue that wouldn't be out of place in a low-rent, erotic thriller. Upon meeting her for the first time, Jim Carrey's Edward Nygma exclaims what a 'pursuit' she must be, poking fun at her name 'Chase', but that's exactly the problem; she's nothing more than a chase; a 'pursuit'; a prize; ultimately, a trophy partner.If Selena Kyle, in the previous entry, went from rounded; plain and somewhat submissive secretary in the male-driven world of business, enterprising and globalisation, to the lone; independent; dominant and powerful Catwoman, then Chase goes in the opposite direction. She begins somewhat smart, before gradually falling to the level in which she exists purely so that she can look good and be rescued. There is one point, very early on, in which Chase references Catwoman in a dialogue exchange with Batman. She states that perhaps he'd take to her more if she were dressed in vinyl and came equipped with a whip, in what is a clear homage. The trouble is, Catwoman's utilisation of these aspects of mise-en-scene, in her costume and props respectively, helped define both her identity and characteristics; with Chase Meridian in Batman Forever; it's a leery, sexually-driven and somewhat pathetic suggestion which serves as nothing, bar a means to 'satisfy' the man she's got her eye on.The film details Nygma's disgruntled descent into madness within a capitalist driven and increasingly high pressured lifestyle reasonably well; taking time to document his growing interest in homicidal activity as he gleefully observes the circus hijack-come-massacre on partner-in-crime-to-be Two Face's (Lee-Jones) behalf, while balancing the invention he's made that might double up as an allegory for what happens when advanced and powerful weapons fall into the wrong hands.But everything is punctuated by annoying tidbits of this and that. Remember in 2008's The Dark Knight when Michael Caine, playing Alfred, states some clap-trap about how, years ago, when he was in the army and based in Burma, he once had to destroy a large patch of vegetation purely to catch a jewel thief; enforcing the ideology that in order to stop destruction and wrong-doing, sometimes caution must thrown to the wind in the process. Well, these sorts of annoying moral-boosting-speeches-come-pit-stops seem to have been around longer than I thought, as we learn in Batman Forever that Broken wings mend and that Robin will fly again following near-death experiences at the hands of Two Face, and everyone needs geeing up. The series went on to hit a critical all-time low before branching out into a box-office all-time high. In regards to the franchise, I'll stick with my 'Returns' and let everyone else get on with what they feel as if they're supposed to enjoy.
