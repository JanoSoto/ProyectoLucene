[{"date":"26 October 2000","score":"","review":"  Election takes a new twist on political satires like Bulworth, Primary Colors, and Wag The Dog.  This film has the setting of a high school presidential election.  Tracy Flick is an over-achiever and the leading candidate; she is the only candidate in the school's election.  Reese Witherspoon plays her to perfection.  She is perky, spirited, smart, and in the eyes of one teacher (Matthew Broderick) demonic. Tracy has already inadvertently gotten one teacher fired by having an affair with him.  Mr. McAllister (Broderick) tries to steer clear of Ms. Flick, but being her teacher and head advisor of the student counsel, he finds that task rather difficult.  To try and keep himself from any possible danger he seeks the help of the high school's ex-football star Paul Metzler. Knowing full well that Metzler will never play football again he encourages him to run against Tracy in the election.  Chris Klein plays Metzler with such a goofy charm working for him that I would find it hard to believe that anyone couldn't like him. The third party is Tammy Metzler who is only running to get back at her brother and his girlfriend, Lisa.  You see, Paul doesn't realize it, but before he was dating Lisa she was dating Tammy.  Angered, and love-scorned, Tammy runs the type of campaign I remember from Brewster's Millions, and tells the voters not to vote at all.  She is very funny and very malicious, with what one might call a soft spot. Election also explores McAllister's home life, which is a little boring, and so is his sex life.  His wife wants a baby and is using sex solely for that purpose.  However unromantic the sex scenes are, they are quite hysterical. He fantasizes about affairs with a friend of the family and Tracy Flick. Matthew Broderick is in a small way horrifying to watch in this role. Remember that he was once Ferris Bueller.  He is often disgusting, and pitiful, but always there to laugh at, and very loudly at times.  The best scene of the movie is Broderick staring in desperation into the large face of a vending machine. This film works on many levels, not one of which would be as a teenage comedy.  This is not She's All That, nor is it Never Been Kissed.  It is darker, and it knows it.  As far as political-satires go, Election is the best I've seen, and to think, it's school-political-satire.  The levels of the performances are outstanding.  Matthew Broderick has recently had a very bad spell (Godzilla, and Inspector Gadget).  Here he hits the right note playing the teacher mildly and seriously.  Reese Witherspoon smothers the screen with her huge smile and striking personality, even if it persuades you to hate her.  Chris Klein who also stars in this year's American Pie (almost the same role), reminds me of a young Keanu Reeves in films like River's Edge and Parenthood. Like most of the films I mentioned in the above statement Election is not for everyone.  Some people will be disgusted, some will be offended, and some will turn it off.  I believe in the realism of this movie.  I believe in a world unbound by censorship and an industry able to make this art, imitating life, imitating art.  Perhaps one day we will all understand the significance of these movies.  I should have run for class office.
