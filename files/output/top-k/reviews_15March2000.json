Written by Peter Steinfeld. Running time 95 minutes. Rated PG-13 (for thematic elements, language, sexuality, and some violence).I've always been vulnerable to the genre of slapstick comedy. When movies spoof with screwball or physical humor, for me it is a struggle not to break down in laughter. Drowning Mona may not be a truly worthy production, but the film does offer funny concepts within its contents, some that are hilarious with punctuality. This comedy touches ironic base with nearly every topic possible, from murder to lesbianism, and accidents to brutality. There are laughs regarding plot jokes, concepts, one liners, physical pranks, and visual gags. Director Nick Gomez is careful not to go too far over the top in his movie's parody but still pushes the boundaries of burlesque cinema in an interesting manor.No one mourns over the death of Mona Dearly--a woman so brutally mean spirited and uncompromisingly inferior, even her husband rejoices of her demise. Mona dies tragically in an automobile accident within a small outcast town after she losses her car brakes and plunges off the road into a lake below. Hardly anyone comes to her funeral, except her husband, Phil Dearly (William Fichtner), and her fully grown son, who owns a landscaping business with a friend named Bobby Calzone (Casey Affleck). The entire town seems to be rejoicing over the loss of this putrid, hated citizen. I've seen people more upset over losing change in a candy machine, explains a character in one scene. Through flashbacks, we learn why. Mona does horrible things like smashing her son's co-worker's car with a golf club, accuses people, commits dastardly deeds, chops her own offspring's limb off, and is a poor sport at nearly every event we witness.The movie is filled with a variety of wondering and well-cast characters. They include Wyatt Rash (Danny DeVito), a local sheriff who is convinced that the death of Mona Dearly was no accident and considers everyone who hated Mona (every individual who knew her) a suspect. Ellen (Neve Campbell), the daughter of Rash, engaged and impregnated by Bobby. Rona, (Jamie Lee Curtis) a chain smoking waitress who is having an affair with Phil. Rona, however, is cheating on Phil with his son. There is also a local fisherman who seems to witness ever important incident that occurs.I enjoyed the film's appropriately zany and fun characters a lot. Each is somewhat interesting and well depicted by talented actors and actresses. Mona Dearly is one of the most hilariously overacted character's I have seen in quite some time. Bette Midler is the perfect choice for Mona, with her exaggerated gestures and reactions.  Her performance supplies half of the picture's effective funny moments.Downing Mona is certainly not a perfect production. It has several massive problems contained within the story and characters. The audience doesn't learn whether this is a movie about the mysterious death of a local woman, agonizing wedding preparations for a young embraced pair, a police detective's investigation of an alleged murder, an independent and struggling landscaping company, an adulterous affair, and even boneless chicken is figured into the equation. Some of these scenarios do not seem to recognize the presence of the others, proving what little narrative connection they have with each other.The film also desperately attempts to fulfill unexplained nuggets the story brings forth in non-chronologically based orders that never really clarify ideas. Although some of these incidences induce laughs and intrigue, the funny material needs to be in reference with the plot, not outside the story's boundaries.The movie's mystery is not as sufficient as it could have been. It is infectious and interesting, but unfocused and drifted. Though amusing and twisted, the whodunit concept is lackadaisical and flat--concluding with a lazy and disappointing situation. I adored the film's soundtrack, however, which consists of a variety of popular melodies and catchy rhythmical tones. The included music induces suspicion as well as mood settings and an effective black comedy atmosphere.Drowning Mona works as a slapstick comedy because of two reasons. 1) The subject matter is literal and serious, creating an obscure yet black funny mood, and 2) the actors create screwball personalities for their characters. If this kind of comedy has those elements, it nearly guarantees its success. I give this film a recommendation to fans of its gender, albeit marginally.Brought to you by Destination Films.

In all scenes where they are together (most of the film) they just click and everything is very natural and believable.Robert pretty much puts his own sex\/love life on hold so that he can be a real father to their son Sam -- very well played by Malcolm Stumpf.Abbie does the same -- but when Mr Right walks into her life (Benjamin Bratt as Ben) the deck is shuffled and a new hand is dealt. The conflict in the movie arises when Ben is offered a partnership in his banking firm -- but it requires him to move to New York. Robert is not about to lose his parenting rights as Sam's father.  A fairly ugly legal battle ensues in which a lot of low blows are given -- and taken -- by both Robert and Abbie; ruining what was one of those rare 'friendship-of-a-lifetime' relationships.Abbie needs to do what she believes is best for her and, ultimately, Sam.  Robert needs to do what he believes is best for Sam and ultimately him; he cannot give up his landscaping business to follow his child to the concrete canyons of New York City.Neil Patrick Harris (the child star of Doogie Howser, MD) doesn't have enough screen time as the HIV+ young man whose life partner has died of AIDS.  (Pneumonia to his partner's family.)  But in the small amount of time he is on the screen his performance is stellar.Illiana Douglas as Elizabeth Ryder (Robert's attorney) turns in a surprisingly subdued performance -- an attorney you will actually like and root for.Lynn Redgrave and Josef Sommer are great as Robert's parents -- willing to support their son both emotionally and financially to see that their grandson is allowed to live with their gay son as his child.  They were both fantastic.Their are some great little plot twists and courtroom revelations that will surprise and entice you.  The lengths that both Abbie and Robert go to to keep individual custody (and the reasons behind those lengths) are sad but believable if you have ever seen a real life child custody case.This is probably Madonna's best performance ever -- but there seem to be a lot of Madonna Bashers out there that are going to pan this film just because of their (erroneous) belief that Madonna is not an actor.One of her best scenes is alone in front of the mirror when she pushes her breasts up high and perky and says 1989 and then drops them to their natural position and says 1999.  Too funny for words.There are many great one-liners and the entire script is a finely honed piece of art.

By the time we get to the predictable Big Game at the end, we're ready for the movie to end.Still, Sunday had some pluses. Jamie Foxx did well. So did Al Pacino. Lawrence Taylor was decent, considering he's a football player and not an actor. Also, all the quick camera cuts and hard-driving music manage to give a sense of intensity that the dialogue fails to deliver.On the other hand, it would've been nice to see the pace of the movie slow down at times. The constant fast pace wears thin, since Sunday is so long. I noticed that one of the songs used also was used in the movie Run, Lola, Run, which also was very fast paced but lasted about half as long as Sunday. Oliver Stone should've taken that idea, too, from Lola. Also, Cameron Diaz is wasted.

Having said that, I think its time that Hollywood moves on and gets over it. There will never be another movie in this genre that is as good as Aliens, so any derivative of Aliens is a pointless waste of time and money. I'd rather watch a good movie again than see a bad remake of that movie, so the next time a film like Pitch Black comes along I'll simply pull out my dusty copy of Aliens and save myself the 8 bucks.This is more a criticism of Hollywood than anything else, I'm sure it must be hard to come up with a premise that involves aliens on a distant planet that does not in some way pay homage to a movie like Aliens or Alien. For me it was hard not to draw parallels between this film and the movies I grew up with, and it was impossible for me to see it as an original plot concept. Do the aliens in these shows ever do anything besides eat people? I mean, is that their sole function in life? Lets think of something more interesting for the monsters to do in the next Aliens rip-off. Maybe the aliens aren't hungry at all, or if they are hungry, maybe all they eat is people's shoes and socks. Now we're getting somewhere.The premise.Humans in the future without enough navigational sense to stay clear of solar systems when traveling at near light speed, crash on an unnamed, unknown planet in a strange solar system that for some bizarre reason has 3 suns. I don't know why the producers went with 3 suns as opposed to 2 suns, especially considering the fact that most solar systems are in fact binary, except to maybe make the little ones in the audience say Aw cool, 3 suns! The survivors, who are not very bright to begin with, are then presented with the extra little problem of having an escaped murder loose amongst them. His name is Riddick and for the first ½ hour of the movie they look around for him instead of looking for food or water! Lets get our priorities straight shall we? First thing you do after crashing on an alien planet is look for food we all know that, then you see how much Diet Dr. Pepper survived the crash of course, then you look for the escaped murders.. Sheesh. Where did these people learn to forage?Let the clichés begin!Of course the planet is totally dead with no water and no apparent life or ecosystem, and yet low and behold there is a breathable atmosphere! What a shock. Also with 3 suns it's only just a little hotter than Earth in summer, how convenient! I'd think that 3 suns might make for some interesting plot twists about the crew fighting over the shady spot, but sadly nothing that interesting occurs in the film. At one point the survivors come across a vast field of bones, presumably from the herds of animals that once roamed this planet with 3 suns and no water. Exactly how vast herds of giant herbivores would evolve in a desert is not as interesting to the crew as how the skeletons are all lined up, as if they died at the same time standing up. Foreshadowing, what a concept! The high school English teacher of the movies writer must be so proud. Later on we find out that there is a whole species of underground carnivores who are just waiting for the lights to go out so they can feast upon the multitude of juicy humans who crash land on their nasty little planet every so often. Oh yes, I can see how 6 or 7 dehydrated humans every few years could sustain a huge group of meat eating, shade loving monsters for years to come. Humans would have to be pretty filling for that to be true, especially when you consider that these voracious creatures have seemingly eaten all other life on the planet. Wouldn't they have eaten themselves into extinction? Apparently not. The monsters are also afraid of light, or are harmed by it or something, the bottom line is they just don't like light ok? So our humans are safe as long as there is a lot of light, and in a 3-sun solar system that doesn't seem to be a problem.But luckily for us the crash happens just hours before a once-every-22-year eclipse that the beasties have been waiting for so they can get out of their shady holes and eat all the starving, dehydrated, hapless, defenseless humans that have crash landed on their dusty little planet. This eclipse does not cover just one sun, or even 2 suns. Astoundingly it covers a remarkable 3 suns, go figure. That coincidence is not as great as them crashing only a few yards from an abandoned mining camp, where they learn all about the impending eclipse from a home made model of the solar system made by the previous owners of the camp. The miners were also in the process of leaving the camp in a spaceship they had, but didn't quite make it. These people had a spaceship, A Spaceship! And they had to build a little mock solar system out of foam balls and coat hangers? Isn't this supposed to be the future, couldn't they have figured out the alignment of the planets from the computer on their.. Spaceship??? Did I mention they had a spaceship? If I had a spaceship I don't think I'd go be a miner on some weird planet with no water and lots of monsters. I'd keep looking till I found a planet with lots of water, and no monsters. Then I'd relax and get a job making web pages, or their future equivalent. This is supposed to be the future right?So the crew is then eaten one by one in various gory but uninteresting ways, and since the characters are so profoundly un-heroic and uninteresting, we really don't care. In fact we want them to get eaten so we can see the creatures do their thing some more. At one point you start rooting for the monsters so you can hear the gory body breaking noises.Here comes another criticism of Hollywood, can't they think of something more frightening than being eaten? People just aren't as scared of being chewed on as they were back in the 70's when Jaws came out, and they have been getting gradually less and less terrified of it for the last 30 years. I personally am not very worried about being swallowed whole or ripped apart by a huge beast in my every day life. Maybe if I was a Lion tamer or a Crocodile wrangler this movie might scare the pants off me! But as I am a graphic designer by trade I'd be much more scared of a movie about computers that come to life and start making artistic designs on their own, putting me out of work. Well its more likely than anything that happens in Pitch Black.How could this movie have been made better?I'm glad you asked. Well for starter lets stop making the bad guy in movies look like a wrestler. I know wrestling is very popular right now and all that, but in reality no one looks like these people. And people who look like the bad guy in this movie are generally speaking not very tough, they just work out with weights a lot. The toughest people I have even seen are bikers, and if you have seen what they look like you know they don't spend too much time in a gym. Or conversely you could make him look like a totally normal person, that way when he does turn out to be an exceptionally talented murder the audience would be forced to say, Gee, he looks like a totally normal person. How could he be such an exceptionally talented murderer?Too much foreshadowing!They spent so much time at the beginning of the movie trying to make the planet look scary that by the time the scary stuff happened, it wasn't a surprise. It would have been better if there were hints of something bad that had happened in the past, but making it obvious that something bad had occurred made it very anti-climactic when it all came down. I would have liked to see the ecosystem in some state of recovery from the last time there was an eclipse. That would have given the nasty critters something else to do besides harass our hapless crash victims, they could have chased around the other animals and wreaked a little havoc on the environment rather than just play chase the humans. That might have made the creatures seem more real rather than just 2 dimensional hapless human harassers. Also, I think the creatures should have been in hibernation waiting for the next eclipse, rather than skittering around in the tunnels. How would they findenough food between eclipses with all the animals that did live on the surface being dead and all?Live humans are more interesting than dead ones.For example the people from the mining camp would have been more interesting if they were alive, like walking around and doing stuff. Maybe they would have seen the crash and gone out to rescue any survivors, now that sounds like something live humans would do. This would have been better than the cliché of we crash landed only feet or inches from a settlement, lucky us.We crash-landed, we have no way home.sob, sob.This is such a tired premise, especially when 30 minutes into the film they do find a way to get home and it becomes a plot device. (i.e. we have to drag the power cells from the crashed ship to the new ship, etc. etc. etc.) Come on! Make it a scientific mission that's there to study the eclipse or something, that would have defused the cliché of Hey cool, we arrived here just in the nick of time to witness a once in a thousand year cosmic event.How are the Special Effects?I have no idea, I couldn't see them. Basically the plot revolves around the fact that these nasty critters only come out when its pitch black... need I say more? Literally there is not one shot of a full monster in the light, so all you ever see is them in silhouette.In closing I'll just say this, its not a scary or entertaining movie but if you can get into a matinee for $3.00 I say go for it. You'll have fun at least trying to comprehend how anyone as stupid as the people in this movie ever learned how to fly spaceships in the first place.Lobo69 ","genre":null},{"date":"15 March 2000","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Pitch Black - Hollywood, Get Over Aliens Already!Aliens was a great movie, probably the best sequel ever and on its own one of the best action movies ever made.

Oh yes, I can see how 6 or 7 dehydrated humans every few years could sustain a huge group of meat eating, shade loving monsters for years to come. Humans would have to be pretty filling for that to be true, especially when you consider that these voracious creatures have seemingly eaten all other life on the planet. Wouldn't they have eaten themselves into extinction? Apparently not. The monsters are also afraid of light, or are harmed by it or something, the bottom line is they just don't like light ok? So our humans are safe as long as there is a lot of light, and in a 3-sun solar system that doesn't seem to be a problem.But luckily for us the crash happens just hours before a once-every-22-year eclipse that the beasties have been waiting for so they can get out of their shady holes and eat all the starving, dehydrated, hapless, defenseless humans that have crash landed on their dusty little planet. This eclipse does not cover just one sun, or even 2 suns. Astoundingly it covers a remarkable 3 suns, go figure. That coincidence is not as great as them crashing only a few yards from an abandoned mining camp, where they learn all about the impending eclipse from a home made model of the solar system made by the previous owners of the camp. The miners were also in the process of leaving the camp in a spaceship they had, but didn't quite make it. These people had a spaceship, A Spaceship! And they had to build a little mock solar system out of foam balls and coat hangers? Isn't this supposed to be the future, couldn't they have figured out the alignment of the planets from the computer on their.. Spaceship??? Did I mention they had a spaceship? If I had a spaceship I don't think I'd go be a miner on some weird planet with no water and lots of monsters. I'd keep looking till I found a planet with lots of water, and no monsters. Then I'd relax and get a job making web pages, or their future equivalent. This is supposed to be the future right?So the crew is then eaten one by one in various gory but uninteresting ways, and since the characters are so profoundly un-heroic and uninteresting, we really don't care. In fact we want them to get eaten so we can see the creatures do their thing some more. At one point you start rooting for the monsters so you can hear the gory body breaking noises.Here comes another criticism of Hollywood, can't they think of something more frightening than being eaten? People just aren't as scared of being chewed on as they were back in the 70's when Jaws came out, and they have been getting gradually less and less terrified of it for the last 30 years. I personally am not very worried about being swallowed whole or ripped apart by a huge beast in my every day life. Maybe if I was a Lion tamer or a Crocodile wrangler this movie might scare the pants off me! But as I am a graphic designer by trade I'd be much more scared of a movie about computers that come to life and start making artistic designs on their own, putting me out of work. Well its more likely than anything that happens in Pitch Black.How could this movie have been made better?I'm glad you asked. Well for starter lets stop making the bad guy in movies look like a wrestler. I know wrestling is very popular right now and all that, but in reality no one looks like these people. And people who look like the bad guy in this movie are generally speaking not very tough, they just work out with weights a lot. The toughest people I have even seen are bikers, and if you have seen what they look like you know they don't spend too much time in a gym. Or conversely you could make him look like a totally normal person, that way when he does turn out to be an exceptionally talented murder the audience would be forced to say, Gee, he looks like a totally normal person. How could he be such an exceptionally talented murderer?Too much foreshadowing!They spent so much time at the beginning of the movie trying to make the planet look scary that by the time the scary stuff happened, it wasn't a surprise. It would have been better if there were hints of something bad that had happened in the past, but making it obvious that something bad had occurred made it very anti-climactic when it all came down. I would have liked to see the ecosystem in some state of recovery from the last time there was an eclipse. That would have given the nasty critters something else to do besides harass our hapless crash victims, they could have chased around the other animals and wreaked a little havoc on the environment rather than just play chase the humans. That might have made the creatures seem more real rather than just 2 dimensional hapless human harassers. Also, I think the creatures should have been in hibernation waiting for the next eclipse, rather than skittering around in the tunnels. How would they findenough food between eclipses with all the animals that did live on the surface being dead and all?Live humans are more interesting than dead ones.For example the people from the mining camp would have been more interesting if they were alive, like walking around and doing stuff. Maybe they would have seen the crash and gone out to rescue any survivors, now that sounds like something live humans would do. This would have been better than the cliché of we crash landed only feet or inches from a settlement, lucky us.We crash-landed, we have no way home.sob, sob.This is such a tired premise, especially when 30 minutes into the film they do find a way to get home and it becomes a plot device. (i.e. we have to drag the power cells from the crashed ship to the new ship, etc. etc. etc.) Come on! Make it a scientific mission that's there to study the eclipse or something, that would have defused the cliché of Hey cool, we arrived here just in the nick of time to witness a once in a thousand year cosmic event.How are the Special Effects?I have no idea, I couldn't see them. Basically the plot revolves around the fact that these nasty critters only come out when its pitch black... need I say more? Literally there is not one shot of a full monster in the light, so all you ever see is them in silhouette.In closing I'll just say this, its not a scary or entertaining movie but if you can get into a matinee for $3.00 I say go for it. You'll have fun at least trying to comprehend how anyone as stupid as the people in this movie ever learned how to fly spaceships in the first place.Lobo69 ","genre":"Horror, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"15 March 2000","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Pitch Black - Hollywood, Get Over Aliens Already!Aliens was a great movie, probably the best sequel ever and on its own one of the best action movies ever made. Having said that, I think its time that Hollywood moves on and gets over it. There will never be another movie in this genre that is as good as Aliens, so any derivative of Aliens is a pointless waste of time and money. I'd rather watch a good movie again than see a bad remake of that movie, so the next time a film like Pitch Black comes along I'll simply pull out my dusty copy of Aliens and save myself the 8 bucks.This is more a criticism of Hollywood than anything else, I'm sure it must be hard to come up with a premise that involves aliens on a distant planet that does not in some way pay homage to a movie like Aliens or Alien. For me it was hard not to draw parallels between this film and the movies I grew up with, and it was impossible for me to see it as an original plot concept. Do the aliens in these shows ever do anything besides eat people? I mean, is that their sole function in life? Lets think of something more interesting for the monsters to do in the next Aliens rip-off. Maybe the aliens aren't hungry at all, or if they are hungry, maybe all they eat is people's shoes and socks. Now we're getting somewhere.The premise.Humans in the future without enough navigational sense to stay clear of solar systems when traveling at near light speed, crash on an unnamed, unknown planet in a strange solar system that for some bizarre reason has 3 suns. I don't know why the producers went with 3 suns as opposed to 2 suns, especially considering the fact that most solar systems are in fact binary, except to maybe make the little ones in the audience say Aw cool, 3 suns! The survivors, who are not very bright to begin with, are then presented with the extra little problem of having an escaped murder loose amongst them. His name is Riddick and for the first ½ hour of the movie they look around for him instead of looking for food or water! Lets get our priorities straight shall we? First thing you do after crashing on an alien planet is look for food we all know that, then you see how much Diet Dr. Pepper survived the crash of course, then you look for the escaped murders.. Sheesh. Where did these people learn to forage?Let the clichés begin!Of course the planet is totally dead with no water and no apparent life or ecosystem, and yet low and behold there is a breathable atmosphere! What a shock. Also with 3 suns it's only just a little hotter than Earth in summer, how convenient! I'd think that 3 suns might make for some interesting plot twists about the crew fighting over the shady spot, but sadly nothing that interesting occurs in the film. At one point the survivors come across a vast field of bones, presumably from the herds of animals that once roamed this planet with 3 suns and no water. Exactly how vast herds of giant herbivores would evolve in a desert is not as interesting to the crew as how the skeletons are all lined up, as if they died at the same time standing up. Foreshadowing, what a concept! The high school English teacher of the movies writer must be so proud. Later on we find out that there is a whole species of underground carnivores who are just waiting for the lights to go out so they can feast upon the multitude of juicy humans who crash land on their nasty little planet every so often.

So when you hold it up to all that it is a really horrible movie to not come out very entertaining. Most of the blame goes to the screenplay for the trite dialog and anticlimactic scenes, but I feel some of the blame has to go to De Palma.  It seems as if he has something against action.  At least for this movie, because it is as if he took every stop possible to take any action out of them scenes.  There is a scene where they have to find a hull breach on the ship as they are losing pressure.  The slow painstaking lethargic way they go about this is ridiculous.  I realize that they are floating in space but every action and movement is so slow it is almost unwatchable.  It's as if they are using the more suspenseful scenes to fill time so they draw them out almost endlessly.  They do it again when they are all floating outside the ship as well.  Then there is the cast. 2000 is not the year of Gary Sinise .  After reindeer turds . I mean reindeer games he has this.  He and Robbins don't seem to be trying at all.

I do have to complain about at least one more scene in here.

Teenagers are without remorse, pity, emotion, or feeling. They hang out, disrupt stuff, kill, steal, have meaningless sex, blah blah blah.  Has Mr.Araki seen A Clockwork Orange?  Or even Natural Born Killers, for that matter, where after all the senseless violence, we witness a reasoned argument from Woody Harrelson for his actions?And as far as shock value is concerned, I'll admit I was entertained the first time the cast entered a store, killed the clerk, stole, and then had sex.  Great.  Message received.  But  to see the same 2 scenes six times over again, well, no more shock value.  Maybe that's the point, you say? Well, duh!  Of course it's the point!  But we don't need to be hit over the head with it six times!!
