I was neither the Spiderman nazi who thought that the only way a decent Spiderman movie would be made was if I made it myself, nor was I waiting in line a week before opening weekend dressed like Mary Jane. I went in with an open mind. Unfortunately I came out with a bad taste in my mouth.One of the biggest mistakes made with this movie was that they tuckered themselves out trying to rationalize Spiderman mythology. MILITARY FUNDING FOR A BAT-GLIDER?! WHY THE NAME OF F. MURRAY ABRAHAM DOES THE MILITARY NEED A BAT GLIDER?! Why couldn't they just leave that out until he gets all crazy like and makes all his cute little goblin cache of wacky weapons? A bat glider that you have to dress up like a mighty morphing power ranger to control nonetheless. I would have no problem with William Dafoe as Green Goblin if he had a simple costume that complimented his already goblin like features.

If Scott had stayed with that plan nothing would have gone wrong, except that the movie would have been just another war movie (except the setting -somalia- and that it would have been a great war movie.Unfortunately we meet lots of soldiers -and I mean a lot... the only 5 I could distinguish were Bana, McGregor, Sizemore and the guy from armageddon and pearl harbor ...fichtner. But even then  the all wore the same clothes, helmets and had the same hairstyles It really made the feel of confusion poor from the screen because the viewer had no idea who was shot to pieces. But I can't help to wonder if that was the idea.

I can't tell one soldier from another so I have to ASSUME that when one is shot in the back it is the guy without his back plate.And even then this film could do without all sentimental moments, it is too much, it is like every trick in the book is opened so you, me the viewer will feel even more with these poor americans.

Many of the films contain a stereotypical premise The jock\/hunk, the big-breasted blonde everyone wants, the token ethic kid, the nerdy boy\/girl, etc.  Many of the teen flicks produced in recent years have capitalized onthis formula.  for some reason though, She's All That, while containing some of these elements, works.Zach Siler (Freddie Prinze Jr., in his breakthrough role) is a guy that has guys wanting to be him, and girls wanting to nail him  He's rich, smart, athletic, has a popular girlfriend, and is student body president. Everything is going great for Zach, although he hasn't chosen a college yet. The film begins when Harrison High School is gearing back up again after spring break.  Zach is looking for girlfriend Taylor Vaughn (Jodi Lynn O'Keefe), who is no where to be found.  All of a sudden, she breezes into his prescence--with a tatoo, no less--and dumps Zach.  It so happens that she has fallen for Brock Hudson, the dyslexic volleyball player (who is also fictional) from The Real World (played brilliantly by Matthew Lillard) that was ultimately kicked out of the house.  Zach makes a bet with friends Dean (Paul Walker) and Preston (Dule Hill) that he can make over any girl and make her the Prom Queen in six weeks.  The lucky girl is none other than Laney Boggs (Rachel Leigh Cook), a misfit art student.  Zach slowly wins over her trust, and begins to show her a good time.  Laney, who put up a wall to avoid all of the popular kids, begins to trust Zach. When Zach begins to fall for Laney, he has to remember that this was all a bet. What will he do?I wasn't all for seeing She's All That originally.  I saw this film in January 1999 after a grueling week of high school midterms (I was a sophomore) as a means to hang out with my friends.  I didn't know who Freddie Prinze Jr. was, and had unknowlingly seen him in I Know What You Did Last Summer the year before.  After seeing this film,  I fell in love with the lanky dark-haired teen heartthrob that girls have lusted over for several years now right then and there, and have liked him ever since. Since I am not a teen movie fan (with minor exceptions--I like Breakfast Club, Fast times @ Ridgemont High--my all-time favorite, and Down to You), I wasn't drawn to this film. After seeing it though, I pushed past that conception to allow this to be a treasured film.  The acting in it is decent, and each character pulls his or her weight.  I have to admit that while Zach is my favorite character in this movie, the scenes that Matthew Lillard did truly stole the show!  Lillard is so funny, and he really acts like a doofus, obviously something he's good at.  I remember Jodi Lynn O'Keefe from Step By Step, but I had never heard of Rachel Leigh Cook (I heard she was in Carpool).My favorite scenes are the opening scene with Taylor dumping Zach and her explanation, which goes into a flashback scene at MTV's spring break celebration, where she meets Brock Hudson (Zach Brock Hudson?!  What kind of a name is Brock Hudson?  Taylor And what kind of a name is Zach? Besides, Brock is from The Real World.  Zach What, like Resceda? Taylor No, The Real World, second season), the Real World nightmare scene, Brock Hudson's crazy dance to Rick James' Give it to Me Baby, the prom with the cool Rockefeller Skank dance, the scene where Laney comes down the stairs before going to the party, the beach scene, and the end (I won't give this away, but its a treat for the ladies!)  My favorite line has to be the one that Taylor says to Zach--You didn't really think I was going off to college and still be dating you, did you?  Oh, you did?. How sweet! and the reversal of this line when Brock was breaking up with Taylor--You didn't think I was going to leave for All Star Road Rules and still be dating you, did you?  Oh, you did.  How sweet!I own the DVD of this movie, and quite frankly, it was worth the $19.99 I paid for it.  This was a great film, and I am disappointed that more people didn't give it a chance. Kudos to those who did, this film was worth watching.  This is a great chick flick or date film that's sure to appeal to both guys and girls.  With a great cast of young talent and a story that sure to invoke plenty of Ohhh, how cute! moments from gushing teenage girls, this is a teen film that is sure to be a favorite for years to come. See this film and find out why it's all that! ","genre":null},{"date":"4 November 2002","score":"","review":"  As I've mentioned in previous reviews, I am not a fan of the teen genre.

Many of the films contain a stereotypical premise The jock\/hunk, the big-breasted blonde everyone wants, the token ethic kid, the nerdy boy\/girl, etc.  Many of the teen flicks produced in recent years have capitalized onthis formula.  for some reason though, She's All That, while containing some of these elements, works.Zach Siler (Freddie Prinze Jr., in his breakthrough role) is a guy that has guys wanting to be him, and girls wanting to nail him  He's rich, smart, athletic, has a popular girlfriend, and is student body president. Everything is going great for Zach, although he hasn't chosen a college yet. The film begins when Harrison High School is gearing back up again after spring break.  Zach is looking for girlfriend Taylor Vaughn (Jodi Lynn O'Keefe), who is no where to be found.  All of a sudden, she breezes into his prescence--with a tatoo, no less--and dumps Zach.  It so happens that she has fallen for Brock Hudson, the dyslexic volleyball player (who is also fictional) from The Real World (played brilliantly by Matthew Lillard) that was ultimately kicked out of the house.  Zach makes a bet with friends Dean (Paul Walker) and Preston (Dule Hill) that he can make over any girl and make her the Prom Queen in six weeks.  The lucky girl is none other than Laney Boggs (Rachel Leigh Cook), a misfit art student.  Zach slowly wins over her trust, and begins to show her a good time.  Laney, who put up a wall to avoid all of the popular kids, begins to trust Zach. When Zach begins to fall for Laney, he has to remember that this was all a bet. What will he do?I wasn't all for seeing She's All That originally.  I saw this film in January 1999 after a grueling week of high school midterms (I was a sophomore) as a means to hang out with my friends.  I didn't know who Freddie Prinze Jr. was, and had unknowlingly seen him in I Know What You Did Last Summer the year before.  After seeing this film,  I fell in love with the lanky dark-haired teen heartthrob that girls have lusted over for several years now right then and there, and have liked him ever since. Since I am not a teen movie fan (with minor exceptions--I like Breakfast Club, Fast times @ Ridgemont High--my all-time favorite, and Down to You), I wasn't drawn to this film. After seeing it though, I pushed past that conception to allow this to be a treasured film.  The acting in it is decent, and each character pulls his or her weight.  I have to admit that while Zach is my favorite character in this movie, the scenes that Matthew Lillard did truly stole the show!  Lillard is so funny, and he really acts like a doofus, obviously something he's good at.  I remember Jodi Lynn O'Keefe from Step By Step, but I had never heard of Rachel Leigh Cook (I heard she was in Carpool).My favorite scenes are the opening scene with Taylor dumping Zach and her explanation, which goes into a flashback scene at MTV's spring break celebration, where she meets Brock Hudson (Zach Brock Hudson?!

I have never seen it since, because the VHS was late and limited, and there was no DVD until now. Anyway--- upon watching the new DVD anniversary edition, I was re-charmed and re-enrolled in the Steven Speilberg fan club (so to speak). Wow!I watched the entire restored version, waiting for the new effects. i never saw them. It looked like the E.T. movie I had remembered. It was bright, deep, warm, engaging, and utterly cool. It was only upon watching the marvelous commentary portions on Disk Two that I got my answers, as to where the new stuff was. Speilberg does a shot-by-shot explanation of the enhancements. Nothing new in the sense of added stuff--- by what looked great as sci-fi FX back in 1982 really DID look a bit stupid today.

It uses the Pinocchio story as a template and elements from Brian Aldis' bleak short-story to drive the plot.Every scene in the film raises philosophical questions about our increasing reliance on technology and the forms that technology takes. We should also be questioning our emotional reactions to each scene as we watch it. Why do we empathise with David when he is dumped in the woods, why do we empathise with Teddy when he is being taunted, why do we feel the cruelty of David's 'brother' and fear the outcome of his jealousy so intensely? These things are just machines - why should we care?The most striking moments are when the machines empathise (or would SYMpathise be more appropriate?) with each other, at the flesh-fair, Gigolo Joe helping David, Teddy protecting David...It doesn't fail to send shivers down my spine when Gigolo Joe proclaims 'They made us too good to quick'. These machines are so complex they have evolved emotional responses of their own (or at least the ability to display them as a consequence of their programming). Whether they are 'real' or not these mechanical emotions serve the purpose of ours (which are fairly mechanical themselves - relying on chemical reactions between hormones in our bodies, there is nothing spiritual about adrenaline, testosterone et al) and this provokes a mixture of feelings feelings of dread, awe, guilt - and indeed empathy are provoked by the AI's superb script, acting, direction and cinematography which relates the ideas I am delving into here (and many more) in intelligent and stylish fashion.Empathy has been explored before in a book about the nature of humanity that introduces mechanical (or in this case synthetic) emotions. This book is the famous Do Android's Dream of Electric Sheep (later Bladerunner) by Phillip K Dick and returns with a vengeance in this film to similar but even more devastating effect.The ending of this movie is hotly debated - many misunderstood it utterly - even thinking the robots of the future being depicted were aliens! This ending is utterly chilling - humanity has passed on and the robots are our true 'children'. David is discovered during an archaeological expedition by these new highly advanced robots and appears as an ancient still-functioning relic who holds information of much use to them. The robots only function was to provide joy by receiving love (like a complex Teddy bear). He is put out of his constant 'misery' (or what we would interpret in human terms as misery) by these future-robots when they conjure an illusion of his 'mother' in his mind for him out of some DNA.At this moment we realise that it is a chilling thought that humans could create a being that could feel misery in this way. Requiring the love of one person but never able to get it - even if they wait for many millennia. And then, with an almost-imperceptible jerk of the head, David 'dies' and we remember - this is *just* a machine. We also realise on second viewing that David doesn't blink one for the entire film.I have covered some of the main points of the film in a very slapdash way. I hope that my ragged conveyance of these ideas (especially compared to how they are put across in the film) can convince some people to go back to this movie and experience it as the master-work it truly is.When you see this film remember that this is not Die Hard with robots - you are watching an intelligent and emotionally complex film.

While out Donnie house is struck by an aeroplane engine that crushes his room and would have surely killed him.  Donnie follows Frank's instruction as they grow increasingly violent as he tries to prevent the world ending and turn time back.I, like many others, came to this on the back of rave reviews but I knew that this film is a CULT movie.  That means that not everyone will get it or enjoy it.  I fell within the first category but not within the second.  The plot is a strange mix of high school movie cliché and a weird hallucination (?) that is Donnie's world.  The two sit well together and both work separately.  The high school stuff finds Donnie in a boat many of us have been in &#150; that of a teenager disaffected and misunderstood by everything around him.  On top of this alienation Donnie must cope with the darker world of Frank &#150; a darkness that is brought out really well and is genuinely creepy.This side of the story is the difficult bit.  There are big question marks that surround what is actually going on with Frank and, even after the film has finished it remains unclear and you'll be left wondering `what the heck was that?'  However it is a fantastic ride and you'll be totally sucked into the world of Donnie.  It's not a classic film because of this &#150; too dark for many and maybe too frustrating in it's ambiguous nature for others, but it is one hell of a movie that'll amuse, chill and entertain long after you finish it.The direction is faultless.  Shadowy stairwells cast beautiful shadows and blue skies and picket fences give way to dark visions and destruction.  The use of music is also good &#150; 80's soundtracks may not be a fresh idea but here it is used sparingly and to great effect.  Some is over familiar but in fairness most is well known but gains value from how it is used with the action onscreen.Gyllenhaal is a great lead and brings an immense depth to the film, his laid back approach mixed with the dark haunted looks he can draw upon add to the feelings of both menace and reality.  The rest of the cast are all great and throw up a few faces I wasn't expecting &#150; including Mary McDonnell, Swayze, Barrymore and Noah Wyle from ER.  These aren't distracting and don't take away or add to the film's value simply by their star power.Overall this is well worth a watch.  You won't get it first time but you'll have fun thinking about it and running over the meaning in your mind.  I'm coming to grips with the whole time travel thing but am still questioning my own answers.  Please remember than this is a cult movie that is wearing a multiplex outfit (just like Frank).  Many will find it confusing, challenging and just too plain weird but most will enjoy it even if the meaning is confused and difficult.

These aren't distracting and don't take away or add to the film's value simply by their star power.Overall this is well worth a watch.  You won't get it first time but you'll have fun thinking about it and running over the meaning in your mind.  I'm coming to grips with the whole time travel thing but am still questioning my own answers.  Please remember than this is a cult movie that is wearing a multiplex outfit (just like Frank).  Many will find it confusing, challenging and just too plain weird but most will enjoy it even if the meaning is confused and difficult.

One night a large figure in a rabbit suit (Frank) appears to Donnie and takes him out of his home in order to tell him that in just over 28 days the world will come to an end.  While out Donnie house is struck by an aeroplane engine that crushes his room and would have surely killed him.  Donnie follows Frank's instruction as they grow increasingly violent as he tries to prevent the world ending and turn time back.I, like many others, came to this on the back of rave reviews but I knew that this film is a CULT movie.  That means that not everyone will get it or enjoy it.  I fell within the first category but not within the second.  The plot is a strange mix of high school movie cliché and a weird hallucination (?) that is Donnie's world.  The two sit well together and both work separately.  The high school stuff finds Donnie in a boat many of us have been in &#150; that of a teenager disaffected and misunderstood by everything around him.  On top of this alienation Donnie must cope with the darker world of Frank &#150; a darkness that is brought out really well and is genuinely creepy.This side of the story is the difficult bit.  There are big question marks that surround what is actually going on with Frank and, even after the film has finished it remains unclear and you'll be left wondering `what the heck was that?'  However it is a fantastic ride and you'll be totally sucked into the world of Donnie.  It's not a classic film because of this &#150; too dark for many and maybe too frustrating in it's ambiguous nature for others, but it is one hell of a movie that'll amuse, chill and entertain long after you finish it.The direction is faultless.  Shadowy stairwells cast beautiful shadows and blue skies and picket fences give way to dark visions and destruction.  The use of music is also good &#150; 80's soundtracks may not be a fresh idea but here it is used sparingly and to great effect.
