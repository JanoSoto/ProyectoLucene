If you are, then The Newsies may be the movie for you. If you're an idiot! Personally, I think that the movie was rated appropriately low. The movie's plot is about nine and ten year old boys why deliver papers, but when Joseph Pulitzer (Robert Duvall) raises the price of the Papes, the boys go on strike. They get boys involved from other places around New York City. They all come together in the movie and win. In real life, though, the boys really lost the strike. The Newsies has a lot of singing and dancing. So, if you are not the musical type, do not watch this movie. The songs are not tunes you hear every day, but they are some you will want to hear again. The dancing is okay for a bunch of teenage boys dancing in vests. I think that the dancing could have been more with the songs and not so choreographed. There were two good dance scenes, that both involved Ann- Margret, the dancer. Ann- Margret did an excellent job at captivating the viewer with her great dancing and her electric personality. The actors are some you may not have heard of, but they did a fair job for the experience they have had. The actors acted too much. They tried to do too good of a job so it appeared boring, pointless, and fake. When the writers and directors say that it's a true story, you can believe part of what they say. Some of the events are true, like the newsies went on strike, formed their own paper and more, but like I said they did not win the strike in real life. It was just part of the story to make it like you want movies to be, the fairy tale ending. And they gave you that. I would give this movie a 2 ½ out of 5 stars. Most of the acting and dancing scenes aren't worth watching again. Though the actors as themselves might get your attention, (ladies, you probably know where I am going with that). If you haven't seen it and you like movies about partially real things and history, you might want to watch this film. Overall, however, I would not watch it again.

It's the scene where Dr Moreau ( Marlon Brando ) sits with his animal experiments and tries to justify himself to UN diplomat Edward Douglas played by David Thewlis . The reason the scene stuck in my mind was because Thewlis is best known for his work in British social realism movies so as Douglas points to the animals asking  What the bloody hell's this all about ? What's he supposed to be ?  I couldn't help thinking that Thewlis's performance had jumped out of a Mike Leigh movie . Even more bizarelly when Moreau replies  You expect me to condense seventeen years into seventeen minutes ... Brando plays the part exactly - And I mean exactly - as he did as Col Kurzt in APOCALPSE NOW , and all the time the camera intercuts with Moreau's creatures all of whom are giving embarrassed looks . I thought because this clip was shown out of context that may be the reason it looked so ridiculous but unfortunately after seeing the whole movie I can say this is one of the least ridiculous parts of the movie THE ISLAND OF DR MOREAU isn't as well known as some of HG Well's other books like THE TIME MACHINE or WAR OF THE WORLDS but it deserves to be remembered since it deals with humanism , genetic engineering and vivisection . Obviously these concepts were beyond the productions knowledge and we have a film that makes little sense . It goes without saying everything about the movie is bad , the directing is bad , the screenplay is bad and the acting is bad but the worse thing is the way the producers have tried to update the storyline by having much of the action take place in an acid house ! No seriously in order for it to appeal to a 20 something audience Val Kilmer's character ( Who's not really a character - He's just there to spout lines and be used as a plot device ) decides to have an acid house party with his furry friends . No doubt the animals favourite tune is Panic by The Smiths because they decide to hang the bloody DJ and install a new furrier music maker who then shoots anyone who either appears too sycophantic or too critical to his choice of music . The film ends with Douglas escaping after the animal experiments have killed one another in a shoot out Anyone reading this review without seeing the film will no doubt be phoning an ambulance for me .

But all he has ever done his whole life is assist those in need, never for a second thinking about himself. Wanting to see the world before he sets off to college for an architect degree, he finds that he can't let his town crumble against the miserable, hateful, greedy and powerful 'Potter' and so he decides to stay. His father passes away, and so he must find a way to run the 'Loans' business that his father has kept from the mad man 'Potter'. All goes well for Bailey - a beautiful wife, a few children and a lot of friends. Although still handing out loans like his father before him, he pursues his dream of building and constructs a home village with affordable houses despite Potter's mass influence on the township. Unfortunately for Bailey, things begin to point downhill following the Depression and later bankruptcy where Bailey just can't handle the weight of burden of all the people's money he cannot repay. He comes to the harrowing conclusion that he should never have been born and decides to leave his family and friends and take his own life off a bridge. But the world cannot dispose of itself such a man, so god sends an Angel on a mission to get its wings, or better yet to save George Bailey's life. The Angel shows George what life would have been like had he not been born at all and of what became of the people he took dearly. Miserable under Potter's absolute influence, the town looks like an over indulgent, over spent, money making machine. George gets a glimpse of his own powerful influence on his friends and family and realises just what a wonderful life he really had.Few films have portrayed the value (not the meaning) of life like 'It's a Wonderful Life' has. In contemporary times, we have been fed with recycled stories such as The Family Man and It can happen to you, but none have captured the raw beauty of life like the original, It's a wonderful Life- its success partly due to its simplicity. And it sustains your attention from start to finish due to its simple and riveting storytelling. Sets aren't big, the story is quite small and the film is in black and white. What makes this film stand taller than others is the great dialog between the characters which consistently remains on the story throughout the film and not on irrelevant topics - this is what keeps us glued to the screen (unlike with modern films, most of the dialog is blabber about nothing). The acting is superb from the whole cast, but you have got to hand it to James Stewart for one of the best performances of his career portraying the discouraged George Bailey - arguably his best performance - and one of the best performances you will see in any film. What I really love about this film is the lack of music, which gives a sense of realism to the story, like we are there with the characters in George Bailey's world.Frank Capra creates an unforgettable atmospheric experience that remains tattooed in your memory years after viewing. The outdated effects aside, this film has stood the test of time as a timeless classic. The direction was subtle and superb - rarely equaled and I think this film is best in Black and White, even though they already had color in 1939, seven years before this masterpiece was released.I recommend this film to anybody who feels down and depressed, sad and lonely. It really makes you think about the importance and beauty of this life in which you are living. All I can say is that I will be watching this film yearly until the day that I die due to its poignancy. A real classic in cinema history. It really is a wonderful Life!

Wanting to see the world before he sets off to college for an architect degree, he finds that he can't let his town crumble against the miserable, hateful, greedy and powerful 'Potter' and so he decides to stay. His father passes away, and so he must find a way to run the 'Loans' business that his father has kept from the mad man 'Potter'. All goes well for Bailey - a beautiful wife, a few children and a lot of friends. Although still handing out loans like his father before him, he pursues his dream of building and constructs a home village with affordable houses despite Potter's mass influence on the township. Unfortunately for Bailey, things begin to point downhill following the Depression and later bankruptcy where Bailey just can't handle the weight of burden of all the people's money he cannot repay. He comes to the harrowing conclusion that he should never have been born and decides to leave his family and friends and take his own life off a bridge. But the world cannot dispose of itself such a man, so god sends an Angel on a mission to get its wings, or better yet to save George Bailey's life. The Angel shows George what life would have been like had he not been born at all and of what became of the people he took dearly. Miserable under Potter's absolute influence, the town looks like an over indulgent, over spent, money making machine. George gets a glimpse of his own powerful influence on his friends and family and realises just what a wonderful life he really had.Few films have portrayed the value (not the meaning) of life like 'It's a Wonderful Life' has. In contemporary times, we have been fed with recycled stories such as The Family Man and It can happen to you, but none have captured the raw beauty of life like the original, It's a wonderful Life- its success partly due to its simplicity. And it sustains your attention from start to finish due to its simple and riveting storytelling. Sets aren't big, the story is quite small and the film is in black and white. What makes this film stand taller than others is the great dialog between the characters which consistently remains on the story throughout the film and not on irrelevant topics - this is what keeps us glued to the screen (unlike with modern films, most of the dialog is blabber about nothing). The acting is superb from the whole cast, but you have got to hand it to James Stewart for one of the best performances of his career portraying the discouraged George Bailey - arguably his best performance - and one of the best performances you will see in any film. What I really love about this film is the lack of music, which gives a sense of realism to the story, like we are there with the characters in George Bailey's world.Frank Capra creates an unforgettable atmospheric experience that remains tattooed in your memory years after viewing. The outdated effects aside, this film has stood the test of time as a timeless classic. The direction was subtle and superb - rarely equaled and I think this film is best in Black and White, even though they already had color in 1939, seven years before this masterpiece was released.I recommend this film to anybody who feels down and depressed, sad and lonely. It really makes you think about the importance and beauty of this life in which you are living. All I can say is that I will be watching this film yearly until the day that I die due to its poignancy. A real classic in cinema history. It really is a wonderful Life!

That doesn't excuse it. It's still diabolical (in pretty much every sense of the word).Of course everyone DOES know it's crap.

Of course, the fact that it's carried by the charismatic John Cusack and features the awesome comedy talents of Jack Black doesn't exactly do it any harm either&#133; This film is a very different take on the classic romantic comedy as the humour is very potent, much more so than the easy humour that the genre usually leaves us with.

Many non-Tarantino fans say that Tarantino fans don't like this film because it's central character is a woman, but the simple fact of the matter is that it's simply not as good. Jackie Brown lacks the bite and dynamic genius that epitomised Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, and instead of having a profound influence on cinema, Jackie Brown is more of a continuation of what Tarantino started with his first two features. I am neither a fan nor a hater of Tarantino; up until the Kill Bill travesty, I was a fan; but now I'm not so sure. However, this was made in a time when Tarantino was still cool, and 'cool' is something this movie definitely is. The coolness comes from Tarantino's quick-fire script, relaxed character mannerisms and old style soundtrack. The coolness doesn't do the film any favours whatsoever on the realism, or credibility front, but when you're watching Jackie Brown, you know you're watching a movie; so just sit back, relax and have fun, as Tarantino takes you on a tour of what he loves about cinema.In technical terms, Jackie Brown is Quentin Tarantino's finest hour. This is the most intelligent and mature script he ever wrote (the fact that it was based on someone else's work not withstanding). This is also the film that he reached his directorial peak. Tarantino is good at making cool crime films; he proved it with his first two features, and this film goes a long way to proving it more. Typically, it's a long way from perfect; it's overlong (an interesting prelude to Kill Bill, which was about 2 hours overlong), the character development is cringe-worthy at times and the story gets muddled a little towards the middle; but the good outweighs the bad, and when you've got the likes of Samuel L. Jackson and Robert DeNiro chewing fat over a 'Chicks with Guns' video, you're unlikely to care about the film's problems. As usual, Tarantino razzle-dazzles his audience with his trademark 'great' cast (which really is great by the way) and a soundtrack comprised of songs that used to be hip (and now are again, strangely) and this helps to mask the film's problems also.All in all, Jackie Brown is a lot of fun. Audiences the world over should gather round and thank Tarantino for making this film. This is the sort of film that allows you to lose yourself for a couple of hours and just absorb what you see on screen.

","genre":"Crime, Thriller"},{"date":"10 January 2005","score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Quentin Tarantino's third feature isn't generally as highly rated among fans as his previous two. Many non-Tarantino fans say that Tarantino fans don't like this film because it's central character is a woman, but the simple fact of the matter is that it's simply not as good. Jackie Brown lacks the bite and dynamic genius that epitomised Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, and instead of having a profound influence on cinema, Jackie Brown is more of a continuation of what Tarantino started with his first two features. I am neither a fan nor a hater of Tarantino; up until the Kill Bill travesty, I was a fan; but now I'm not so sure. However, this was made in a time when Tarantino was still cool, and 'cool' is something this movie definitely is. The coolness comes from Tarantino's quick-fire script, relaxed character mannerisms and old style soundtrack. The coolness doesn't do the film any favours whatsoever on the realism, or credibility front, but when you're watching Jackie Brown, you know you're watching a movie; so just sit back, relax and have fun, as Tarantino takes you on a tour of what he loves about cinema.In technical terms, Jackie Brown is Quentin Tarantino's finest hour. This is the most intelligent and mature script he ever wrote (the fact that it was based on someone else's work not withstanding). This is also the film that he reached his directorial peak. Tarantino is good at making cool crime films; he proved it with his first two features, and this film goes a long way to proving it more. Typically, it's a long way from perfect; it's overlong (an interesting prelude to Kill Bill, which was about 2 hours overlong), the character development is cringe-worthy at times and the story gets muddled a little towards the middle; but the good outweighs the bad, and when you've got the likes of Samuel L. Jackson and Robert DeNiro chewing fat over a 'Chicks with Guns' video, you're unlikely to care about the film's problems. As usual, Tarantino razzle-dazzles his audience with his trademark 'great' cast (which really is great by the way) and a soundtrack comprised of songs that used to be hip (and now are again, strangely) and this helps to mask the film's problems also.All in all, Jackie Brown is a lot of fun. Audiences the world over should gather round and thank Tarantino for making this film. This is the sort of film that allows you to lose yourself for a couple of hours and just absorb what you see on screen. Quentin Tarantino may not be the greatest director of all time, but he knows how to entertain and this film is immense in that department. Here's to hoping Tarantino returns to projects he can handle in the near future...

He loves crime and the demeanor of kids in their early stages of understanding society and people around them.In this movie, which is based off the book by Jim Schutze Bully A True Story of High School Revenge, Nick Stahl's creepy role as Bobby Kent (portayed beautifully & gritty at the same time) is matched to Brad Renfro's Marty Puccio, an abused kid who never stops his friend (Kent) from running his actions and life. Because his parents are unwilling to relocate, Marty has to put up with Bobby's actions against him and even values him as a friend of sorts. When two around-the-way girls named Ali and Lisa come into their space (portrayed by Bijou Phillips and Rachel Miner, respectively), the two boys forget their roles of abuser and abusee and transfer their energies into each girl.Lisa becomes Marty's girlfriend, and though the group's closeness, they invite Ali over to sleep with Bobby. Bobby's persona, being already unbalanced and hostile, acts out on him in this particular scene in which he has rough sex with Ali and basically rapes her. So being the rapist and abuser that these kids know him as, they plot to kill him, but they still have their morals to battle with.I won't give away the ending (being that I've spoiled basically half the movie), but the feeling of the entire movie is why you watch this. that and the acting was pretty crazy and believable. I loved seeing Leo Fitzpatrick as the Hit-man in this film (he was in KIDS in his first role, also directed by Clark). I love, also, how Clark was willing to hire another guy (Daniel Franzese) based on the fact that he loved KIDS and knew KIDS verbatim (even though he explains on the DVD that he could actually deliver a line or two). The rape scene was a little tough to get through, but I, personally, have seen worse (buy Irreversible). Also you get really creepy vibes if you've seen KIDS and then watch this because the director loves young-looking nudists in his films. At times, it's artistic, but when you seen Rachel Miner naked for the 10th time in the same film, you start to get the creepy vibes again.Again, Nick Stahl did a fantastic job, as did Brad Renfro (even if his roles are usually of this difficulty...playing a lobotomized friend). Michael Pitt played the doper-friend (I've liked his acting since Finding Forrester) who was a major part in this even though you wouldn't think it would be. I liked the playful role of Heather Swallers, played by a Kelli Garner, who was cast a year later as a huffer girl in Todd Luiso's depressing Love Liza (so you can see the depth that directors cast he as).So go out and buy this if you're into cult movies with great directing and acting. Very stylistic and real.

The problem is the villains Portrayed perfectly in the first two movies, they are now just around for the sake of needing villains. Tommy Lee Jones was not playing Two-Face as much as he was playing a second-rate rip-off of Joker. Nearly all of Nicole Kidman's screen time as Dr Chase Meridian was just cringe-worthy. Jim Carrey was much better at playing The Riddler, even if he was essentially playing an evil version of himself. In fact, he wasn't even that intimidating.

She takes him back to her home. At the same time, fallen angel Gabriel (Christopher Walken) escapes from hell and stalks around LA looking to get back into heaven, killing rival angel Rafael (Glenn Danzig). Danyael escapes and disappears into the LA underworld. Gabriel finds out about Danyael and Valerie and starts to stalk her. Valerie discovers that she is already pregnant with Danyael's child, and starts to go looking for him. Gabriel thinks that the best way to track down Valerie is with a human disciple, and recruits Izzy (Brittany Murphy) to help him. Digging dipper into Danyael's disappearance, she learns that she has stumbled onto an ages old war between the rival factions of God's angels. The child she is pregnant with is to be the person who unites the two warring factions of Heaven. Danyael is able to save her from an attack from Gabriel. Together they go in search of the one person who can fulfill Valerie's fate, Michael (Eric Roberts). Gabriel has also tracked them to Michael's location, and begins to tear it apart looking for Valerie to stop her from delivering the child and ending the war of the angels.The Good News I really enjoy this movie, and I think it is nearly as good as its predecessor. The main improvement over the first one is the heightened gore in the film. There is far more heart ripping in this one than in the first one, which allows for more bloodletting in the time of death than in the other one. We also get to see more gore in the attacks on the two angels in the film. As both are perceived, unknowingly, as a threat to humanity, there are several fine shoot-outs with the police and the two angels. Even Izzy has a few cool gore scenes when she is learning that Gabriel has made her immortal to aid in his search. Being rammed into a wall, impaled by steel rods and even shot several times are all bloody revealed. It was nice to see that after a near-bloodless part 1. Even though it was a little shorter, it never really felt short at all. It always held your attention for the duration, and it keeps enough action coming to entertain anyone.The Bad News Anyone who has even a small amount of religious doctrine will be able to smell the baloney in this movie. It is really so obvious how preposterous this movie is that it almost makes no sense why this is made. A lot of it could be construed as religious at some point, but it does take a lot of construing to believe most of the story. The plot is interesting enough, but a lot of the back-story involved is the main problem.The Final Verdict If you don't have too much of a problem with a lot of religious banter in a movie, this one isn't all that bad.

I purchased this film especially because it carries the reputation of being an absolutely awful 60's production, almost unbearable to sit through. Either my interpretation of awful is completely different from the public opinion or this reputation is unjustified, because I what I saw was a cheap, but nevertheless creative and dared story with above-average acting performances and groundbreaking gory make-up effects (groundbreaking when realizing the year was 1962 and hideous scars as well as poking out eyeballs weren't that common yet). I was expecting to witness really lousy dialogues and ridiculously illogical plot-twists but the script and elaboration of this film pleasantly surprised me for sure. If you can't get passed the cardboard set pieces and weak photography, that's your loss, but it certainly isn't a reason to entirely neglect this film. The story focuses on the overly ambitious surgeon Bill Cortner (decent performance by Jason Evers) who likes to experiment with transplanting limbs, organs and even complete heads! When a car crash he caused decapitates his fiancée, her artificially keeps her alive while searching for a decent (still walking) donor body. The plot is enriched with a horrible monster in the laboratory's closet (a previous experiment of Dr. Cortner that went wrong), a traumatized model and the stubborn head itself that hates not being dead. Granted, The Brain that Wouldn't Die features a couple very boring sequences that lead nowhere. In an overlong sequence set at a nudie bar, for example, Cortner seduces two possible hot body-donors but his attempt is eventually fruitless. This, along with the abrupt ending and fuzzy camera-work, is the only real letdown in an otherwise entertaining and enthusiastically made horror quickie. Experienced horror fans will certainly appreciate the maker's attempts to serve us gore and morbid humor (in a hilarious sequence, Dr. Bill tapes the talking head's mouth shut!). Please, don't let the negative comments and the ranking in the bottom top 100 keep you from watching it. It's an okay movie that you won't regret wasting time with. If you really want an awful film with a more or less similar premise, check out The Frozen Dead (Herbert J. Leder &#150; 1966). Very tedious nonsense in which the experimenting doctors are vicious Nazis and the separated heads are a lot less lively.

I purchased this film especially because it carries the reputation of being an absolutely awful 60's production, almost unbearable to sit through. Either my interpretation of awful is completely different from the public opinion or this reputation is unjustified, because I what I saw was a cheap, but nevertheless creative and dared story with above-average acting performances and groundbreaking gory make-up effects (groundbreaking when realizing the year was 1962 and hideous scars as well as poking out eyeballs weren't that common yet). I was expecting to witness really lousy dialogues and ridiculously illogical plot-twists but the script and elaboration of this film pleasantly surprised me for sure. If you can't get passed the cardboard set pieces and weak photography, that's your loss, but it certainly isn't a reason to entirely neglect this film. The story focuses on the overly ambitious surgeon Bill Cortner (decent performance by Jason Evers) who likes to experiment with transplanting limbs, organs and even complete heads! When a car crash he caused decapitates his fiancée, her artificially keeps her alive while searching for a decent (still walking) donor body. The plot is enriched with a horrible monster in the laboratory's closet (a previous experiment of Dr. Cortner that went wrong), a traumatized model and the stubborn head itself that hates not being dead. Granted, The Brain that Wouldn't Die features a couple very boring sequences that lead nowhere. In an overlong sequence set at a nudie bar, for example, Cortner seduces two possible hot body-donors but his attempt is eventually fruitless. This, along with the abrupt ending and fuzzy camera-work, is the only real letdown in an otherwise entertaining and enthusiastically made horror quickie. Experienced horror fans will certainly appreciate the maker's attempts to serve us gore and morbid humor (in a hilarious sequence, Dr. Bill tapes the talking head's mouth shut!).

For one thing boasting and showing off and for another,power over another is assumed.That is both blatant in its underpinning as well as seductive.The seduction is provided in the scene where the female who is a exotic dancer is preparing to marry Capt.Hillard.She does a seductive zip my dress up with her angel,who is no more than maybe 9 or 10 years old.I think that that kind of suggestion is inappropriate even bordering on improper.Little boys like Little girls are innocent and though it is suggested that the girls grow up faster then boys,it is the boys who are rebellious. That scene is mean as it is suggestive and even provocative because parents should know better and when they do not provide for the child some moral fiber as to conduct they allow for a fast lane idea which allows a deviate basis as to conduct.Though there is more to suggest all I can say that deviant conduct is not about sexual proclivities it is about crime and a problem in society,all stemming from the child's upbringing.This is not a simple idea and neither is what this film is selling.Hollywood is not such that we should know these back-lots and warehouses lest we stumble upon the next academy award.

This is completely undeserved because i rate THE OMEN as one of the best horror movies from the 1970s , if not all time . The book in question makes a big deal of how young Damien's parents experience some ghastly going ons without realising something is seriously wrong , but this is churlish since the audience ( like in most horror movies ) are one step in front of the protagonists , we instantly know what's going on even if the characters on screen don't and this is what makes the narrative so suspenseful , we're waiting for Ambassador Robert Thorn to put two and two together . It should also be pointed out that these types of tradgedies do happen in life and there's a rational explanation with no supernatural causes involvedComparisons with both THE OMEN and THE EXORCIST will be made but this is by much the better film I think . Both films deal with satanic powers and both are very dead pan but unlike THE EXORCIST the serious tone of this movie doesn't go against it , THE EXORCIST goes out of its way to shock the audience while THE OMEN keeps its discipline and is all the better for it . Richard Donner brings shock moments where it's needed like the revelation of the priest after the fire , the scene in the cemetery and the lorry accident at Megiddo and unlike the shock scenes in THE EXORCIST they're never unintentionally funny .
