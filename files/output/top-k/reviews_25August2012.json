I was intrigued by the character, Will Hunting which was well played by Matt Damon. I wanted to find out why he was a troublemaker, why he was scared and every other thing. It was just a good film with a good storyline and an interesting ending.The favourite character choice was a tie between Will Hunting and Sean Maguire played by Matt Damon and Robin Williams respectively. Will Hunting was the main character in the film and the storyline revolved around helping him. It would have been very hard to script Hunting's dialogue as you would have to show him as a very smart man and it was successful as he fired off very detailed negative reasons why he wouldn't do something and it showed who he was and what kind of childhood he had. Hunting was just a man who had a troubled life and didn't know what to do with his enormous talent and needed the guidance of a mature man. This character was one of the most interesting characters that I have watched.I would recommend to mature people who want to watch a unique movie and will be able to understand the whole purpose of this film.This was a creative film that I really enjoyed, It had an all-star cast with Williams, Damon and Affleck and they didn't let me down. The storyline was a unique one and it wasn't exposed to quickly but took it's time which allowed the audience to really let each scene saturate in their mind for a moment longer and it all added to the great film it was.

It's one that should really speak to every kid's imagination and to those who still have a little child hidden somewhere inside of them. And isn't that basically being everybody on this world? I absolutely still have some problems with this movie but I feel that none of this makes this movie any less of a great and fun experience. In essence it's being a very simple and straightforward movie, in which just a whole bunch of random insane and wonderful stuff happens, the moment they step into Willy Wonka's factory. This is a movie that doesn't need to explain anything. It can let things simply happen and it shows that fantasy has no limitations. You could wish whatever you want from and sometimes dreams come true, as happens to little Charlie in this movie.It's a wonderful, imaginative, fantasy movie, that besides is a great looking one. It has wonderful visuals and colors in it and most importantly, it doesn't look fake! It all looks as if it could be part of the real world and it looks as if every machine really works and all the candy is eatable and tastes wonderful as well.It really looks like Gene Wilder had a great time playing his role. He goes all out, without coming across as insane. It probably is a more subtle performance than most people give him credit for. He is a great comedy character, who besides is capable of placing himself in a kid's world and their fantasy. This doesn't feel like a movie written and made by adults for kids but more like one that in fact got made by kids.It's definitely thanks to Roald Dahl's writing, who of course also wrote the book this movie was based on, that this movie comes to life. He manages to put really a lot into the movie its characters and overall atmosphere. It besides provides the movie with some absolutely great dialog and at time it wants to make you rewind the movie, just to check if you really heard things right. But as I said before, it's being still far from a perfect movie, for me. I have always felt and thought that the beginning of the movie goes on for a bit too long and might be a bit too boring, for young kids especially. I also always thought it was strange that the movie never showed what happened to all of the other kids and what happened to Charlie and his family. The ending feels a bit too rushed and also comes far too sudden. There is no real good buildup to it and it might even be a bit confusing to those who aren't familiar with the book.But despite of all these minor issues, this movie remains a perfectly watchable and fun movie to watch for children and those who still are in touch with their inner child, or have a rich imagination.8\/10 http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"25 August 2012","score":"","review":" After all these years, I feel that this movie still hasn't lost any of its charm or power.

The story was largely rushed and truncated- especially the ending. I know things have to be cut to fit it into such a short time frame (less than two hours) but I feel it was just handled clumsily. The first two thirds of the movie were just mediocre, nothing to write home about, but the last part was just a mess. The acting was nothing special either. Those who were good were wasted in their too-small roles. Those who were featured more were not very good. The two words that appear most in my notes are flat and emotionless. It was an all around disappointment, devoid of all of the passion and fire of the book.Fiona Shaw was very good, but was entirely wasted as Mrs. Reed, in her very limited screen time. Gateshead was way too rushed. Anna Paquin is very good as Jane, but the character is even more feisty than in the book. Even though she was near 25, Charlotte Gainsbourg did look the right age for Jane and they did a pretty good job making her look plain. She was way too tall though (with an very long neck) and although she had everything to make a good Jane, she was pretty dull actually. She was even more reserved and quiet than the book Jane, which, given how passionate her younger self was in this, was especially jarring.If I thought Gainsbourg's Jane was lackluster, that was nothing compared to William Hurt's Rochester. My original feelings on him were block of wood and my opinion remains unchanged upon the latest viewing. My above mentioned flat and emotionless apply to him more than anyone or anything else in this film. Not only did he and Jane not have any chemistry (I'm unsure how they even fell in love in this, since they have so few scenes together), he just didn't seem to care at all. He was so dull! The proposal scene was so passionless, and even their kissing looked staged (i.e. their lips did not really touch). He did not show Rochester's brooding\/angry side or the humorous side.

The acting was great, the terror and fear shown by the wife felt real! The twins, the room 237 and the kid really added to the chills in this movie. Great overall movie!

So looking forward to part 2!I loved Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) for he was the Godfather and his wisdom and ways were just brilliantly thought out. His love for his family and ability to keep peace within the Dons was great! Vito had his priorities right and was unfortunate to get shot leaving his sons in charge.The beginning was superb as you got insight to how the Godfather worked and then the events that happened after with the numerous shootings, the loyalty tested, the reluctant son becoming the Godfather and the war between the mobs was just well written and put together. I loved every minute of it! It is an offer you can't refuse!I would recommend it to any adult and young adult that have a love for movies. This movie is a classic and has every reason to be.

It is 128 minutes long. And for 120 of those minutes, I was waiting for something, anything, interesting, unusual, inspirational to happen.I might as well have watched Little House on the Prairie, or The Walton's.CharactersGilbert (played by Johnny Depp) is longing for something more than what he has and what he knows. But he is tied down with helping the local store, looking after his brother Arnie, and taking care of his mother.His sisters are also longing for something more.Arnie (played by Leo DiCap) likes to climb the local water tower and it makes everyone very nervous (which is why he ends up in jail). Later he celebrates his 18th birthday. Something that the doctors said would never happen. Arnie is an adorable special needs kids who can be somewhat of a handful from time to time.Gilbert's mother is a big woman, who used to be beautiful. She finally recognizes that eating lots of fried chicken and cheese curds may possibly lead to obesity. She realizes how big she has become when she goes to rescue Arnie from the local jail where hoards of local folks have gathered to ogle her and take her picture. There are about 30 people waiting outside the jail when she comes out....waiting to see old Widow Grape. Does anyone else think this is pathetic? Your thrill of the day was seeing the fat woman in town? Here's a dollar...go purchase a meaningful life.Gilbert's mom passes away after she successfully walks upstairs for the first time in ages. Although this event is tragic, it ultimately frees the siblings of their commitment to stay at home and care for their mother. They are now free to pursue other beneficial and productive interests. The world is at their fingertips. Will they take that next step? Will they move out of Endora? Will they put forth the effort to improve their sense of self-worth...or will they be content to remain as they are? That is mostly left up to the viewer to decide. Gilbert will almost certainly be the one who will care for Arnie.Plot It's about the lives of a small-town family in any-town USA.Gilbert is banging some other man's wife because she settled and married some bland insurance agent that she wasn't truly in love with (she later admits after he dies that she misses him and she doesn't miss him). That's another way of saying she married the wrong guy. She used him as a safety net. Now that her safety net is gone, she misses him. But that didn't stop her from cheating on him. And she didn't give a sh*t about him while he was alive.Later in the film, Gilbert hits his special needs brother, Arnie because he's being difficult. (Go figure, a special needs kid not understanding the consequences of his actions). Gilbert feels bad about doing this and runs to the local new girl in town, Becky (played by Juliette Lewis). He finds that she has gotten Arnie to go swimming (something that Arnie is fearful of). Shortly thereafter, he confesses his mistake to Becky and all is well in the morning. The whole movie is like this.The best part is the house burning down...Gilbert did not want her mother to be disrespected by airlifting her out of the upstairs (after she dies) because they cannot carry her down the stairs. Good for you, Gilbert. Summary This movie is chalk full of the inconsequential happenings of an any-town family in any-town America. And it is 128 minutes of boredom. Bottom line - many, many people go to movies to see something they CAN'T see in everyday life. They go to movies to learn, to be inspired, to escape. Where I live, I could drive 20 miles in any direction and experience any of the plot points in this film first-hand, and it wouldn't cost me $5 for a ticket. Synopsis -Common events happening to common people.-Uninspiring and dull-The minute I entered the town of Endora, I wanted to leave. I felt the same at the end of my 128-minute journey.Conclusion -Leo gives the performance of a lifetime as Arnie!For that, I kick it up one point.-The material, subjects, and style of this film are purposefully focused on the ordinary. Thus, this film is ordinary. So, it gets an ordinary score. 5\/10.Apologies to my friends who like it. I fail to see the allure. I'd rather have my grandmother take a big stinky dump on my chest.

The victim is a Chicago businessman who was planning to build a factory in Sparta; fearing that his wife will cancel the plans the police are understandably very keen to wrap the case up quickly.The police chief orders his men to search for vagrants and anybody passing through town; one of the first men brought in is the black man on the train. It soon becomes apparent that he isn't guilty; in fact he is Virgil Tibbs, a police officer from Philadelphia&#x85; a homicide expert. This being Mississippi in 1967 Chief Gillespie isn't keen on working with a black man but he comes to realise that he will have to bury his prejudices, shallow his pride and ask for Virgil's help. As the story proceeds; a variety of suspects appear and Virgil's presence soon attracts the attention of bigoted locals who intend to give him a beating or worse.If this film had been made recently it would still have been good but the fact that it was made in 1967 when the Civil Rights struggle was still ongoing makes it particularly important. It isn't just a political film though; it is a good mystery and could even be considered a 'buddy movie' as the racist southern police chief and the black northern detective come to understand each other. Sidney Poitier and Rod Steiger put in career defining performances as Tibbs and Gillespie. There is not much real action but things frequently get very tense as Virgil gets into very dangerous situations with the locals who are clearly bothered by the idea of a black man in a position of authority; especially one who is clearly more intelligent than they are.

Like many bad sequels to good movies, this one here is basically just a remake without any imagination and in the end you're just watching a cheaper, less entertaining version of the 1994 film. THE CROW CITY OF ANGELS is pretty much dead from the word go as there's simply nothing here to get excited about. I think the only reason I didn't rate the movie lower is that while watching the thing you can't help but hope that something exciting will finally happen and you keep hanging in there hoping for it but in the end it never comes. The entire look of the film just seems like a weak copy of the first and there's no question that this contains a real lack of energy, excitement or simply any characters to root for. I say that because it's hard not to root for anyone who has had their family slaughtered, that's a given, but the problem here is that the film simply doesn't make us care for Ashe or his family. Even the villains here are all forgettable with the exception of Iggy Pop who goes all out with his funny, over-the-top performance. Perez is pretty bland in the lead role. It seems he was going for the same type of laid back approach that Brandon Lee did but it just doesn't work here. Bringing the Sarah character back from the previous film also doesn't work here. The action scenes are all rather boring and I'd say that the majority of them lack any real imagination.

Her Oscar for Monster's Ball is probably based more on her looks then her acting ability. Here, she is the widow of an executed murderer, Lawrence Musgrave(Sean Combs). His executioner is Hank Grotowski(Billy Bob Thornton), a racist guard whose father and son are both red necks, who don't think much of black people.

He's no Dolph Lundgren (who played the bad guy in the first one), but his acting here is probably as good as it's ever going to get. He's pretty much the only person is the cast who delivers his lines with any kind of zest, I'd say he's the best actor in this movie if that wasn't such an amazingly depressing thing to write. The action lacks visual flair, but it's pretty competently done and does keep you entertained for a while. It's not surprising first(and last)-time director Mic Rodgers is actually a stuntman, because that's what the movie essentially is a bunch of stunts. The writers try to give the thing some depth with a family storyline and the worst comic relief character of all time but who cares, let's light more stuff on fire!

About half with strong praise, the other half with disdain. Perhaps part of that is how you look at the military. I honor the sacrifices of our soldiers and the many necessary military campaigns that our country has undertaken, and my father was military, but I'm not quite the fan that John Ford obviously was. But on the other hand, a few years ago I took a tour of West Point, and I was very impressed, so it was a pleasure seeing this film, much of which was filmed at West Point. It lent a sense of realism to the film.However, if you're expecting a great war story here, you're going to be disappointed. That's not what this is about...although with John Ford as director, what you get is rather surprising -- a rather sentimental tale of a handful of people around which West Point functioned. They weren't the heroes, so this is not about that. This is a simple story which is more about immigrants fitting into a new culture...and a rather odd culture, at that.Perhaps the biggest criticism of this film is that Tyrone Power was about 20 years too old for the role...and it shows. That being said, it's a fine performance, and all the better that it's so atypical of what we expect of Tyrone Power. He clearly did some of his own stunts here, which made me think of his fatal heart attack just 3 years later.The other actors here do what's expected of them. Maureen O'Hara is bright and bossy as ever...if anything, perhaps slightly overplayed. Donald Crisp plays Tyrone Power's father (you'll enjoy seeing him do the jig), Ward Bond plays a Captain, and the rarely seen Betsy Palmer has a small role. John Wayne's son Patrick also has a small role, interesting because his dad was who director John Ford wanted for the lead role here. However, it would have been a very different film had Wayne played the role. The ill-fated Robert Francis (memorable from The Caine Mutiny) has a decent role here; gone too soon.John Ford does an excellent job here of portraying love of country and love of culture, although before you're halfway through the film, you're liable to be just a tad bit tired of the emphasis on the Irish. Yet, that's the way it was back then. And, my respect for Ford has grown as a result of watching this film. It's not a western, nor a war flick (even though it was about a military academy), and you can't help but get choked up several times during the film.Highly recommended.

But it's not until he's brought back to life and into the world of playing basketball when he runs into some very looney characters. These individuals are none other than the Looney Tunes characters. The Tunes' problem is that they've been challenged by a group of aliens who call themselves The Monstars to a game of basketball and if they lose, they surrender their freedom to becoming main attractions to a lousy theme park known as Moron Mountain.The owner of Moron Mountain is Swackhammer played by Danny DeVito, who oddly enough sounds a lot like Phil from Disney's Hercules (1997). Unfortunately, the rest of the voice actors who play the Looney Tunes characters are not performed by Mel Blanc or by his son. That's just one of two problems I have with this film.

It had great adventures and wrapped up beautifully but it may have been a bit too long. Regardless, it was very good to watch this movie and I am glad I did, Clint Eastwood was amazing in his prime!I loved Tuco, played by Eli Wallah, who was just one of those loud mouthed idiots that always talks himself into trouble. You can assume that he was the 'UGLY' in the movie. Tuco was just great for the humor side of the film and that's why I loved him. He was also quite unpredictable, you never know what was going to happen with him.I would recommend it to movie buffs who have a love for movies like I do. People who enjoy browsing the history of movies and how they were made back then, especially as it is an iconic one for its time and considered a classic now!It was a unique movie, Clint Eastwood was like WOW! I now understand why he is such a legend in Hollywood. It is definitely one that will last through the ages as it is a classic due to the storyline, the actors and the camera techniques. One thing that put me off was the music! But that was the usual back in those times.
