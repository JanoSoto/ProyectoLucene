This is a demented and frightening motion picture, and that's the bottom line.FBI trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is assigned to do a psychological profile of a notorious serial killer, the brilliant and insane former psychologist, Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins). Her boss, Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) hopes that Lecter will be attracted to Starling's innocence, and help them catch a new serial killer, dubbed Buffalo Bill. But Lecter won't do this for free, and the question becomes whether Starling is able to hold herself together against the evil doctor.This film works as well as it does because it is crafted so well. Had the direction and the acting been pedestrian, this would be just another movie. However, Director Jonathan Demme is interested in exploring his characters and inviting us into the minds of these characters. People call this a horror movie, and that's not true. This is a psychological thriller in its purest form, and the violence and fear that the film generates is due to this exploration. To do this, Demme uses a lot of close-ups so that we can study their facial features, which allows us to understand their emotions on a physical level. This is applying to our basic instincts, and it works; it allows us a deeper understanding of the characters.However, Demme's skill only goes so far; it's up to the actor's to take up the rest of the slack. And the performances by its two stars make a rather unique story into a legendary excursion into fear.Everyone knows his name. Hannibal Lecter, or more by his nickname, Hannibal the Cannibal. Lecter is the personification of evil, and there is no character more frightening than the chilling psychopath played by Anthony Hopkins. Hopkins uses his eyes (he seldom blinks) and his voice to chill us to the very bone. When he walks, it's slow and methodical. Being inside a caged cell does not stop him from looking at the person outside (which from the camera position, is usually us) feel like we are being stalked by a predator. Surprisingly, in this film, Lector is only on screen for 16 minutes, yet the impact of his performance is permanent. Few performances have been more justly rewarded than Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter.His counterpart, Clarice Starling, is portrayed by Jodie Foster, who it seems doesn't know how to give a bad performance. Foster is brilliant as the spunky trainee. She's in over her head, but her determination to solve the case and keep her psyche in one piece makes her a perfect match for Lecter, something they both realize. Although Hopkins gets all the credit, Foster's brilliant performance makes him even better than Hopkins could by himself. Both of their performances compliment each other well, which elevates the project from solid into brilliant. The other actors are effective, but Foster and Hopkins are the ones that really make the film what it is.This isn't a flawless movie; quite frankly, it's just not as frightening as its legend suggests, and the psychological explorations of the characters by critics and the actors make the film promise something that it doesn't have. This is simply a superbly executed thriller, one that relies on character to succeed instead of special effects.Nevertheless, this film will scare you (the climax is genuinely terrifying). And it introduces us (to the definitive interpretation at least...Brian Cox played the role in Manhunter in the 80s) to one of cinema's most notorious characters. That alone is reason enough to see this film.

As you see I'm not a horror's fan, but the glossy image, the 80s's feel, and the 80s's beauties just allured me. And I watched part 1 as well.In some point this movie looks like a good mix of (After Hours) bourgeoisie living a nightmare in one night and (Gremlins 2  The New Batch) evil creatures attack innocent people in one building. But it didn't make a point out of the built of its world; as if the mirrors got the real desires of the characters, or that new sophisticated building is evil, or anything of that sort whatsoever. It's all about accepting another kid to the family, yet shown weakly. And it didn't deal finely with the factors of horror that a situation of haunted skyscraper could produce. Simply that atmosphere could have been more creative and any deep but the movie selected not. So the substance, and the horror, fitted just a poor B movie.It has many naive moments; for instance that doctor assumed too much, the wife saw a false image of her husband in the bedroom's mirror and didn't bother, the totally unexplained power of the medium's necklace, and surely the endless repeating of CAROL ANNE, CAROL ANNE; I thought they were 50 times, but I found lately someone on youtube who counted them accurately; it's 121 times! Nevertheless nothing can outclass the naivety of the end where everything got solved by kidnapping the medium (??). And when you recall that the daughter's boyfriend didn't come back eventually, you've got to begin laughing (for me I laughed gladly. He was that SILLY !).Some matters weren't used well, as the alternative copies of the youth. Some sequences were absurd like the one of the garage which seemed fabricated just for showing an explosion anyway. And the electronic music annoyed me highly. On the other side, it's more coherent than its original. Although the first one is more scary, but it has at least 3 different subjects thrown together into a haunted house situation, alleging being profound while it's too scattered, without one final meaning! True the script and the direction made an average mission, but I prefer their work more than any of the flood of the B horror movies in the 2000s. I liked intensifying the whole events in less than 24 hours, taking place in just one building. The kid Heather O'Rourke gave a good acting, actually the whole cast did a good job. The tricks of the mirrors were done perfectly (you'll ask all the time how they did it?!), being big part of the enjoyment that movie could provide.Speaking about enjoyment, I got the biggest one out of watching Nancy Allen and Lara Flynn Boyle. There is something vivid, innocent and hot about the 80s's women and girls. I don't know but nearly all of them were magically gorgeous. They both looked no less than that. While Boyle, in her film debut, suffered a little bit of heavy make-up, Allen was so damn sexy, even by a simple look from her eyes! I may watch it again only due to these 2 beautiful babies, and the nostalgic feel to the 1980s too (which makes me ask; what ever happened to the female actresses, rather the females, of today??!). Finally, (Poltergeist 3) is a small harmless movie. If there is something horrific more than that badly made ending, it's then the channel that aired the movie; it cut its kisses out. Now this is pure horror for me! ","genre":null},{"date":"2 April 2010","score":"","review":" This is a nice horror movie.

Sorry, that's not just the case. The story wasn't that appealing as Matrix was. The real life sequences were far more interesting than the whole visual effects side, that got overlong, boring, and nowadays dated.

At least, I know it's going to be because Lisberger is not directing the movie, but his hands are in the screenplay again so let's hope he makes something good this time. 2\/10 ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"2 April 2010","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Sergio Leone is one of the greatest directors of all time that does need to be repeated, because it has been known now for decades. When it comes down too which of his films is the best. I would normally say The Good The Bad And The Ugly is his best film. But his best western is no doubt Once Upon A Time In The West. The film opens with a man with no name, but he's often called in this film Harmonica. Charles Bronson one of the toughest true men to ever grace Hollywood pictures plays harmonica. He actually doesn't speak as often as you would think, but I personally think that's his style. Always quiet, with that serious look on his face. Opposite Charles Bronson is Jason Robarts as Cheyenne. I love his personality. He just has a fun time messing with people especially Harmonica never taking him seriously, but as the film continues on, his relationship with Harmonica improves, and he even saves his life, In one of the best train scenes ever captured on film. But my personal favorite is Henry Fonda as Frank the main villain of the film. Frank is ruthless; he doesn't care about anyone except himself. He also hates Harmonica, he has the opportunity to kill him many times through out the film but he doesn't, Frank always keeps you guessing. And in turn Harmonica even saves his life. The final scene is one of the most epic scenes ever. Harmonica and Frank stand off against one another. I don't have a lot of time to mention much more of the cast but I will say they are all perfect. The soundtrack is also fantastic, but you can be the judge of that for yourself. Just to sum it up, with an amazing cast, beautiful soundtrack, and a great director, this is my pick for the greatest western of all time.

(Shock, horror, Nixon was right all along!) and the crisis-torn 70s, when all those nasty hippies were now drug-addicted Aids carriers that caused American Interventionism and God-given etc, etc.You get the point. The issues raised in the movie were far more complex than the mindset on display here, with good and bad on both sides of the argument. America is a wonderful country with wonderful people, but it can't feel good about itself so the film-makers just rewrite history so it CAN feel good about itself. It takes more than a movie of course but apparently people want to be convinced that Interventionism is not such a bad idea; still working well, isn't it? Gump's a decent guy, of course. He isn't judgemental for one thing. Perhaps if we were all afflicted with similar IQs no one would question anything, and American Interventionsm etc etc....I liked Gary Sinise's performance as the war veteran amputee, just another decent guy who has every reason to feel bitter. Pity the movie then has his character rounding on the left-wing draft dodgers and hippie protesters who didn't go to Vietnam, but tried to stop the conflict; perhaps he would better off rounding on the people who sent him there in the first place???This is a great movie for reactionaries.
