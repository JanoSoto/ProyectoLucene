It is a spectacular spoof rife with laughs, sight gags, and silly one-liners that is a good, clean, funny time at the movies. Apparently, Spaceballs are an alien race that foolishly squandered their atmosphere. They desire the one of Druidia. In order to get the combination to their air shield, Spaceballs plan to capture Princess Vespa (Daphne Zuniga) and hold her ransom for the combination. Leading this nefarious plot is Dark Helmet (Rick Moranis), Colonel Sanders (George Wyner), and President Skroob (Mel Brooks). However, King Roland (Dick Van Patten) calls for the help of Lone Star (Bill Pullman) and Barf (John Candy). The plot is ancillary to the laughs, romps, and good times prominent in Mel Brooks parodies. While he relies on corny one-liners we can see a mile away, he also likes to use the long-running gags that also come off well. One great joke is Dark Helmet, the parody of Darth Vader. The irony, though, is Moranis' short, unimposing stature. Even better is the long-running gag of Barf, Lone Star's half-man, half dog sidekick. What works here is the allusion to Chewabacca, which was really a guard dog for Han Solo. What also works are the great comedic interludes and other stabs at sci-fi movies the ridiculously large, long spaceship, the lights that serve no purpose, the ridiculous and ludicrous speeds that can be attained, and the silly notions of beaming someone to another location, although it's just across the room. You also have interesting characters that are their own amidst their own story. While the main focus is the Star Wars movies, there are also great lampoons and tips of the hats to all the great sci-fi television shows and movies ranging from Star Trek, Planet of the Apes, Alien, and even a tip of the hat to Lost in Space. I will say that Spaceballs does not trump his greatest achievements (The Producers, Young Frankenstein, Blazing Saddles), but it definitely is good caliber comedy.

The movie uses stock Pakula trademarks of static shots of scenes or objects from unusual angles, often in semi-darkness, drawing in the viewer to the seedy world New York prostitutes inhabit and at the same time heightening the related sense of discomfort, anxiety, indeed paranoia which the stalker here conveys. A similar methodology was used successfully in the modern French classic Cache which I thoroughly recommend. The film wraps up with a violent death solving the less important whodunnit question but more relevantly runs onto an ambiguous sort of spiritual redemption for Fonda's Bree Daniels character. It's no more than she deserves. Fonda is terrific in the lead, wholly deserving of her Oscar plaudits, in character from the start and conveying her character's at times savvy, at times neurotic traits. She seems to be in almost every scene, her voice a constant atmospheric, accentuated by the constantly replayed tape recording of her getting into character for a client (Nothing is wrong...).Sutherland has less to do as the stoic, unfeeling straight who despite himself finds himself drawn to at first protect and then in fact fall for Fonda's character. He would get more to do (and do it well) as a protector-figure in Roeg's brilliant Don't Look Now which followed a year or two later. That said, there's genuine chemistry in their scenes together. After a first cold, sexual liaison born of Fonda's high anxiety under duress, there's telling subtlety at work as we see them coming together naturally as the film progresses, as seen in the almost silent scenes where he sits her down and bows her head at the site of her ransacked apartment and the surprisingly tender scene where he buys her fruit at a street market, to her great bemusement. The rest of the support is generally fine, including Roy Scheider in an early role as Fonda's sometime pimp.Mention should be made too of Gordon Willis' muted cinematography, all dark greys and browns, even when on location in the streets of NYC - no sunlit exteriors here and also an excellent soundtrack, the surveillance scenes in particular heightened by a keyboard motif which falls on the ears like sharpened icicles.In the end though it's Pakula's directorial vision which imposes the necessary sense of ugly realism, distasteful as it is, in the seamy underworld of a big city in which the characters here play out their murky, seedy other-existences, they hope, in private.

The only foreseeable goal for these immortals is to do battle with one another until only one is left standing to be rewarded with a prize. The prize, though, doesn't seem half as important as tough-guy posturing and intense swordplay. Like zombies, these immortals can only be killed by head-injuries (specifically, decapitation) and ancient swords are their weapon of choice, as they do battle through the ages, altering the course of history, in some instances.What Highlander has that makes it a classic is that it is a simple fantasy story that stands the test of time, even if the film itself looks a bit dated. A lay-man's fantasy, if you will. With it's ground-breaking style (thanks to MTV-bred Mulcahy) and outlandish settings, it's pure, one-hundred-percent escapism. While the direction is unique for it's time, acting-wise, it's a mixed bag. Christopher Lambert hams it up as the titular character, but it is Sean Connery who steals the show -- if only so briefly -- providing what little comic relief there is to be found, as well as a touch of class. The story itself is pretty linear, and if there's one fatal flaw to the whole thing, it's that it is far too drawn out.While the script may skimp on the narrative and clichés are abundant, you can't help but love Highlander anyways. Afterall, if you don't love sword-play set in the streets of New York to the tune of some classic Queen, I don't know that you even have the ability to enjoy movies in the first place. A movie like this is best when not taken seriously. It's fun, quirky, stylish and engaging. Everything a fantasy should be. See it if not for it's nostalgic value, but just to understand the giant pop-culture punchline it has become.

The same technique of forgetting what you were doing thirty seconds after you begin doing it, and perpetually restarting from scratch seems to be the operating technique here. Except that it applies not to the characters in the film, but to the writer and director, Harold Ramis.Caddyshack is a series of sketches that claim to be a movie, but are really far less than the sum of their parts. There are a few good comedy bits &#150; surprisingly, Chevy Chase is good in an understated way that is cumulatively funnier as time goes by &#150; and Rodney Dangerfield brings the frenetic quality and smart-alecky trademark schtick up front and center that is occasionally pretty good.But the whole film never gets going. Now, I'm not someone who thinks that you have to have a John Sayles plot in a comedy. I'm fine with any amount of utterly improbable nonsense if it moves the comedy along. But that doesn't happen here. Stars are perpetually arriving, doing their little set piece, and then disappearing so much so that I found myself saying, it sure was funnier when ----------- was on screen &#150; say, whatever happened to them anyway? about a dozen times. Then, at some point with no relation to anything, they'd appear in a different scene and the process would repeat.Part of the problem is that it's a damned GOLF MOVIE. What the hell? A movie aimed at the Animal House crowd about GOLF??? And the problem there is that there's no template to lampoon. Airplane! is, without a doubt, the funniest film in the last 40 years, mostly because it took the mickey out of all those turgid Airport movies that preceded it, and the whole disaster movie thing. It meant that the jokes could be quick, ceaseless and merciless, and it meant that you kept missing jokes because you were almost crying with laughter from the previous one.In Caddyshack, the whole thing is endless setups for a single lame joke. Ramis does try the parody thing with a little incident in a swimming pool that references Jaws, but it takes five minutes to get through, and the joke has come and gone way before the punchline, which is then totally anticlimactic.Probably the best way and reason to watch Caddyshack, apart from ninja training to learn to overcome suffering silently, is as a perspective on Groundhog Day, which is the SECOND funniest movie in the last 40 years, and for reasons that are entirely due to its own genius. It brings together three elements from Caddyshack Ramis, again as writer producer; a groundhog; and Bill Murray, who, if you want to see evidence of progress of a great comedian, you need do no more than compare these two films, made 13 years apart.In Caddyshack, Murray is a kind of template for what Jim Carrey started out as a Jerry Lewis style goof that get laughs from, well, people who think Jerry Lewis is a genius, and gags that depend on what one can only call a retard persona, which is not funny. All three of these comedians managed to demonstrate at some point in their career that there was some brilliance and control in their comedy, and got way, way better results out of it Murray in many films, especially Groundhog Day, Lost in Translation, and Broken Flowers; Carrey in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Truman Story and a few others; and Lewis in The King of Comedy &#150; in its own way the THIRD funniest movie in the last 40 years.

Stars are perpetually arriving, doing their little set piece, and then disappearing so much so that I found myself saying, it sure was funnier when ----------- was on screen &#150; say, whatever happened to them anyway? about a dozen times. Then, at some point with no relation to anything, they'd appear in a different scene and the process would repeat.Part of the problem is that it's a damned GOLF MOVIE. What the hell? A movie aimed at the Animal House crowd about GOLF??? And the problem there is that there's no template to lampoon. Airplane! is, without a doubt, the funniest film in the last 40 years, mostly because it took the mickey out of all those turgid Airport movies that preceded it, and the whole disaster movie thing. It meant that the jokes could be quick, ceaseless and merciless, and it meant that you kept missing jokes because you were almost crying with laughter from the previous one.In Caddyshack, the whole thing is endless setups for a single lame joke. Ramis does try the parody thing with a little incident in a swimming pool that references Jaws, but it takes five minutes to get through, and the joke has come and gone way before the punchline, which is then totally anticlimactic.Probably the best way and reason to watch Caddyshack, apart from ninja training to learn to overcome suffering silently, is as a perspective on Groundhog Day, which is the SECOND funniest movie in the last 40 years, and for reasons that are entirely due to its own genius. It brings together three elements from Caddyshack Ramis, again as writer producer; a groundhog; and Bill Murray, who, if you want to see evidence of progress of a great comedian, you need do no more than compare these two films, made 13 years apart.In Caddyshack, Murray is a kind of template for what Jim Carrey started out as a Jerry Lewis style goof that get laughs from, well, people who think Jerry Lewis is a genius, and gags that depend on what one can only call a retard persona, which is not funny. All three of these comedians managed to demonstrate at some point in their career that there was some brilliance and control in their comedy, and got way, way better results out of it Murray in many films, especially Groundhog Day, Lost in Translation, and Broken Flowers; Carrey in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Truman Story and a few others; and Lewis in The King of Comedy &#150; in its own way the THIRD funniest movie in the last 40 years. Somehow the effect of each of these was to make everything they'd done earlier all the more intolerable.

Her ex-husband is far more involved in his own pursuits than concern for his son. I suspect that Melanie is getting little financial support from a musician who works only intermittently. The blues really hit home when you get to the late hours and the distractions of earning a living are on temporary hold. It gets really hard not to dump on the absent spouse to preserve a child's relationship to the missing parent.Jack Taylor (George Clooney) lives in a wreck of an apartment that he has no ambition to repair. He has custody of his daughter every other weekend and he is able to get back at his ex-wife by forcing her to leave her daughter in a environment that totally offends her sense of order without being so ramshackle that she can get the courts to intervene. Lots of childish bickering between the parents accompany every custody weekend. Total realism in that scene where the daughter Maggie (Mae Whitman) is dropped off.Melanie is a woman who has been forced to become much more forceful than her nature would prefer. She has enrolled her son Sammy (Alex D. Linz) in a prestigious private school rather than the far inferior public school. That schooling demands the income of a professional woman. She must function in a competitive professional environment. She cannot afford to allow sentiment to hinder her career if she is to provide for her son. But her career is balanced on a knife edge. When Sammy and Maggie miss their school's field trip, due to Jack's cavalier attitude toward the school schedule, the children wind up complicating their parent's already hectic schedule.Jack Taylor definitely has some childlike qualities that both intrigue and annoy Melanie.

However, that position wouldn't be fully cemented until the arrival of Terminator 2 in 1991 which forever raised the bar for the action genre. But plain and simple, Predator is a staple for Schwarzenegger's profile. It introduced the ultra cool Predator to the world and changed the popular culture's perspectives on alien movies. But the movie itself isn't just known for the central character, like the crappy Friday the 13th movies that are only known for the murderous Jason Voorhees and his stupid hockey mask. But Predator is known for the movie as a whole, with a great simplistic plot, awesome characters and great action that will make people want to see this again and again.The movie is a about a former soldier\/mercenary named Dutch (Arnie) who has been involved in a lot of conflict and has since decided to settle down and be the leader of a rescue team. He goes to a South American country to participate in a mission that would supposedly rescue a Cabinet Minister and a few other hostages, but later on he finds out that he's been set up and it was actually a mission to destroy a rebel base that would've invaded sooner or later. And Dutch gets ticked off and he and his team try to escape the jungle, but they're then being pursued by an alien who hunts rather than kills. As the situation escalates, Dutch starts to lose his sanity and that's totally evident in the final showdown with the creature.Like James Cameron's Aliens that came out the year before, Predator is shaped by it's excellent characters, Dutch is the great, silent leader who is somewhat broken inside from all the combat that he went through in the past and his quote If it bleeds, we can kill it is among the greatest. Blain is the totally cool tobacco-chewing, mini-gun-totting guy who spewed out 2 of the movie's best lines I ain't got time to bleed, and This stuff'll make you a goddamn sexual tyrannosaurus, just like me. Mac is pretty much Blain's best bud and frequently shaves with his razor and without the shaving cream to show his manliness. Hawkins is the super-nerd of the group who reads comic books and occasionally makes some sick jokes about his girlfriend. Billy is the silent, no-nonsense spiritual dude. Dillon is the dirty CIA agent who was best pals with Dutch a few years back and then sets up Dutch and his team, which leads to their demise and his, as well. And finally, Poncho is the sympathetic, yet sarcastic soldier who connects with Anna, their hostage, during the course of the film. And these guys are great characters; and they each have their own personalities, which makes you want to see more out of each guy.And of course, I can't forget about the Predator. The high-tech alien that hunts other creatures for sport was a very creative and original idea. It also held a very intimidating presence and the special effects were very well done, especially the camouflage. And I'm still wondering how that managed to do that in 1987.And last, but not the least, the action really stands out thanks to the direction of John McTiernan, who directed this right before he made Die Hard. The scene when the team attacks the rebel camp is, without a doubt one of the best in cinema, since it shows each team member providing something in the attack, and it's not just one guy who acts like a one-man army and destroys everything in his path all by himself. Also, Dutch's confrontation with the predator at the end, which displays more prehistoric styles of combat with the setting of the boulder and spike traps. And this movie makes up the modern warfare action and the caveman action so well.Any action\/sci-fi junkie should watch this, and they will be HOOKED. And you will want to see this again and again.

Also, Dutch's confrontation with the predator at the end, which displays more prehistoric styles of combat with the setting of the boulder and spike traps.

However, that position wouldn't be fully cemented until the arrival of Terminator 2 in 1991 which forever raised the bar for the action genre. But plain and simple, Predator is a staple for Schwarzenegger's profile. It introduced the ultra cool Predator to the world and changed the popular culture's perspectives on alien movies. But the movie itself isn't just known for the central character, like the crappy Friday the 13th movies that are only known for the murderous Jason Voorhees and his stupid hockey mask. But Predator is known for the movie as a whole, with a great simplistic plot, awesome characters and great action that will make people want to see this again and again.The movie is a about a former soldier\/mercenary named Dutch (Arnie) who has been involved in a lot of conflict and has since decided to settle down and be the leader of a rescue team. He goes to a South American country to participate in a mission that would supposedly rescue a Cabinet Minister and a few other hostages, but later on he finds out that he's been set up and it was actually a mission to destroy a rebel base that would've invaded sooner or later. And Dutch gets ticked off and he and his team try to escape the jungle, but they're then being pursued by an alien who hunts rather than kills. As the situation escalates, Dutch starts to lose his sanity and that's totally evident in the final showdown with the creature.Like James Cameron's Aliens that came out the year before, Predator is shaped by it's excellent characters, Dutch is the great, silent leader who is somewhat broken inside from all the combat that he went through in the past and his quote If it bleeds, we can kill it is among the greatest. Blain is the totally cool tobacco-chewing, mini-gun-totting guy who spewed out 2 of the movie's best lines I ain't got time to bleed, and This stuff'll make you a goddamn sexual tyrannosaurus, just like me. Mac is pretty much Blain's best bud and frequently shaves with his razor and without the shaving cream to show his manliness. Hawkins is the super-nerd of the group who reads comic books and occasionally makes some sick jokes about his girlfriend. Billy is the silent, no-nonsense spiritual dude. Dillon is the dirty CIA agent who was best pals with Dutch a few years back and then sets up Dutch and his team, which leads to their demise and his, as well. And finally, Poncho is the sympathetic, yet sarcastic soldier who connects with Anna, their hostage, during the course of the film. And these guys are great characters; and they each have their own personalities, which makes you want to see more out of each guy.And of course, I can't forget about the Predator. The high-tech alien that hunts other creatures for sport was a very creative and original idea. It also held a very intimidating presence and the special effects were very well done, especially the camouflage. And I'm still wondering how that managed to do that in 1987.And last, but not the least, the action really stands out thanks to the direction of John McTiernan, who directed this right before he made Die Hard.

The Day the Earth Stood Still has earned its place in history for turning sci-fi into a genre in its own right.One thing that makes The Day the Earth Stood Still different from earlier sci-fi pictures is that it adds an element of horror. It not only attempts to terrify us with the thought an extra-terrestrial threat, it actually borrows techniques from the horror genre to unsettle us. Director Robert Wise's earliest assignments were at Val Lewton's B-unit at RKO, and he had slipped in touches of Lewton-esquire horror atmospherics, where appropriate, into the handful of thrillers and Westerns he had made since then. He subtly continues this pattern here, adding layers of creepiness to many scenes with low-key lighting, distant vanishing points and looming framing devices. Bernard Hermann's theremin score compliments this mood.The Day the Earth Stood Still is also unusual in that its story is told on a global scale, and needs to show events going on simultaneously all over the world &#150; something that was quite unusual in cinema prior to this. This is where Robert Wise's background as an editor comes in. Although no longer cutting the pictures himself, he shows awareness of what an editor needs. Take those opening scenes in which the spaceship is first spotted &#150; the sense of movement and lighting in each shot seems aimed at making each one compliment the next. The actual editor William Reynolds (one of the best in the business; he also did the job on The Godfather) uses Wise's material to put together some powerful sequences, expertly building up the intensity as panic spreads across the globe, or dropping back down to an eerie calm.You can see why people love The Day the Earth Stood Still. There is power and profundity to the message, the plot is nicely balanced and the analogy to the Jesus story is well-defined but not overstated (although funnily Klaatu's ultimatum is more reminiscent of the Old Testament God who sent the deluge). And yet on closer inspection it does have its flaws. The dialogue is fairly trite and some moments are just daft. The acting is mediocre, and it seems faintly ridiculous how obvious Michael Rennie's RADA accent is when he speaks in the alien language. Like Fight Club or Memento today, this is one of those clever films that wows people first time round, but won't seem so amazing on repeated viewings. It may be an important picture in cinema history, and it is certainly memorable, but it isn't a brilliantly put together package and doesn't hold up as entertainment.

George MacReady, Glen Ford and Rita Hayworth handle these to a fare-thee-well and when you add crackling dialogue we're talking close to classic.

All I'd heard was that it was quite strange, and then knew of a lot of the actors featuring in it (along with the fact it's directed by Tim Burton). Well, it being strange certainly was right. But, in my opinion, that is what makes the film what it is. Just the sheer ridiculousness yet brilliance of some of the scenes captivated me. The aspects of parody and social commentary stop it from becoming totally ridiculous and a lot of the wit involved in the film kept me amused. People who want obvious sense and meaning should possibly think before watching this film, but otherwise I would highly recommend it. My friend and I found a lot of the scenes were so strange that they had a high entertainment value and we also thought that the film is visually very effective. However, this film is best to watch with someone else, as then you can share the weird and wacky parts and they are easier to accept. Don't write this film off if at first you find it too weird and seemingly pointless; make sure you give it a chance and try to look for the amazing wit which can be found. There is certainly a lot of amusement to be found in Mars Attacks! if you aren't put off by its weirdness.

The parents hire a psychics(Beatrice Straight, Richard Lawson and Zelda Rubinstein) to resolve it.Excellent terror story plenty of screams,chills,thrills and a little bit of humor. God and dazzling though primitive special effects by Richard Edlund. Suspenseful, frightening musical score by the master Jerry Goldsmith. Colorful and appropriate cinematography by Matthew F. Leonetti.This hight budgeted movie is surprisingly written and well produced by Steven Spielberg. Director Tobe Hooper puts accent on suspense and atmosphere as in terror happenings. What transpires in the two hours longtime is a thriller that will leave you physically and emotionally drained. Horror fans should be entertained.Followed by two inferior sequels with little common sense and coherence, as Poltergeist II(1986) by Brian Gibson with similar casting and Poltergeist III(1988) by Gary Sherman with Tom Skerrit, Nancy Allen, Lara Flynn Boyle and Heather O'Rourke who died after the movie's release at 12 age, while his sister Dominique Dunne died at 22 years old killed by her boyfriend.

A pregnant girl who has overdosed in the hallway outside your apartment, for instance, has to be stepped over so that you can get to work on time. A kid born to a junkie mother just down the block is born deaf and without eyes. The kid of another junkie mother who lives directly behind you is born without a brain. Because the child won't live through the night, the young mother is allowed to bring it home. The child dies in her arms. A brother-in-law, strung out on heroin, almost causes his wife to have a miscarriage because he can't function well enough to get her to the hospital when her water breaks. Her baby is born with brain damage as a result. I could go on, but it's late and I'm not really up to this. TRAINSPOTTING is superb film-making, with credible performances, great music, and some of the most surreal sequences ever shot.
