[{"date":"10 April 2009","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" I was in the seventh grade when I impulsively borrowed a VHS tape from an older classmate. I knew nothing about it. It simply looked interesting. I went home and watched it. I had no idea how to react. I felt numb. I felt truly horrified and became obsessed by the feelings this movie gave me. At first, I thought this meant hate, but I gradually found myself fascinated by the notion of seeing the film again. And I realized that if a movie can make you feel so strongly, it's a special film. I have seen it a cautious handful of times in the many years since, and it has yet to lose its effect. Incidentally, I owe a great deal of credit to this film for opening a door for me to pursue more, better, powerful films.Much of what haunted me the first time was the performance of Ellen Burstyn. It is rare that we find movies that feature such dauntless, ballsy and absolutely frighteningly real performances. On one continuous level, she is the embodiment of so many million frail, forgotten old ladies with small worlds and big worries but simple pleasures. What gives her a savory glimmer of hope in the story is such a flight of fancy to such a normal, lonely old woman. On another continuous level, the culmination of her character's course into a nightmarish dreamscape is utterly harrowing. There is nothing to be found in the brutalizing climactic sequences that she says or does that is not excruciatingly undergone by Burstyn. Old women don't get many substantial roles in movies, but isn't Burstyn's Goldfarb the call to action for more? Rarely do we get performances this raw, unrelenting and real from anybody.What is remarkable about this landmark gateway for the new century of American film is how emphatically director Darren Aronofsky shows the psychological conditions of his addicts. When they use, a window opens fleetingly into a world where everything is as they dream. Then it slams closed, and life is basically a scrounge for the money and drugs to open it again. Nothing else is nearly as motivating for them. Aronofsky brings a new imperativeness to the drug movie by trying to recreate, through his idiosyncratically personal approach, how his characters feel, or yearn to feel, or are scared to feel.As this down-to-earth nightmare suddenly begins, a widowed housewife is chaining her television to the radiator. It's no use. Her son frees it, and wheels it down the street to a pawn shop. This is a typical visit, we amass. Anything in his mother's house is a conceivable begetter of cash for drugs. The son's girlfriend and best friend are both dependent on drugs as well. So is the mother to television and sugar. We recall the actors, however remotely. Honestly, save for Marlon Wayans, I had hardly noticed the central cast in any films I'd seen previously. Or at least that's my subjective perception after seeing them in this, to which there's no comparison to the vast majority of the rest of their work, no matter how impressive. Ellen Burstyn's Sara Goldfarb is mussy and overweight in her blowzy house dresses. Her son Harry, played by Jared Leto, is bony and preoccupied. So is his girlfriend Marion, played by Jennifer Connelly. His best friend Tyrone is played by Marlon Wayans, who has minimized all the juice and nerve of his zany personage in the silly movies he's made with his brothers and is just trying to survive in a diplomatic enough way. Tyrone worries, rightly, that he's in trouble but Harry is in more. Burstyn isn't disinclined to play Sara Goldfarb entirely as a disintegrating undoing. Leto's suppurating arm, whipped by too many needles, is like a logo for his life.Aronofsky is transfixed by the way in which the camera can be used to project how his characters see things, showing us some things and withholding others so that we are first submerged into a nonobjective abstraction and then snatched back to neutrality with the chill of the imperturbable real world. As many times as I've seen modern-day visual stylists produce new and innovative camera and editing techniques, those of Aronofsky's, which he has not recycled for his successive efforts, remain truly original and unique. As much as stylistic conventions and easier, more pleasant viewings are important for the sustenance of cinema, its survival depends on mutations and new forays into the vanguard.Aronofsky uses extreme closeups to show drugs immersing his characters. First we see the pills, or the fix, filling the screen, because that's all the characters can think about. Then the injection, swallowing or sniffing because that obliterates the troublesome outside world. Then the pupils of their eyes dilate. All done with intense amplification of sounds. The movie was given the valuelessly ignoble NC-17 rating by the MPAA. Anyone under 17, or over, no matter how young or old, who feels like they may be inclined to dabble with drugs might want to see this movie, which plays like a virtual hell. Many from my own age group have claimed to be much less intrigued by the idea of hard drugs after seeing this film.These sequences are done in fast-motion, to show how rapidly the drugs take effect, and how unsatisfyingly soon they wear off. The intervals flirt with hopeless discomfort. Aronofsky cuts between the mother, a prisoner of her apartment and diet pills, and the other three. Early in the film, he uses a split screen in which the space on both sides is at the disposal of the other. Sara and Harry each have half the screen, but their motions enter into each other's halves. This is an forcibly persuasive manner of showing them alone but together. In an unforgettable ending sequence, he cuts between all four major characters as they lurch toward their irrevocable journey ends.

So this Saturday should not be more than just an unusual day because Dante is working yet it will be an unusual day for many other reasons. My title is a dialog of my favourite character of this film, a dialog of Jeff Anderson's character Randal who like Dante is a clerk and who is Dante's best friend. Clerks, they share many things certainly like for example they must deal with the classic annoying clients (very funny stuff, from the man who for a reason tries to stop clients that want to buy cigarettes to the man who wants something to read since he is going to the bathroom). But of course they are different from each other, while Dante respects the clients Randal spits on them, is very unkind and stuff. Well Randal is in the video store he attends just very few times, he opens late, he is with Dante most of the time, he goes to other video stores, he spits on Dante's clients, well you get how Randal is. So it may be sort of like this of the two friends we have on one hand the responsible one, in short the good one and on the other hand well Randal. But here the thing is that Dante basically does things that are even worse than the things that Randal does, Dante is always saying how unhappy he is with his life because his girlfriend Veronica (Marilyn Ghigliotti) has sucked 37 dicks, because his ex-girlfriend who he still can't forget will get married, because he is working on a Saturday and stuff but he always is the victim for himself, never taking his responsibility. So the big thing in Clerks happens when Dante's ex-girlfriend arrives, at one point Dante will be like my life is a s*** and at other point Dante will blame Randal for ruining his relationship with Veronica, in both points Randal says nothing but true things, certainly after all Dante was the one trying to get back with his ex-girlfriend without saying a thing to his girlfriend. This was an unforgettable day, very important for Dante, he started it with a girlfriend, he ended it without that girlfriend but finally getting rid of his high school love past, at the end of the day he knows that he loves Veronica, he finally saw that Veronica loves him. Randal also had a crazy day, by the end he is like he was at the beginning, which is good for him, after all at one point he says that he is satisfied with his life. After some years of only knowing about its existence I finally saw the debut film of Kevin Smith almost two weeks ago. I also knew Kevin Smith just by hearing and reading stuff about his movies (this one and Zack and Miri Make a Porno being the ones I heard about the most) and with Clerks I had my introduction to his work. I was certainly expecting a whole lot from it, it was a real must wanted film for me and I was really glad when I came across its DVD. Clerks is a terrific debut of Smith, great and very memorable dialog, I didn't feel disappointed at all and I hope soon I can see Clerks II.

A Clockwork Orange pours out his talent as a director. He is well known for his perfectionism and this, combined with his shining vision for films has contributed to a masterful stroke in thought-provoking cinema.Most of you know the plot so I went spend a lot of time slaving over it. It's futuristic Britain, law and order has almost vanished and different gangs of thugs roam the country wreaking havoc wherever they go. The film begins by focusing on one of these gangs, which is led by the films central character, Alex DeLarge (played by the awesome Malcolm McDowell). He and his fellow Droogs (russian for 'Buddies') roam their town causing all kinds of chaos beating the elderly, robbing their victims, breaking into houses and raping women. All these activities playing a part in their pleasure of indulging in a bit of the old ultra-violence. However, a mutiny arises within the group and Alex is left stranded by his Droogs during a house robbery which has left a women dead. The police arrive as Alex is recovering from a bottle smash to the face. Whilst in prison, he longs for freedom and his opportunity comes when a new method is introduced. The newly elected government wants to crack down on crime and by trying to do this, they conjure a method which involves transforming current convicts into law-abiding, good citizens. Sounds good? it may do but the description is only scratching the surface as we are taken into a dark world of state control and brain-washing techniques.The debate raised within the film in terms of criminals being brain-washing tests the minds of the audience. They are criminals, murderers after all, as in the case of Alex. However, during the scenes of the experiments, you can't help but feel it still isn't right. Depending on your stance towards reform, the images on screen pluck all sorts of feelings from within you. The message of state control over individuals is resounding. The film is 30 odd years ahead of its time and I believe this to be a testament to the poignancy of the film and also the cleverness of the author of the book, Anthony Burgess. The scenes of ultra-violence are also becoming more and more common in modern life. The scenes are so disturbing, not because of the brute force but because of the sheer pleasure the characters are taking out of the rape and violence as they destroy lives (I'm singing' in the rain!). The lack of a soul, remorse or any human feeling. The performances from all the actors are of near perfection to the vision of Kubrick and the state of Britain which the film is trying to portray. Its future Britain and I think the lack of a blockbuster budget has greatly benefited the film. Instead of building extravagant futuristic sets as seen in Bladerunner and Back to the Future II, the film uses the oddly designed concrete gems from 1960's Britian (notice the sarcasm). This approach not only greatly adds to the realism of the film but also the overall bleakness and reality. The film is also artistically ground-breaking. From the glorious set-designs and costumes, to the use of beautiful classical music being played over the top of images of violence and rape. This juxtaposition works fantastically well, stirring the emotions and thoughts inside us at a constant rate. The language used in the film is not only amusing but also strangely effecting. It's nonsensical language but we still understand every word. It's twisted and subversive and it has a profound effect on the audience. The use of music is also of artistic excellence with a superb blend of electronic noises to Beethovens beauty. The camera work is, at times, breath-taking. The intense angles, slow pans and editing techniques all contribute to the films art. I still adore the opening shot in which Alex and his fellow Droogies are in the milk bar, the zoom out being perfectly executed whilst being accompanied to the futuristic music and surrounded by set- design which is different and mind-dazzlingly brilliant. Jonathon Ross (not known for being the best film critic admittedly) described the film as mind-searingly brilliant and I couldn't agree more...Not only is the film superb, we also have one of the best acting performances seen in British film, and arguably of all film. Malcom McDowell throws everything into his portrayal of the devilish Alex DeLarge. Alex is wrong, twisted and darkly close to being the true devil. However McDowell manages to somehow draw in feelings of sorrow towards him as he goes through the torment of experimentation and its aftermath. As an actor, he had to go through a hell of a lot. Being stuck in a straight-jacket whilst having his eye-lids locked which had to be constantly moistened by water eye drops (resulting in his eye being scratched and temporarily blinded), being held under water for what seemed an eternity, raping a women whilst seemingly being overjoyed and singing his heart out and other moments where his acting credentials were being harshly tested. He passed every single one and pulled off a magnificent performance, shaping the intriguing character that is Alex. A film of artistic brilliance, poignant messages on anarchy and crime soaring, state control over individuals and of the human soul, the film holds so many qualities that it really does boggle the mind. It's too much to take in on one viewing and after each one, you realise just how powerful, relevant and bewildering that A Clockwork Orange really is, coming from a film-maker whose vision is always played out on screen to near perfection, the sign of a truly great director whose come out on top with this legendary film.

The lack of a soul, remorse or any human feeling. The performances from all the actors are of near perfection to the vision of Kubrick and the state of Britain which the film is trying to portray. Its future Britain and I think the lack of a blockbuster budget has greatly benefited the film. Instead of building extravagant futuristic sets as seen in Bladerunner and Back to the Future II, the film uses the oddly designed concrete gems from 1960's Britian (notice the sarcasm). This approach not only greatly adds to the realism of the film but also the overall bleakness and reality. The film is also artistically ground-breaking. From the glorious set-designs and costumes, to the use of beautiful classical music being played over the top of images of violence and rape. This juxtaposition works fantastically well, stirring the emotions and thoughts inside us at a constant rate. The language used in the film is not only amusing but also strangely effecting. It's nonsensical language but we still understand every word. It's twisted and subversive and it has a profound effect on the audience. The use of music is also of artistic excellence with a superb blend of electronic noises to Beethovens beauty. The camera work is, at times, breath-taking. The intense angles, slow pans and editing techniques all contribute to the films art. I still adore the opening shot in which Alex and his fellow Droogies are in the milk bar, the zoom out being perfectly executed whilst being accompanied to the futuristic music and surrounded by set- design which is different and mind-dazzlingly brilliant. Jonathon Ross (not known for being the best film critic admittedly) described the film as mind-searingly brilliant and I couldn't agree more...Not only is the film superb, we also have one of the best acting performances seen in British film, and arguably of all film. Malcom McDowell throws everything into his portrayal of the devilish Alex DeLarge. Alex is wrong, twisted and darkly close to being the true devil. However McDowell manages to somehow draw in feelings of sorrow towards him as he goes through the torment of experimentation and its aftermath. As an actor, he had to go through a hell of a lot. Being stuck in a straight-jacket whilst having his eye-lids locked which had to be constantly moistened by water eye drops (resulting in his eye being scratched and temporarily blinded), being held under water for what seemed an eternity, raping a women whilst seemingly being overjoyed and singing his heart out and other moments where his acting credentials were being harshly tested. He passed every single one and pulled off a magnificent performance, shaping the intriguing character that is Alex. A film of artistic brilliance, poignant messages on anarchy and crime soaring, state control over individuals and of the human soul, the film holds so many qualities that it really does boggle the mind.

","genre":"Crime, Drama, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"10 April 2009","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Kubrick is so immensely clever when it comes to film-making isn't he? A Clockwork Orange pours out his talent as a director. He is well known for his perfectionism and this, combined with his shining vision for films has contributed to a masterful stroke in thought-provoking cinema.Most of you know the plot so I went spend a lot of time slaving over it. It's futuristic Britain, law and order has almost vanished and different gangs of thugs roam the country wreaking havoc wherever they go. The film begins by focusing on one of these gangs, which is led by the films central character, Alex DeLarge (played by the awesome Malcolm McDowell). He and his fellow Droogs (russian for 'Buddies') roam their town causing all kinds of chaos beating the elderly, robbing their victims, breaking into houses and raping women. All these activities playing a part in their pleasure of indulging in a bit of the old ultra-violence. However, a mutiny arises within the group and Alex is left stranded by his Droogs during a house robbery which has left a women dead. The police arrive as Alex is recovering from a bottle smash to the face. Whilst in prison, he longs for freedom and his opportunity comes when a new method is introduced. The newly elected government wants to crack down on crime and by trying to do this, they conjure a method which involves transforming current convicts into law-abiding, good citizens. Sounds good? it may do but the description is only scratching the surface as we are taken into a dark world of state control and brain-washing techniques.The debate raised within the film in terms of criminals being brain-washing tests the minds of the audience. They are criminals, murderers after all, as in the case of Alex. However, during the scenes of the experiments, you can't help but feel it still isn't right. Depending on your stance towards reform, the images on screen pluck all sorts of feelings from within you. The message of state control over individuals is resounding. The film is 30 odd years ahead of its time and I believe this to be a testament to the poignancy of the film and also the cleverness of the author of the book, Anthony Burgess. The scenes of ultra-violence are also becoming more and more common in modern life.

It's no wonder that there are not many films with an actress as the main character. Dancing girls, singing girls, showgirls yes. Aging actresses falling in love with young men or actresses as suspects in a murder mystery, yes. But an actress as a character role no. To play a character who plays a character is such balancing on a thin thread that it takes a lot of experience and courage to take on such a role. Furthermore it is profoundly hard to write about an actress who plays brilliantly how do you attest in a film that an actress (who is played by an actress who should play well) plays well? Either you get two performances who are quite alike or you get some over the top playing which quickly seems bad acting.Joan Crawford was a skilled actress. Faye Dunaway is a skilled actress. But matching the two there emerges a character that no longer acts like a skilled actress but uses all techniques to override life. Every scene Dunaway enters with fire. She takes the emotion, and we see her sometimes taken aback by her own energy. She also is trying to act brilliantly, which means that she is 'in the moment, in the character' and lets her character decide how to proceed with laughter, with anger, with an evil look, with a deep breath. There are a lot of moments where we observe Dunaway look for the right reaction as Crawford, just as is teached in acting classes all around the world but the effect is so strange and overambitious, that the whole performance turns into 'anger for beginners'.The other actors are answering with good old fashioned acting (just saying the lines in the right emotion) or trying to match themselves with Dunaway as the grown up Christina does. She is making every emotion as tiny as possible, counting on this less is more principle to counter Dunaways fury. This doesn't work she just turns into someone who is either careless, numb or lazy.

She is supposed to be an actress as well, but more out of an 'I don't know anything else to do' that out of ambition or love for the profession.The script is uneven, bad at times and puzzling in its message.

When a man lacks the ability to connect with anyone or anything what does he do? This is exactly what the film Five Easy Pieces explorers. Music, a simple life, family, women, friendship all of this he tries to fill in the void in his life and fails. This all works because of the amazing performance of Jack Nicholson. He brings this difficult character to life and gives a power house performance. Nicholson is able to portray a large range of emotions in this film and often does so within the same scene. Robert Dupea is a complex character running away from things unseen and Jack Nicholson makes it all seem so effortless. There is a reason why this movie launched the career of one of America's greatest actors.The one flaw in the film was its inability to incorporate some of the more wonderful shots into the overall narrative of the film. Whenever there was a wide shot of a setting sun, Robert looking out at a lake or showing the wall of photos when we see the long shot of a wall of pictures while Robert play the piano for Catherine are such examples. These scenes should tell part of the story visually but instead they only seem like they are forced into the film because great film has these shots.

Schaffner's biography of General George S. Patton proved the exception to the rule. Patton received seven Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Director, Best Writing, Best Editing, Best Sound and Best Art & Set Direction, and garnered nominations for Best Cinematography, Best Special Effects, and Best Original Music. Repeated screenings of this extraordinary World War II epic combat film, especially George C. Scott's bravura performance, make it difficult to believe that producer Frank McCarthy toiled for 19 years to persuade the Pentagon as well as General Patton's family, both adamantly opposed to it, to help him produce this multi-faceted film. Scenarist Francis Ford Coppola, long before he made his own masterpiece Apocalypse Now, penned one of the earliest versions of the Patton script and realized the deadly pitfalls that lay in the subject matter for any filmmaker. Wait a minute, this guy was obviously nuts. If they want to make a film glorifying him as a great American hero, it will be laughed at. And if I write a film that condemns him, it won't be made at all. Coppola encapsulated the contradictions that confronted McCarthy for nearly twenty years. According to Coppola, only George C. Scott's intervention brought Coppola's long since rejected elements back into the film, particularly the stunning opening with Scott poised in from a gigantic American flag delivering his stirring speech to the troops.Initially, the Patton family opposed Patton, and McCarthy recalled the rage of Colonel George S. Patton III who threatened shoot anybody who made a movie about his father. Indeed, Twentieth Century Fox shelved Patton in 1951 and Warner Brothers following in their footsteps in 1953 not only because the family did not trust the filmmakers, but also because the Pentagon felt any film about Patton would portray the Army in an offensive manner, particularly because the general emerged as such a controversial figure. The family interpreted any movie as an invasion of privacy, lobbied the Pentagon to deny cooperation to filmmakers, and even launched a law suit. Eventually, the Defense Department cooperated, but it provided none of the equipment that appeared in the film. The Spanish Army furnished the tanks, equipment, and troops for the battle sequences. Patton's daughter Ruth Ellen Totten dropped the law suit after she saw Schaffner's film. Reportedly, Totten told her attorneys, Call off the dogs. She gushed about it. I think that it is the best movie I have ever seen since Gone with the Wind. Totten added brother George was thrilled by Scott's portrayal.The positive reception of Patton seems almost inevitable in light of the authenticity of Schaffner's film. McCarthy scored a coup when he convinced General of the Army Omar N. Bradley to serve as 'senior military adviser. Bradley scrutinized the script and later took McCarthy and Schaffner on a tour of the battlefields in Belgium, France, and Tunisia, so Schaffner was confident that we didn't do anything which was outrageous or silly. However, McCarthy had to purchase Bradley's memoirs to obtain his services. Inevitably, Patton compared its insane, quixotic hero with Bradley's more down-to-earth, humanitarian general. Four-star General Paul Harkins, who had been Patton's chief of staff, joined Bradley as another military adviser. These two figures placated the earliest anxieties that the Patton family had about the production.Clocking in at walloping 169 minutes, Patton depicted the celebrated general as an amalgamation of contradictions. He was religious but profane. He was violent but sentimental. George C. Scott perused Patton books and watched news reel films. Indeed, Scott transformed his appearance to resemble the general. Totten called Scott's portrayal tour de force. Winning the acceptance of the Patton family and the military proved one part. Twentieth Century Fox had to win over moviegoers during the era of the Vietnam War with most people agreed that the nation has lost the war. Co-scenarist Edmund North summarized what attracted audiences divided over Vietnam to Patton I believe it was because each person brought to it his own underlying feelings about the Vietnam war. Those who were appalled by Vietnam interpreted Patton a fascinating anti-hero. Those&#x97;like Richard Nixon&#x97;who regarded Vietnam as a noble enterprise could find comfort and support in Patton's self-righteous and dedicated savagery. President Nixon watched Patton twice and admired the general's arch-authoritarian attitude. Later, Nixon denied in an interview with David Frost in 1977 that the film Patton had inspired him to launch his Cambodian invasion Cambodia five days after watching Patton the second time. The film has many memorable moments, especially Patton's orders to a chaplain to intervene with God with a prayer for good weather and the scene in the desert when Patton leaps out of a window to fire on a German aircraft. Karl Mauldin is fabulous as General Bradley and there are tanks galore. Every World War II fan should put Patton on their required viewing list of movies.

Scott's bravura performance, make it difficult to believe that producer Frank McCarthy toiled for 19 years to persuade the Pentagon as well as General Patton's family, both adamantly opposed to it, to help him produce this multi-faceted film. Scenarist Francis Ford Coppola, long before he made his own masterpiece Apocalypse Now, penned one of the earliest versions of the Patton script and realized the deadly pitfalls that lay in the subject matter for any filmmaker. Wait a minute, this guy was obviously nuts. If they want to make a film glorifying him as a great American hero, it will be laughed at. And if I write a film that condemns him, it won't be made at all. Coppola encapsulated the contradictions that confronted McCarthy for nearly twenty years. According to Coppola, only George C. Scott's intervention brought Coppola's long since rejected elements back into the film, particularly the stunning opening with Scott poised in from a gigantic American flag delivering his stirring speech to the troops.Initially, the Patton family opposed Patton, and McCarthy recalled the rage of Colonel George S. Patton III who threatened shoot anybody who made a movie about his father. Indeed, Twentieth Century Fox shelved Patton in 1951 and Warner Brothers following in their footsteps in 1953 not only because the family did not trust the filmmakers, but also because the Pentagon felt any film about Patton would portray the Army in an offensive manner, particularly because the general emerged as such a controversial figure. The family interpreted any movie as an invasion of privacy, lobbied the Pentagon to deny cooperation to filmmakers, and even launched a law suit. Eventually, the Defense Department cooperated, but it provided none of the equipment that appeared in the film. The Spanish Army furnished the tanks, equipment, and troops for the battle sequences. Patton's daughter Ruth Ellen Totten dropped the law suit after she saw Schaffner's film. Reportedly, Totten told her attorneys, Call off the dogs. She gushed about it. I think that it is the best movie I have ever seen since Gone with the Wind. Totten added brother George was thrilled by Scott's portrayal.The positive reception of Patton seems almost inevitable in light of the authenticity of Schaffner's film. McCarthy scored a coup when he convinced General of the Army Omar N. Bradley to serve as 'senior military adviser. Bradley scrutinized the script and later took McCarthy and Schaffner on a tour of the battlefields in Belgium, France, and Tunisia, so Schaffner was confident that we didn't do anything which was outrageous or silly. However, McCarthy had to purchase Bradley's memoirs to obtain his services. Inevitably, Patton compared its insane, quixotic hero with Bradley's more down-to-earth, humanitarian general. Four-star General Paul Harkins, who had been Patton's chief of staff, joined Bradley as another military adviser. These two figures placated the earliest anxieties that the Patton family had about the production.Clocking in at walloping 169 minutes, Patton depicted the celebrated general as an amalgamation of contradictions. He was religious but profane. He was violent but sentimental. George C. Scott perused Patton books and watched news reel films. Indeed, Scott transformed his appearance to resemble the general. Totten called Scott's portrayal tour de force. Winning the acceptance of the Patton family and the military proved one part. Twentieth Century Fox had to win over moviegoers during the era of the Vietnam War with most people agreed that the nation has lost the war. Co-scenarist Edmund North summarized what attracted audiences divided over Vietnam to Patton I believe it was because each person brought to it his own underlying feelings about the Vietnam war. Those who were appalled by Vietnam interpreted Patton a fascinating anti-hero. Those&#x97;like Richard Nixon&#x97;who regarded Vietnam as a noble enterprise could find comfort and support in Patton's self-righteous and dedicated savagery. President Nixon watched Patton twice and admired the general's arch-authoritarian attitude. Later, Nixon denied in an interview with David Frost in 1977 that the film Patton had inspired him to launch his Cambodian invasion Cambodia five days after watching Patton the second time. The film has many memorable moments, especially Patton's orders to a chaplain to intervene with God with a prayer for good weather and the scene in the desert when Patton leaps out of a window to fire on a German aircraft. Karl Mauldin is fabulous as General Bradley and there are tanks galore. Every World War II fan should put Patton on their required viewing list of movies.

And I don't understand why people say the The Hunt for Red October is THE submarine film. Because, to me THFRO was very long and moved at a snail's pace, and also the murky underwater action scenes were hard to look at because you could hardly see what was going on.However, Crimson Tide is an improvement in my opinion. It's over 2 hours long, but its pace moves by so fast that you're not gonna realize it. But if you're looking for tons of explosions and gunfire, then this ain't your kind of movie, it happens to be more suspense-oriented. Otherwise, you can just check out Die Hard, Terminator or Aliens, for the action-packed extravaganza that most people want. But I guess the scene in which the subs face off and each are firing the torpedoes at each other could be considered action. And that scene in probably the best part of the entire movie since there is no way anyone could resist the suspense and especially when the sub is sinking and the water pressure is rising and it could compress at any second.Without going on and on too much I'll just give the basic premise of the movie so you won't get too confused. It's been a couple years after the Soviet Union collapsed and now a radical leader and his followers are trying to takeover the Russian government and is threatening to launch nuclear missiles into both the United States and Russia itself if they interfere with him. And the USA sends a submarine with nuclear missiles out to the Pacific Ocean in case the event of when the Russian missiles are launched and they could instantly counter-attack. But the two commanding officers clash on whether or not the missiles should be fired since they are debating if Russia is attacking or not. But since they are so far down in sea level, they can't communicate to get their orders. At first, it may seem uninteresting, but you'll realize how much suspense and tension is in here when you see it.As for the acting, well what can I say? Denzel Washington has gotta be the greatest method actor in Hollywood right now and Crimson Tide is a prime example. So far in his career, he already won an Oscar for Glory and Training Day in which he gave two outstanding performances that will forever be remembered in Hollywood. But his work in Crimson Tide is, and I dare say, tops both of his Oscar-winning performances. He plays the lead role as Lt. Commander Ron Hunter, who is objecting his Captain's orders to attack Russia since it would cause a complete nuclear holocaust with billions of deaths involved.Gene Hackman, who is another Hollywood favorite, is Captain Frank Ramsey, the crazy old guy who will stop at nothing to ensure that World War III between the USA and Russia happens. His character even preferred to have a missile drill happening when the sub had a fire and its safety was endangered, and as a result an officer lost his life.Hackman's character represents the way the USA was before in a time of war, and they seeked anything to get involved in that war so other countries would fear them. Washington's character symbolizes what the USA is like during the 1990's and they would try to stay as neutral as possible. Also, the scene when Denzel and Gene are arguing and shouting over each other about the nukes and before the mutiny happens has gotta be one of the greatest acted scenes ever. And this basically provides the tension that makes Crimson Tide what it is as a film. And the bulk of the movie, the question Will they launch or not? goes on. Just watch it and found out.Also, the dialogue is among the best I've ever heard, and heck, I'll say that it even challenges Pulp Fiction as having some of the best lines ever. What's interesting is that Quentin Tarantino provided some of it in here and that's clearly evident. The Silver Surfer reference and the submarine movie trivia are the real punch-ups here. My favorite line from this is You don't put on a condom unless you're gonna f**k!.Crimson Tide is an excellent thriller movie that stands out because of the suspense, the tension, the acting and the punchy dialogue.

With such a big budget, of course being an American film, they were so many possibilities crushed by these two 'geniuses'. To begin this review I'll mention a few positive notes. A very few. First off, obviously, the special effects and budget is bigger than any Godzilla film before or after it. The CGI is put to good use and GINO (Godzilla In Name Only) does look decent. There were some all right action scenes, but nothing to get too excited about. And that's about it...Now to the bad points. For starters, this shouldn't even been called a Godzilla movie. GINO looks nothing like Godzilla! Instead of seeing the imposing reptilian, original, looking-monster we get a mutant iguana who is now an asexual T-Rex with no heat ray with NO HEAT RAY!!! Who also is from time to time actually running away from the military! Also, none of the other G-films exist in this film's timeline, not even Gojira! Not a single reference or at least a cameo is made to any G-film or Japanese monster cinema in general! How crappy is that?! Secondly, I didn't like the cast, some who were bad actors. They only added to the non Godzillaness of the movie. Thirdly, the mood of the film is horrible. Godzilla was a victim of the H-bomb test. An invincible incarnation and physical manifestation of the Atomic Bomb. Even in the kiddy and campy days, Godzilla wasn't the giant mutant tarantula or grasshopper of the American 60s and 70s monster films. He was a different type of monster who broke the formula, something original. GINO is just the modern CGI version of those American crap monsters, a giant animal who was killed by jets pathetically. Which brings me to my next point- GINO is too weak and cowardly. Godzilla was invulnerable to tank shells and missiles and did not fear them. He in fact crushed them like bugs. Most of the actual city action\/destruction was thanks to the military's bad aim, not GINO. Who, as mentioned before, runs away!! WTF? He wasn't even a threat really. Just a misunderstood giant asexual lizard who's only danger to society is comparable to that of multiplying locust and rabbits.I see Dean Delvin and Rolland Emmerich's whole scheme Make a modern day giant monster film and to ensure its success they needed to use the name of the most popular monster on Earth Godzilla. That's all they did, use his name. Those two had no respect for Godzilla, or the Japanese sci-fi genre at all. If they had, it certainly wouldn't have came out like this. That's one reason why I like Godzilla Final Wars. We finally see the real Godzilla blast GINO off the face of the Earth in a brisk 30 seconds!

Although Hoodlum boasts a top-drawer cast, including Laurence Fishburne, Vanessa Williams, Tim Roth, and Andy Garcia, this lavishly mounted but uneven gangster saga suffers from its rambling length, garrulous script and a shortage of shoot-outs. As the first major film to headline the crimes of Harlem's infamous Black Godfather Ellsworth 'Bumpy' Johnson, this production offers a novel departure for audiences that are weary of superheroes, female warriors and hard-bitten cops who have were crowding the big-screen when Hoodlum appeared in 1997.The Chris Brancato screenplay introduces Bumpy in 1934 as he exits Sing Sing Prison. Duke and Brancato exert great pains to differentiate Bumpy from the typical African-American mobster. He peruses books, plays chess, and pens poetry. As literate as Bumpy is, he can pull a trigger or wield a knife without a pang of remorse when somebody threatens a person who he loves. Like The Godfather II and Once Upon A Time in America, Hoodlum charts the rise of the Godfather of Harlem in a ruthless game of survival that claims his best friend Illinois Gordon (Chi McBride of I, Robot) and leaves Bumpy forever altered by the gory experience. Ostensibly, you won't see anything in Hoodlum that you haven't seen in dozens of other crime films. Hoodlum features notorious real-life racketeers such as Dutch Schultz (Tim Roth of Pulp Fiction) and Lucky Luciano (Andy Garcia of Godfather III) as well as corrupt special prosecutor Thomas Dewey (William Atherton of The Sugarland Express). When Bumpy arrives in Harlem, he watches a numbers runner working for Madam Stephanie St. Clair (Cicely Tyson) who is the so-called 'Queen of the Numbers.' The Dutchman craves to absorb the territory that the Madam has struggled for a decade to build into the number one home-grown Harlem business. Bumpy vows to prevent any takeover by the Irish mob.Meanwhile, the boorish, grubby, low-life Schultz refuses to appease Lucky or Bumpy. Along the way, Bumpy falls in love with righteous Francine (Vanessa Williams) who wants him to find respectable work. Bumpy refuses to stoop to menial employment. When Dutch cannot kill the Madam, he bribes a judge to send her to the pen. Bumpy supervises the Madam's empire at her request during her absence. Bumpy's bloodthirsty methods clash with her live-and-let-live notions. Eventually, Luciano and Bumpy strike a deal, and Dutch finds himself out in the cold. Suddenly, gangster gunfire chops down a young, innocent numbers runner. Now, Bumpy's cronies think that he has gone too far. Francine bails out on him more out of the formulaic dictates of the story than for any motivated reason. So do the filmmakers. The second half of the movie shows Bumpy losing favor with everybody.The film's publicity notes claim that Hoodlum is complete fiction, but historical characters populate the story. Of course, movies rarely recreate history with any fidelity. History is more chaotic than dramatic, so filmmakers recast it to fit their dramatic formulas. One way is by cutting the number of characters. Refusing to portray these events as they actually occurred, Duke and Brancato blow a fantastic opportunity to exploit their melodramatic potential. Duke, whose directorial credits include Deep Cover and A Rage in Harlem, wrestles with the obvious lapses in Brancato's script. The length of Hoodlum may have been cut by the studio to squeeze in more showings in a single evening. The action grows and takes on an episodic quality when Bumpy becomes callous. After the first half, the film's momentum bogs down, and Hoodlum loses its air of fun. The time has come for the characters to pay the piper.The filmmakers embrace a curious morality. In most gangster movies, the hoodlum hero must die. Bumpy gets off easy, as does Luciano and only Dutch antes up with his life. Duke and Brancato allow their criminals greater leniency. The gangsters are less cancerous than the defenders of justice. Consequently, Hoodlum concludes on an anti-climax. Moreover, the filmmakers neglect to post an epilogue about Bumpy's outcome. For the record, the gangster who hires Shaft to find his kidnapped daughter in Shaft is a variation on Bumpy as is the kingpin mobster in American Gangster with Denzel Washington. The problem with Brancato's script is its uneven quality. The action-packed first half is more entertaining than the tedious, long-winded second half. The filmmakers glorify Bumpy initially as a Robin Hood gangster who steals from a rival mob and gives to Harlem's starving citizens.Fishburne is riveting as a tough-as-nails but warm-hearted criminal. Roth takes top acting honors, however, as Dutch Schultz and looks like he had a ball exaggerating those vile elements in Schultz's psychotic behavior. Garcia epitomizes sartorial urbanity as the peace-making Italian gangster who divides his time between Bumpy, Dutch, and special prosecutor Dewey. Atherton's egotistical special prosecutor bristles with revulsion in his dealings with these crooks, but accepts their bribes. The filmmakers make the repressive Dewey appear particularly loathsome, a Judas whose contempt for the mob is exceeded only by his mockery of justice.Despite some flavorful dialogue, Hoodlum plays it straight down the line as a dramatic shoot'em up. Audiences expecting a variation on Eddie Murphy's Harlem Nights may leave this Fishburne film disappointed. Although it's no Godfather, Hoodlum is definitely above-average and far beyond those 1970s camp classics that headlined Fred Williamson as the black Caesar of crime in Hell Up in Harlem. If you enjoy gangster epics, Hoodlum is worth the price of admission. Some critics have savaged Hoodlum for its debatable morality. Ironically, Bumpy rises to the summit of his profession. At fade-out, however, Duke and Brancato show that the gangster's life is one that leaves you standing alone in the rain outside the church door without a friend.

Roth takes top acting honors, however, as Dutch Schultz and looks like he had a ball exaggerating those vile elements in Schultz's psychotic behavior. Garcia epitomizes sartorial urbanity as the peace-making Italian gangster who divides his time between Bumpy, Dutch, and special prosecutor Dewey. Atherton's egotistical special prosecutor bristles with revulsion in his dealings with these crooks, but accepts their bribes. The filmmakers make the repressive Dewey appear particularly loathsome, a Judas whose contempt for the mob is exceeded only by his mockery of justice.Despite some flavorful dialogue, Hoodlum plays it straight down the line as a dramatic shoot'em up. Audiences expecting a variation on Eddie Murphy's Harlem Nights may leave this Fishburne film disappointed. Although it's no Godfather, Hoodlum is definitely above-average and far beyond those 1970s camp classics that headlined Fred Williamson as the black Caesar of crime in Hell Up in Harlem. If you enjoy gangster epics, Hoodlum is worth the price of admission. Some critics have savaged Hoodlum for its debatable morality. Ironically, Bumpy rises to the summit of his profession. At fade-out, however, Duke and Brancato show that the gangster's life is one that leaves you standing alone in the rain outside the church door without a friend.

He actually spit on one of them at a show and then was taken aback with his own actions, since this was not the impetus that began Pink Floyd back in the summer of love.Careful looks at Pink Floyd's work will see how the spectre of Syd Barrett's mental breakdown - from a well-adjusted bright young lad and friend to a vacant burned out husk who was unrecognizable as his former self - informs their work. A commentary about the things in the business world that crush the spirit of innocent artists, and the band's own guilt at not trying to take a hand in preventing it.This, coupled with Roger Water's own feelings about the death of his father in World War II and how this affected him led to the creation of the character Pink - an amalgam of Waters' and Barrett's lives.From here, one can follow along with each stage of psychology - The Mother Imprint, The Father Imprint, School Experiences, and how this ultimately leads to an incapacity for healthy Social Interaction with his peers and wife.This leads to addiction, and the over-reactive need for control.The movie is not glorifying the damaged rock-musician cliché - nor is it trying to be a neato psychedelic movie to watch under the influence of hallucinogens, though these overtones are there.It is a movie describing the different psychological bricks that build up a wall between an artist and the rest of the world - a cry out to the rest of humanity to be humane and recognize the factors that are driving sensitive people all around us into dysfunction.At the end, the children are left to pick up the pieces...

I am a fan of Shakespeare's works, and even though I know this film is not the least bit historically accurate, I was still fascinated by this concept that Shakespeare's plays could have been inspired by a secret romance such as the one in the film. I loved watching how much his play Romeo and Juliet changed throughout the film and his romance evolved the play until it became the one we all know and love. There are great performances in this film, including a best actress Oscar for Gwenyth Palthrow. For me, the most noteworthy performance is Judi Dench, an absolutely flawless and funny performance as the Queen, for which she won a much-deserved supporting actress Academy Award. I do have a few small problems with this film. First, there are a few parts in the movie that come off a bit cheesy to me, such as Shakespeare pretending to be the maid by covering his head with a sheet. Also, what about a man dressed as a woman being mistaken for the woman pretending to be a man? I don't know. It seemed cheesy to me. With things like that in the film, it doesn't seem right that the film should win Best Picture, especially when it was up against two nearly perfect nominees, Saving Private Ryan and Life is Beautiful. All in all, a fun and fascinating film, but not perfect. Had it not won Best Picture, I probably would not critique it so much, but despite that, I recommend it, especially to those interested in Shakespeare.***1\/2 out of **** ","genre":null},{"date":"10 April 2009","score":"","review":" Here's the thing.

And the Magic Kingdom recruited an old villain from another some other films to be the fall guy in Herbie Rides Again.Our magical Volkswagen is now in the care of Mrs. Steinmetz played by Helen Hayes. As its explained Dean Jones has gone off to Europe to race and his mechanic Buddy Hackett got control of Herbie and he went off to Tibet, leaving Herbie in the hands of his aunt Helen Hayes. Helen Hayes and Buddy Hackett as blood relations is an interesting concept to wrap your mind around. Helen lives a quiet life in a converted old firehouse with Herbie guarding her.She needs guarding because Keenan Wynn who played Alonzo Hawk in the Absent Minded Professor and Son Of Flubber is after her property which stands in the way of him building the world's biggest 130 story skyscraper to uglify San Francisco's scenery. Wynn's the guy who on a tour of Rome looks at the Colosseum and decides it would make a great location for a shopping mall.Wynn sends his young nephew Ken Berry who still thinks his uncle is not a rat to negotiate thinking his naiveté will disarm Helen Hayes. It might disarm her, but there's no fooling the smartest car in the world. And definitely no fooling Hayes's granddaughter Stefanie Powers. But Berry smartens up and soon he's with Hayes, Powers, and Herbie.While Alonzo Hawk was a major character in the two Flubber films, in Herbie Rides Again, Keenan Wynn gets an opportunity to become one full blown ham and he makes the most of it. It's a pleasure to see him feasting on a diet of scenery. Watching him I couldn't help thinking was the same guy flummoxed by Fred MacMurray and Flubber. It seems when he's up against the supernatural, Alonzo Hawk just ain't at his best.Berry and Powers make a nice young couple and Hayes is given a bit of a romantic interest in visiting cattle rancher John McIntire who's in town on a toot and gets captivated by the whole Herbie mystique. Herbie Rides Again is a nice successor to the original and gives an opportunity for some of the best players around to strut their stuff.
