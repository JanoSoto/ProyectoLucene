During the movie, you can hear songs ¡®The Sound of Music¡¯, ¡®My Favorite Things¡¯, ¡®You Are Sixteen, Going on Seventeen¡¯, ¡®Do¡ªRe¡ªMi¡¯, and so on. The whole story develops accompanied with music, that¡¯s to say music is the main clue throughout the film. The music and the story have combined perfectly. It is a greatest success of the film.At the very beginning of the movie, Maria introduces herself by the song of ¡®Maria¡¯. We know more about her by the other nuns singing. She is hired to care for the seven children of the widowed Austrian captain Von Trapp. On her way to the captain¡¯s villa, Maria is singing all the time in order to overcome her nervousness. It is music that makes her relax. At first, she does meet some difficulties. However, she estanblishes a bridge by musical material. The bridge leads her to the children¡¯s hearts. It is music that makes the children change their attitude to her. During the following days, Maria and the children get well along with each other. Similarly, it is music that removes the obstacles in communication. Romanticly, Maria and the captain fall in love with each other. In a soft night, they come across to meet, taking that occasion, they express desires to each other by singing. It is so romantic that I wish I were Maria at that moment. Maria is no longer a nun. She is Von Trapp¡¯s wife. Once again, it is music that changes Maria¡¯s way of life.The song ¡®Edelweiss¡¯ strikes me deeply. It is a patriotic song. The song always recalls me of the scene the whole family fighting against the Nazis. They are very brave. They do not give in by the enemies¡¯ enforcement. At the end, they manage to escape from trap by their excellent performance. What the Nazis armies do is in vain. It is music that lifts them out of danger.All of them are small pieces of Edelweiss, as the lines go ¡®Edelweiss, Edelweiss, bless my homeland forever¡­¡­¡¯In all occasions, we can hear music.

Wes Craven's New Nightmare is a complete overhaul of the Nightmare on Elm Street formula, transferring it from the fictional Elm Street and into the real world. It would seem like a cheesy premise, Freddy is such a bad guy that he's even coming to life on the movie sets, but the idea makes it work.Wes Craven has been having nightmares again, and since his nightmares tend to be where he gets his best ideas (much like many other horror writers, directors, etc, not the least of which is Stephen King), he decides that this must mean it's time to make another Elm Street movie. Heather Langenkamp, who played the terrorized Nancy Thompson in Nightmares 1 and 3, takes on the role of herself. She's now 30 years old and has a child, but is gradually coming to realize that the strange things that have been happening and nightmares of Freddy that she has been having are way too similar to what happened in her movies, and she gradually comes to realize that it's all real. Some of the best moments are when she goes to talk to Wes Craven about it, to tell her what has been happening, and it is all stuff that he has already written into his new but unfinished script.Craven explains that the evil inside Freddy Kruger is actually an ancient evil that has merely been temporarily trapped inside the character of Freddy and the stories of the Nightmare on Elm Street movies, that as long as the story is kept active, the evil can be contained. Now that the movies have ended, he explains, the evil force within Freddy has been set free. There's a great scene where he tells Heather that the reason the story has died is because that's what happens when people water it down to make it an easier sell. This is a strikingly insightful comment to be made within a horror film, but it strikes me as strange since it's so obvious that he's referring to the load of bad sequels in the Nightmare on Elm Street series, only two of which he directed (the original and this one) but almost all of which he either produced or wrote. So anyway, Freddy has managed to separate himself from both Robert Englund, the actor that played him in the movies, and the Nightmare movies as well, and have entered our world. This is a hell of a lot better than Freddy Takes Manhattan!The movie takes place in an interesting parallel reality, it's not the reality in the movies and it's not the real world, but somewhere in between. All of the actors from the movies all play themselves and there is much talk of 'our world' and 'the real world,' but only the actors from previous movies play themselves, all the other people in the movie are characters played by actors, not the least of which is Heather's son, Dylan, who turns out to be the most powerful person in the movie. Dylan starts having nightmares and reacts as any kid his age would, not wanting to go to sleep and wanting mom to spend the night with him. Why she refuses for most of the movie is never really explains. She of all people must understand what he's going through!Ultimately, Freddy is able to come through and kill people when Dylan sleeps, and it seems that Freddy capitalizes on this, using the kid both as leverage and as a means to get into his world. There is a scene where Dylan runs across a freeway at night during heavy traffic, and Freddy appears in the sky and lifts him up, helping him across the freeway unharmed. This leaves the question of whether Freddy did this to protect his path into this world or just to taunt his mother, Heather, who is following closely behind and ready to run into traffic herself to save her son.(spoilers) There is also an homage scene involving Dylan's surprisingly dedicated babysitter in the hospital, she tries to prevent the nurses from putting him to sleep and ends up in a scene reminiscent of a classic scene from the first film. One of my favorite parts of the movie is how the actors near the end of the film relapse back into their roles, doing things like dressing as their characters and calling Heather Nancy and things like that, further blurring the line between the fiction from the previous films, our reality, and the reality presented in the movie. This is great stuff, but the movie really starts to slip near the end.Needless to say, there is a climactic scene in a horrific dungeon setting, with Heather and Dylan trying to escape and kill Freddy at the same time. Freddy gets his tongue forked, an interesting scene at a time when tongue piercings were simply the cool things to have, but then what? Freddy gets killed by fire? That's it?? Has Wes Craven ever seen a horror movie? Fire never kills the slashers! And to make matters worse, after Heather and Dylan finally 'kill' Freddy, we fast forward a bit and they're at home and Heather gets a copy of the script from Craven, and what does she do? She picks it up and starts reading it to Dylan! Is she MAD??? I think that New Nightmare stands as one of the best of the entire series, along with the original film, and despite these weak shortcomings, it is a tremendously well-made horror movie. It's thought out where most horror films aren't, it has a premise that's fascinating in the same way that things like time travel are fascinating, and it will surely please Nightmare fans eager to get a look at the Nightmare on Elm Street sets as well as the cavernous mansion that Craven has managed to afford from being royalty in the horror movie production world. I definitely recommend this one.

Now I finally got around to completing my Russell Crowe DVD collection. So I also ordered the widescreen signature edition of the 'Gladiator', two disks (second disk with bonus material) from Amazon.com. I received the DVD last Tuesday. On Wednesday I watched it for the first time. On Thursday I watched the bonus material and part of the movie again. Now it's been a week and I have already watched it 3 times and I am already thinking about watching it again tonight. It's a masterpiece of its kind with one of the most magnificent photography and brilliant special effects I have ever seen. Russell Crowe as Maximus is absolutely perfect. He is the true hero such a movie needs. Though the rest of the cast is also well chosen and gives a great performance, Russell Crowe is the character this movie needed to become outstanding. With each viewing you will discover another interesting detail, another facial expression that wows. I also recommend watching the bonus material disk after the first viewing. It will give you an astonishing behind the scene look at how the movie was made and how real some scenes actually are. The documentary on Gladiator games provides an interesting insight into the whole subject. And don't miss the deleted scenes. They shouldn't have been cut out. The sound track especially the main theme is also overwhelming. One of my favorite scenes is where Russell Crowe rides the pirouette on the grey horse at the end of a fight. The music perfectly matches the scene. The Gladiator is fun watching even though it is a tough movie. My score is 10 out of 10.

Now I finally got around to completing my Russell Crowe DVD collection. So I also ordered the widescreen signature edition of the 'Gladiator', two disks (second disk with bonus material) from Amazon.com. I received the DVD last Tuesday. On Wednesday I watched it for the first time. On Thursday I watched the bonus material and part of the movie again. Now it's been a week and I have already watched it 3 times and I am already thinking about watching it again tonight. It's a masterpiece of its kind with one of the most magnificent photography and brilliant special effects I have ever seen. Russell Crowe as Maximus is absolutely perfect. He is the true hero such a movie needs. Though the rest of the cast is also well chosen and gives a great performance, Russell Crowe is the character this movie needed to become outstanding. With each viewing you will discover another interesting detail, another facial expression that wows. I also recommend watching the bonus material disk after the first viewing. It will give you an astonishing behind the scene look at how the movie was made and how real some scenes actually are. The documentary on Gladiator games provides an interesting insight into the whole subject. And don't miss the deleted scenes. They shouldn't have been cut out. The sound track especially the main theme is also overwhelming. One of my favorite scenes is where Russell Crowe rides the pirouette on the grey horse at the end of a fight.

Being as I am, a total Peter O'Toole admirer, I only watched this coz he was in it. And I'm so glad I did, because I absolutely loved his Zaltar character!!!! I think Zaltar make come close to knocking Tiberius (Peter's Caligula role) off my fave O'Toole character list! I really wish this movie had been more about Zaltar and how he came to create Argo City rather than Supergirl. I'll even forgive the costume designers for forcing my beloved Peter to wear a rather frightful piece of knitwear in this film.Jerry Goldmsith's wonderful score really stuck in my head, especially the Flying Ballet sequence. I'm currently trawling eBay for a copy. Also the opening titles are pretty good, but that's about it. The film itself suffers from so many plot holes that it's impossible to grasp what's supposed to be happening. So many things left me puzzled. How does Supergirl suddenly acquire her powers while traveling to Earth? Why did Zaltar give her the Omegahedron in the first place knowing full well how important it was to the city's survival? And why does nobody on Earth ever notice Supergirl as she flies overhead? Faye Dunaway is gulity of chronic overacting. The opening shot of Argo City looks like it's made out of a milk carton. Some obvious back projection, and other naff SFX don't help either, and the ending is just ludicrous. Still it was a fun way to spend a rather dull Monday afternoon, and I give this film a far higher rating than it deserves because of Peter's superb performance. He really took this role seriously.

Scientists receive radio signals from outer space that, when decoded, include an alien form of DNA and instructions for combining it with human DNA, resulting in attractive human creatures that have attributes of the alien species. In the opening scene of the movie, scientists are trying to gas a cute little blonde girl to death, having learned that this particular alien species is far more than we can handle and, my god, making it female didn't make it more docile and controllable after all. I find the beginning premise fascinating to no end, but probably because I always forget that such story lines are dreamed up by people who have no more clue about what's out there than I do, so I'm probably not going to learn anything. That's why movies like this tend to go downhill in the second half.One of the most startling characteristics of this new species is its rapid growth rate. The subject has grown to the size and appearance of a 10-year-old girl after only a few days, and then before long into the statuesque form of Natasha Henstridge not long after. At this point, still well within the confines of the first act, it may become apparent that, if she has grown to maturity almost immediately, you might think she would grow into an old woman and die of old age before the week is out. Later in the movie you may also wonder how a few cells can grow into a bubbling mass of organic matter before the very eyes of shocked and frightened scientists with no nourishment whatsoever. What is being metabolized to allow it to grow like that?No matter. It's strange that the movie started off with such an interesting premise, a radio signal from a clearly intelligent alien species, and then all of a sudden we realize that that intelligent species is nothing but another slimy Hollywood alien. Try to imagine this alien, in its own form, sitting down to compose a radio signal including instructions for how to combine two types of DNA, and you have the chink in this movie's already thin armor. Forest Whitaker is great as the movie's resident psychic, I don't know why, he just fits roles like that really well. He's got one of those faces that always seems to be deep in thought, and is clearly not someone who easily fits in with the mainstream. He's very good at conveying emotion, from extreme sadness to gleeful happiness, and interestingly one of his best scenes is one in which he's drunk. Alfred Molina is also very good as the anthropologist, a very different role from the one he may now be better known for in Spiderman 2. There is a young actor named Michelle Williams who gives a wonderful performance as Sil, the human form of the alien, as a young girl, effectively portraying her fear of her sterile surroundings. Once she turns into the blonde bombshell that is Natasha Henstridge, the majority of the rest of the film is concerned with her burning desire to mate and create babies and with everyone else's growing desire to stop her before they lose containment even more completely. One thing that I found interesting about the movie was the locations. It was filmed mostly on location in Hollywood and the Santa Monica area, which is where I live, so it was interesting to see all of these street locations that I know so well. I found it a bit odd, though, that in one scene Michael Madsen's character reads Dr. Baker's (his romantic interest in the film) home address, which is a real address in Simi Valley. My grandparents live in Simi Valley, and over the Thanksgiving holiday this year I decided to ride my bike by the house that was mentioned in the movie. It's just some house, in case you were wondering, but the address is real.There are some strange scenes in the movie, such as the one where they find the crashed car that Sil was in, find the tip of one of her thumbs in the car, and assume that she's dead. What do they figure happened to the rest of her body? Vaporized? There is some great poetic justice, you might say, in her choice of a mate, but my favorite part of the movie was the part at the end when the woman wonders which half of Sil, the human or the alien, was the predatory half. Pretty interesting question about humanity, although a bit jarring to have come from what is at best a second rate science fiction film.

A beautiful but consumptive Parisian courtesan finds true unselfish love with an idealistic young man. I can't think where I've heard that one before. 'Moulin Rouge!' is set in the famous nightclub in 1899\/1900. Christian, an aspiring young English writer falls in love with Satine, a courtesan who is also the Moulin Rouge's most famous dancer. (Just how she manages to dance so energetically even though she is dying of consumption is never explained). Christian has a rival for Satine's affections in the shape of an evil but immensely wealthy Duke. Anyone who has read 'La Dame aux Camellias' can work out the rest. The film is not intended to be a period piece or an attempt to recreate the atmosphere of fin-de-siecle Paris. Although the era had its own very distinctive musical culture, some of which is still familiar today thanks to films such as 'Can-Can' or the original 'Moulin Rouge' from the fifties, Baz Luhrmann took the decision to ignore this, using modern pop music instead, so we get the characters singing along to the likes of 'One Day I'll Fly Away', Madonna's 'Like a Virgin' or David Bowie's 'Diamond Dogs'. The idea was presumably to make something unorthodox and to get away from the traditional Hollywood musical. While I can appreciate Luhrmann's ambition to try something unconventional, I did not appreciate the result. Both Nicole Kidman as Satine and Ewan McGregor as Christian did their own singing, but although Kidman's voice is pleasant enough I felt that neither of them have strong enough singing voices to take the leading roles in a film musical. The old system whereby professional singers were often hired to dub the voices of star-name actors had a lot to be said for it. The set-piece choral numbers, by contrast, tended to sound harsh and strident. If the film sounded bad, it looked even worse. The sets and costumes looked cheap and tacky, the colours were garish and the camera-work must have been done by someone on an acid trip. Ditto the editing. The acting is defiantly and quite deliberately over the top, the worst offender being Jim Broadbent whose performance as Harold Zidler, the owner of the Moulin Rouge, must rate as one of the most manic displays of overacting ever seen. Kidman and McGregor are only slightly better; I was left quite unmoved by the pathos of the young lovers' plight. With its strident music, garish colours and hectic visuals, this film is the cinematic equivalent of a migraine attack. Those who see it as a triumph of style over substance are being too charitable. Certainly, there is little substance here, but nobody could call this loud, vulgar, tasteless and self-satisfied film stylish except those who confuse tawdry glitz with style. 3\/10.

Branagh not only directs this rich and visually stunning film, he stars as the title character. The movie opens with Derek Jacobi (Branagh's Shakespearean mentor) in modern garb passionately delivering the prologue. Then we are taken into the dark, dank rooms of Henry's castle. The king makes his dramatic entrance, complete with a Darth Vader style cape. The entire film is filled with grandeur and pomp, with any faults in the story line being attributable more to Shakespeare himself than Branagh. Henry V as I remember it from my college English class is a decidingly pro-British play (and film). There is little question that France should be conquered, and Henry speaks of his war against France as if it were France that attacked England. Indeed, Henry's famous St. Chrispin's day speech is so rousing, that it has been quoted often and inspired the name of the Band of Brothers miniseries about World War II. This is no surprise, since Shakespeare's prose is famously beautiful.There is definitely a difference in the way that both sides of the conflict are presented. The French, at least in Branagh's movie are presented as arrogant (and somewhat effeminate), while on the side of the English, even children are filled with manly courage. Henry is presented as noble, fair, and merciful. True he threatens the mayor of one French town, telling him that if he does not surrender the town, the English will do terrible things to its residents, but does not carry out his threat. He also hangs the one English soldier who steals from a French church, refusing to show favoritism for him just because he was his friend. Apparently mercy towards your own countrymen was not a virtue that Henry saw particularly important.The films greatest attribute is its soundtrack, particularly the use of music in the scene following the battle of Agincourt in which the warring parties collect their dead for burial.All in all, a fascinating look inside the mind of a king.

Apparently, Tarantino liked the short so much that he cast Jones in Pulp Fiction and produced a full length version of Curdled with Jones and William Baldwin (who is surprisingly great.) This is one of my favorite black comedies and easily the funniest serial killer thriller ever. Angela Jones lights up the screen with her animated facial expressions (think Audrey Tautou) and quirky delivery. Oh, and this movie features one of the best dance sequences in a movie (yes, even better than Britt Ekland's in The Wicker Man). The recently released DVD is a blessing and surprisingly chockful of extras (including the original short film) for a movie that is apparently so reviled. The worst thing I can say about Curdled is that Braddock didn't go on to make another film and Jones went on to do a freakin Children of the Corn sequel.

Angela Jones lights up the screen with her animated facial expressions (think Audrey Tautou) and quirky delivery. Oh, and this movie features one of the best dance sequences in a movie (yes, even better than Britt Ekland's in The Wicker Man). The recently released DVD is a blessing and surprisingly chockful of extras (including the original short film) for a movie that is apparently so reviled. The worst thing I can say about Curdled is that Braddock didn't go on to make another film and Jones went on to do a freakin Children of the Corn sequel. Recommend to all fans of serial killer movies and dark comedies.

It is based on a short made in 1991, about a childlike murder-obsessed Colombian-American who takes a job as a maid...who cleans up after violent murders.

Every time I watch this movie I see something new. I would call this perfect. And then 7 Oscar Nominations and the place here at IMDb top 250 speaks for it self I think.I am gonna give my comment on it anyways.First of all the movie is based on a novel by Stephen King, one of my favorite writers. Some of his books have become terrible movies, while some of them are classics. Movies like The Green Mile, Stand By Me, The Shining etc, they are all classics, and this one just stand out to be the best of them all.Secondly the actors. Morgan Freeman who never does a bad job in a movie, and if it wasn't for Forest Gump that came out the same year, I am sure he would have been winning best Actor that year at the Oscars. Same goes for Tim Robbins, another class actor, and here he really is at his best. Actually, I cant find any actor making a bad job in this movie, not even small roles from supporting characters.The sound track might not be the most exciting, but it for sure really suits the movie, and does not spoil any of the dialogs. The cutting, and the way the movie is filmed is also one of the best I ever seen.In the beginning there is a court where Andy Duofrense played by Tim Robbins try to claim his innocence after his wife have been murdered. Even if he is innocence all proves against him and he get judged to prison. It all start out with the new prisoners arriving. Andy Duofrense is one of those, and he seem to be one who does not seem to be bothered about being in a prison, cause he walk around like he was a free bird who could leave his cage whenever he wants.Eventually Andy and Red(Morgan Freeman) becomes friends, and Red is the guy in the prison who can fix everything. So Andy asks Red to fix a poster and a small hammer for him. That is eventually the key to freedom..There is a lot of lovely scenes in this movie. Like when Andy managed to get his prisoner m8's beer while they are fixing the roof.I ain't gonna say more about this movie, cause it really is one long lovely story, and you have to see it.I rate this 10\/10, and it is the perfect movie, and the only movie I rated 10!

I think that Nicole Kidman is really impressive and I was surprised by her fascinating voice when singing. The rhythm of the movie is frenetic and the scene of the 'can can' is 'spectacular spectacular'. For me it is the story of the most impressive love match since Romeo and Juliet, and the tragic end instantly brings to mind the story of the Lovers of Verona. The real highlight among the well-known songs in the film occurs when a duet is performed By Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor. In fact, I much prefer Ewan's version of Elton John's Your Song. I always liked it but now I love it. I went out of the cinema enthralled and I have seen the DVD loads of times. It is the perfect movie to see in good company, and to cry with emotion.
