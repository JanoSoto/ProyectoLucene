This is just a gorgeous movie, with color contrasts that remind me of the MGM fantasy musicals of the 40s and 50s like The Pirate and some of the best matte work you will ever see -- all of these expensive effects are raised to a higher level by director Terry Gilliam's unique sense of proportion and his skills in animation. One of the more striking aspects of Gilliam's art is that he's one of the few directors to work in fantasy\/sci-fi films in the last 30 years who has a really unique and identifiable visual sensibility that if anything is enhanced by rather than smoothed out by the effects work. Taken as a whole (story and visuals) I think it's one of the most entertaining and intelligent fantasy films ever made.John Neville makes a striking central figure as the Baron Munchausen, a figure of legend come to life in the setting of an apocalyptic battle between a German city and the Turkish army. Sarah Polley's performance is far better than Craig Warnock's in Time Bandits, and it's particularly interesting now in light of Gilliam's announcement that his inner child is a little girl (on the DVD for Tideland). There's so much of Gilliam in the character -- she is at the same time the most realistic and practical person on the mission who must remind the Baron constantly of the purpose of the mission and yet she is also the one with the most irrepressible belief in fantasy. Eric Idle's work is really exceptional in this film also; he has a unique way of saying his lines that just always brings me a laugh, like the way he says oh, all right after the Baron admits that he abandoned him on the moon and only came to rescue him because he needed him. He brings the Python sensibility to this movie that matches so well with Gilliam's style. Oliver Reed and Uma Thurman also did great work in their section of the movie. I've never been hugely into Robin Williams' performance here, much too broad as usual as if he was working for Blake Edwards, though his work was better when he and Gilliam did Fisher King a few years later so maybe he just needed some time to adjust to the pace and proportion of Gilliam's world.Gilliam has said that this movie forms a loose trilogy with Time Bandits and Brazil, those films dealing with fantasy\/reality in the eyes of children and adults respectively and Munchausen closing the cycle by exploring the role of fantasy in the lives of people who are aging into the last stages of life. That's clear enough from the film, and it's also interesting how he uses the opportunity to satirically comment on the whole concept of modernity and the scientific revolution, much in the tradition of Swift's masterpiece Gulliver's Travels. Not having read the original Munchausen book I can't say how much of that is from the book and how much is from the film, but it does tie in rather strongly to the anti-bureaucratic perspective of Brazil (Jonathan Pryce even plays a character who could be said to symbolize the connection). It's interesting that Gilliam is so attracted to these types of characters who sort of cling to the romantic past and refuse to recognize rationalism -- in addition to Brazil he also has attempted several times to make a post-modern Don Quixote film. His brilliant Tideland shows how fantasy could be a more effective escape from trauma than reality, and his Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a heart-felt tribute to the idealism and hope of the 60s youth movement that was crushed by the cynicism and reality of the 1970s. There's a beautiful speech that Hunter Thompson wrote for the book which Gilliam really latched onto and emphasized, where he talks about the place where the wave finally broke and rolled back. I think Baron Munchausen is about the same moment but in a broader sense of the domination of science and rationalism over the ancient world of wonder and significance. Munchausen laments there is no place in the modern world for oceans made of wine -- his sadness is not just for our culture losing its ability to believe in dreams but also on a more personal level as an old man who no longer believes in his own dream.On a totally separate note, I'd like to just mention a few elements of this film that J.K. Rowling has paid tribute to in her instant-classic Harry Potter fantasy series. First of all there is the image of death as a hooded reaper, a fairly generic image but in this case we see death removing Baron Munchausen's soul as a glowing orb through his mouth just as the dementors do in the Potter books. There's also Jon Pryce's character, mayor Jackson, who reminds my girlfriend and I very much of Lucius Malfoy -- in very much the same way he rails against exceptional people who go out on a limb to help others, and Rowling has even lifted Jackson's line about such people facing a very sticky end. Of course the depiction of Potter's family and neighborhood are also very reminiscent of Time Bandits and Rowling is a vocal Gilliam fan -- she advocated him as director for the Potter films but the producers never took her seriously... a shame because most of them lack the rare kind of imagination and humor that Rowling and Gilliam share.

I purchased this 2-disc DVD for the princely sum of 6 Euro, having wanted to see it for a long time. I was a little surprised to see it on the IMDb's top 250 list at number 18. A very high placing indeed. The opening scene at the railway station is great. A little slow for some people but I loved it. The creaking of the windmill, the fly on Elam's face, the inevitable shoot-out are all fantastically done. Nobody but Leone would have got away with that amount of time seemingly wasted on the introduction. If any other filmmaker had tried it - they would be slapped down as a pretentious showboater. The next big set-piece is good also - Henry Fonda's character gunning down an entire family as they prepared a banquet celebration. But - for me - the downward spiral starts from here onwards.The music is good, the characters are okay and Cardinale is certainly easy on the eye. But the plot, storyline and general story-telling is so muddled and disjointed that I was left very unsatisfied. Also, the character of Jason Robards is a strange one and to me, unneeded. What value did he bring to the story? None as far as I can see. Sure, Fonda used his trademark long duster coats as cover for the murders - but other than that - I cannot see what his role is. And as for his relationship with Harmonica, whom he meets in a bar, saves from a train and then ends up dying next to him, it is puzzling in the extreme. Harmonica and Cheyenne seem to have no connection to each other but yet Cheyenne goes out of his way to help him??? Curious???Also - there are some scenes which I could not comprehend. Cardinale's bedroom scene with Frank? What? Also Frank meeting Morton in a desert hideaway? What? And both of these scenes practically follow each other. Makes no sense at all.The final showdown is okay - but lacks a bit of tension for me. However, the extreme close-up of Bronson's eyes adds a point to the film's score on it's own. Very impressive.To me the film suffered from having too many main characters and not enough for any of them to do. You had Cardinale, Fonda, Bronson and Robards all vying for story-time when in reality one (or possibly two) of them needed to be culled. Too muddled and too confusing. And there is a lot of posturing going on too - people staring at each other wordlessly - must have happened 10 times throughout the movie. But the style and the music win it a 7\/10 score for me.

When you're young as I was when I watched this, you don't get adult humor and seeing dinosaurs tear people apart can be a little scary.

(Well, Airplane and the evil toilet scene from Look Who's Talking Too kinda scared me too, so it ain't saying much now is it?) First of all forgot how faked the little raptor thing looked! And of course the humor in it as well Seriously, was that hippie stoned when he said Peace, Green Brother to the Raptor? Personally I would have said Ah crap but maybe that's just me. And the hero does deliver a good action movie one liner with I hate wildlife before killing the T-Rex. Very repeatable line there. Oh and this movie was my first exposure to Alfred E. Neuman as well. But the movie does have it's dark moments, such as Diane Ladd (whose daughter starred in the other dinosaur flick that came out around the time this did. Can you guess who she is and what movie it is?) as the evil bioengineer who thinks humans don't deserve the planet and dinosaurs do. Wow, did she wake up on the wrong side of the bed or what? And wait till you find out what the fever is.My only beef with this movie is the middle (or maybe it's not the middle, I can never keep track with 80 minute movies sometimes) where our hero confronts Ladd about what she's doing. It seems she took a little too long to explain her side of the story. I mean, he gets inside, holds her at gunpoint. Next scene it's morning, Sheriff is preparing breakfast, then the next it's night when B Movie king Clint Not Ron Howard has his head bitten off, then cut back to the hero still holding Ladd at gunpoint. Dude, you have a gun. Make her give you answers immediately, no matter how cold hearted she is! Seems he was a little too patient.So, while it's not the scariest movie ever that I thought it was at 8 years old, it's still a fun campy horror movie just not meant to be taken seriously.

In a nod to the original we see Jack Carter on a train travelling to his hometown to find out who killed his brother. But although in the original it made sense that Jack would be taking a train ride, here I can't help but wonder why Carter just didn't take a plane. Surely someone who has mob connections and a high income would rather fly to Seattle from Las Vegas. But no, the film wants to pay homage to the original, even though all the time it's urinating on its head.One of the most shocking things about this Get Carter is how toothless it is. The original is a gritty, relentlessly violent tale of retribution. This on the other hand is a limp revenge tale full of self-growth. I really wanted to vomit during the scene where Carter and his niece talk things over and help one another grow as human beings. Yes, mobsters make great self-help gurus and grief counsellors. What's that, you father's dead and you starred in a sleazy bit of porno? Don't worry, Uncie Carter the murderer will make everything better. There, there child.But one of the most unforgivable things is the casting of Alan Cumming. Sure I can never truly hate him as he was Boris in GoldeEye, but every single performance since then has been awful. He's just incapable of being anything other than a cartoon. And while that might be appropriate for X-Men or a Bond movie, it certainly doesn't fit with a supposedly gritty crime thriller. I mean, there's a scene at the end when Carter is going to kill him where he's wearing a bucket hat &#150; one of the film's main villains looks like Reni out of The Stone Roses. And during the scene at the end he cries like a girl, his voice becoming so high-pitched that he must have had several clipboard clips attached to his testicles. Just shoot him, I begged Stallone. But no, Carter makes this simpering fool get on his knees and then unloads a magazine beyond his head before telling the moron that he's going to give him a second chance. Screw that. Splatter his brains all over the ground.Compare this compassion to the original where Carter kills everyone who gets in his way. All of the people who were complicit in his brother's death are ruthlessly despatched. Plus there's the possibility that his brother's daughter is in fact Carter's daughter, as he was sleeping with his brother's wife. So there are quite a few different levels to the story and there's quite a bit of ambiguity. But here everything is very simple. Doreen is definitely Carter's niece and Carter doesn't have a sexual relationship with his brother's wife. Carter deep down is just a decent guy trying to right a wrong. Yawn.And because the film is far more simplistic, many of the important scenes fall flat. For instance, there's the scene where Carter finds out that his niece was involved in a porno movie. You have jagged editing and then later you see Stallone driving his car as the camera moves upside down (his world has been turned upside down&#133;get it?). But it has zero emotion. Compare this to the original where Carter stumbles upon a porno movie after shagging some broad. At first he enjoys it, but then when he sees that Doreen is involved, a girl who might be his daughter, his enjoyment turns to tears. You very briefly see a glimpse of humanity. But then he explodes in rage and you know everything is going to end badly.But the remake doesn't end badly for the characters. Apparently revenge isn't a messy game. In fact, it makes everything okay. And then once it's done, everyone can get on with their lives. We even see Stallone drive off into the sunset. It's the complete antithesis of the Caine film.Speaking of Caine, he turns up as the bad guy in this film. But I don't know whether his taking part in this movie is an endorsement or he's having a laugh. I'd like to think he's trying to show everyone how inferior this movie is, but in reality it was probably just an easy paycheque. But seeing Stallone and Caine together reminds you of how inferior Sly is. Caine's Carter was a tough everyman, a bloke who had a mentality of a cobra. Stallone's Carter, though, is a beefy wimp, an idiot in a shiny suit who speaks in catchphrases. A couple times he tells people he's taking things to the next level. But unfortunately for Sly his film never gets off the ground.

The scenario One guy watches one really terrible film, thinks its the greatest thing he has ever seen and then never writes another comment in their life. Sound fishy? Or how about the guy who only seems to give 10 stars to the worst movies? Never bothers to rate anything other than new bad films and never gives them anything less than 10?! Its pretty laughable.

The only nods to that condition I saw were the Army soldiers happily on the streets, the Buy Bonds sticker over teller window, and the snippet of a TOJO headline on a library newspaper. But the war wasn't lost on Hitchcock, who'd had years of it in Britain and Europe.He was telling us, through the treatment of the towns, and the lead characters, that our small-town innocence was about to be ravished by what was REALLY going on in the world.Uncle Charlie is a metaphor for the evil that is out there, that we assume will never assault our protected, insulated lives.

She is not starry-eyed, but centered -- after all, she very maturely reacts to the detective's proposal.

This film, which I consider one of the greatest ever made, is the story of young Prince Ashitaka. While defending his tribe from a rampaging demon, he is infected with its' venomous hate. The infection is lethal, and the only hope for Ashitaka is to leave his ancestral lands, venture into the west, see what caused the entity that attacked his people to turn into a demon, and to see with eyes unclouded by hate. His journey takes him to Irontown, a village of miners and metalworkers, and their struggle with the Great Forest Spirit. At that point, it becomes a moral fable about how humans coexist (or more often, fail to) with the natural environment and the price that they pay for trying to control the elements of nature. It's a tremendously fast-paced and exciting story, full of strong and well-rounded characters voiced convincingly by the likes of Billy Crudup, Claire Danes, Gillian Anderson, Minnie Driver, Jada Pinkett-Smith and Billy Bob Thornton.

Now, I don't give a big one what your politics are, but I remember telling this gal that I was old enough to remember the assassinations of JFK and RFK and MLK, and that her shirt was disgusting.Well, you can imagine the joyful noise that came out of her mouth--fascist pig, Republican, hater--you get the picture. She stormed off and I got a dirty look from my date. Was it worth it? Yup.I finally sat down a few weeks ago to watch Thelma and Louise, the hugely popular renegade movie by Ridley Scott. I found it just about as offensive as that gal's shirt, but not because it was a two-hour insult to men (we need a good insult every once in awhile!). I just found it numbingly stupid.Now, stupid is one of the most over-used words in the English language, but about the thirtieth time Louise (or was it Thelma?) made a decision that edged the two gal-pals closer to a fiery disaster, I just gave up trying to explain away the dumb choices and started muttering stupid! TAL is such a lazy movie! Scott tries again and again to infuse meaning to excuse stupidity, background music to replace logic, and cigarette smoking to demand for the principals the respect they deserve. If you look closely, Thelma and Louise is more style than anything close to substance. Gunplay and dirty faces replace any deep understanding of just how damaged the two main characters really are; it's infuriating and wasteful.Which brings back the memory of the gal at the Gorge.

Kurosawa is probably my favorite all time director, but I have found that some of his 2+ hour movies tend to get a little long in the tooth before all is said and done (excepting the superb Seven Samurai.) However, I was pleasantly surprised. This film is a delight. I was truly moved by the story of the cynical young doctor who gradually learns to care for his patients, under the tutelage of a stern but caring elder, played by Mifune. The first major death scene is truly extraordinary, and is surely on the short list of Kurosawa's most memorable ( the music plays loudly as a sick man lifts his head up one last time. He is in a dark room but the light shines on his face at that moment. It is magnificent.) I think Mifune was very capable as the elder doctor, and I disagree with Steven Prince's commentary, in which he claimed that Shimura would have done a better job with certain scenes, in particular one where the doctor is (unsuccessfully) trying to give a young child medicine. For sure, Shimura would have been more natural at it, but that was part of the charm, that Mifune was playing against type, and that the doctor himself had to make an effort to tamp down his enormous energies and tap into his caring side. The second half of the film is dominated by the young doctor, a young girl, and an even younger boy, as Mifune virtually disappears. However, it continues to fascinate, as we track the young doctor's immersion with a single patient, who in turn regains her humanity by caring for him when he is sick, and helping the young (hungry) boy in his desperate situation.In short, I cannot recommend this film highly enough, esp. for the Kurosawa admirer. Perhaps Ikiru, Akahige, and Ran, are respectively Kurosawa's three most comprehensive statements about man as a whole (although all his films are about the state of man alone and with others, Rashomon, High and Low, I Live in Fear for example), and Akahige, I believe, is his peak in terms of his humanistic vision of what man is capable of and can evolve to be. This is his last film with Mifune, as is well known. A fitting statement for both men, although it would have been interesting to see what Mifune could have done as Hidetora in Ran.

It's a direct movie descendant of Alien and The Haunting. Sam Neill is, once again, excellent as the designer\/builder of the Event Horizon, the greatest achievement of his career that he cannot enjoy because he's wracked by the guilty knowledge that all the time he spent on it cost him the love and life of his wife, Claire. The ship, equipped with some fancy dimension-warping black hole drive, has returned after having disappeared seven years before, God knows where. It's never quite clear, but it seems to be either a dimension of pure destructive chaos or even Hell itself. Each crew-member's hidden fears and guilt are preyed upon by whatever it is that now inhabits the ship. Yes, there is blood and gore (plenty of it!), but this movie gives us chills thru the astounding ship sets (it looks like something wrenched from a Gothic cathedral), clever use of light and darkness, and the feeling that there's something either behind you or right next to you, watching you all the time. It's creepy and disturbing, all the way to the end. One of my all-time favorites.
