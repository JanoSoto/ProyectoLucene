The only one who fully understands the film is Fellini, and well we all know where he is! 3. This film is a comedy... only problem is it's a different style of comedy, fitted towards the particular culture. Since I have zero Italian blood in me, certain things have gone over my head. 4. For those not assosciated with Fellini, this film is very surrealistic. It jumps between reality, fantasy, imagination, past, and God knows where else. This was in fact my first introduction to Fellini and since seeing his other films, have been surprised at just how radical this film is. Anyway, just a heads up to people who haven't seen the film, on to a brief review. 5. This film is from a director's eye. It will cut away from a plot line to give a close up to a random person just to focus in on them or give them a few lines. As an aspiring director, I found this strangely relatable. The entire film feels quirky and frantic, much like the mind of a creator.Mastroianni's performance was stellar. A character both different and exactly the same as the one in La Dolce Vita. With wit and cynicism he travels with us on this strange journey. This was one of the first black and white films I've seen where I never felt like I was watching a black and white film. It is filmed in such a vivid and passionate way you never feel bored! Certain scenes are meant to wow you or shock you. A controversial scene that has something to do with a whip (no spoilers!) makes you feel filled with pathos, laughter, anger, and confusion all at the same time! That is much like this film, which fills you with odd, contrasting emotions that offer no simple answers and ask you to choose which ones to act upon.

However, I don't think that the creators of this movie do. Right off the bat, the movie features an event that never happens in the book. That's a bad sign right there.I also did not like the acting. I suppose Johnathan Thomas was alright as Tom Sawyer, but I did not like the roles of Huck, Injun Joe, or Becky Thatcher. The performances that these actors gave were bland and totally non-believable.The thing I hated the MOST though, was the movie's sheer stupidity.

The movie was written by television comedy writer Larry Gelbart and directed by TV icon Carl Reiner. John Denver, in his first acting role, plays the character who talks to God and has to convince everyone that he exists. There aren't really any huge laughs in this movie, but it has some funny parts and the movie and it's message are just genuinely appealing. The idea that a normal guy can be chosen by God to spread his simple message to the world is something we want to believe in. Denver's character is an assistant manager at a supermarket when he gets a letter to meet God for an interview on the 27th floor of a building that only has 17 floors.

Dalton has a look around the Double Deuce & sees nothing but the wrong sort of client, barmen who steal the takings & security men who like to have sex in the storeroom. Dalton realises he has a big job on his hands but slowly manages to turn the bar around from a rundown pit full of scum to a classy upmarket joint that people come from miles around th get inside. Tilghman is happy as his bar is making lots of money & is now respectable but local gangster Brad Wesley (Ben Gazzara) sets his sights on Dalton when he stands up to Wesley's thugs & extortion, people get beat up & things explode as Dalton takes Wesley & his goons down...Directed by Rowdy Herrington this has to be one of the gayest action films of the 80's, it's total camp from start to finish with so much unintentional humour & homosexual vibes that Road House really is one of those so bad it's good films. Lets look at the evidence. For a start whether it was intentional or not Patrick Swayze spends most of Road House without a shirt on, he swims topless, he gets treated in hospital topless, one of his final fights is topless, he trains topless (covered in sweat too), he does his Tai-Chi exercises topless, he has a row with his girlfriend topless & the list goes on & even when he isn't topless he's wearing tight fitting shirts that show off all his curves if you know what I mean. Coincidence? I think not. Also even for an action film there are too many kicks & punches to guy's groins to not arouse some suspicion that the makers were dick-lovers & really wanted to focus on male bodies & what makes them masculine. I mean all the fights in which the bad guy's grapple & hold Swayze are impossible to ignore. Road House just loves being masculine, the bar fights, the nudity, the soundtrack, the polite bouncers who can still kick ass & every attempt at serious drama just falls flat & becomes hilarious. The script takes itself very seriously but everything it does just accentuates the camp & the whole gay subtext. The dialogue is also unintentionally funny, classics like 'nobody ever wins a fight', 'pain don't hurt', 'I want you to be nice until it's time not to be nice' & 'I hears you had balls big enough to come in a dump truck' (another subtle gay reference?) will have you laughing in all the wrong places. At 110 minutes long Road House goes on longer than it should & has a sort of strange fragmented story, the first third is all about Dalton cleaning up the Double Deuce, then the middle third is about a relationship Dalton has with a Doctor & finally the Brad Wesley subplot comes to the fore during the final forty odd minutes after Dalton has turned the Double Deuces into a top night spot all on his own.For an action film there's not much action, sure the bar room brawl's are OK but hardly amazing & apart from two big explosions there's not much else. The best scene involves one of those trucks with huge wheels crashing through a car dealership & crushing all the cars as it drives over them but the sole highlight really. The whole film seems shot with bright neon colours dominating, from the bright & garish late 80's fashions to the neon signs & bright decor. The late Patrick Swayze had huge hits with Dirty Dancing (1987) & Ghost (1990) with Road House one of three films he made between them although it wasn't a big success at the time.With a supposed budget of about $19,000,000 I can now see why there aren't more big action set-pieces, there wasn't the money. Filmed in Valencia in California. The acting is bad, everyone tries to out macho each other & it's quite amusing at times watching actor's say totally gay lines of dialogue straight & try to make it sound dramatic.Road House is a camp classic, it's so bad it's good but not good for the reasons it wants to be. Sit down & just enjoy Road House for what it, a silly action film that is just plain camp & silly.

Perhan's journey with his winged sunbird takes him to a place where the loving family support he was once used to is replaced with the harsh reality of life. This journey causes him to change drastically, making him into the person he wasn't meant to be. The symbolism, repetition, and cycles that persist throughout the film are what I enjoyed the most about it. The accordion he plays at both happy and devastating times, the portrayal of Azra as both trust and betrayal, the duplication of the starting conflict as the ending conflict, the cycle carried out by Perhan's son, and many other elements of the story are what turn this from a simplistic tale of love and revenge, to a complex cultural tragedy that leaves the final interpretations up to the viewer. I was not sure whether I felt sorry for or hated Perhan by the end of this film, and finally concluded that it's best to just see him as a human being, for we all make mistakes and change as we try to discover the path we wish to take in life.

Hard drinking and soon to be divorced, Latimer flies of the handle when he spies his ex out having a drink in a bar with another man. Up before the school board, who have tired of his combustible attitude, Latimer is informed that he has finally got the Principal position he has long since courted. Trouble is is that it is at Brandel High, a notoriously troubled school where violence and crime are part of the curriculum. Taking up an attitude of fighting fire with fire and working from his motto of No More, Latimer hopes to bring order and respect to the school. But with only Security guard Jake Phillips (Louis Gossett Jr) as an ally and the thuggish school kingpin Victor Duncan (Michael Wright) after his blood, Latimer will do well to just survive the first week.The formula of such movies like The Principal is now seen as old hat, post the release of Christopher Cain's movie you can trace a line from Lean On Me in 1989, to The Substitute 1996 and on to One Eight Seven the following year. Prior to The Principal the topic is a bit more thin on the ground, we can probably laud the excellent Blackboard Jungle from 1955, while 1984 saw Mark L. Lester tap into the video nasty zeitgeist of the early 80s with his trashy Classs Of 1984. So plenty of film's, and similar types like Stand And Deliver, from which to choose should you require a night in with a teacher intent on straightening out those ruffians; whilst ensuring the good kids get the education they deserve. So why choose The Principal then?Well James Belushi's fans don't need much convincing here, an always likable star who knows the limits of his talents, the film gives him the chance to mix serious drama with his comedy bent. This played out with immeasurable cool too. Latimer is one bad ass teacher, he drinks hard, plays hard, whirls his baseball bat and rides a motorcycle. He's no Dolph Lungdren (Detention) or a Tom Berrenger (The Substitute), but Belushi can carry off the tough side of Latimer, whilst showing his fallibility's via little comedy moments as he wonders just what the hell he is doing here. Belushi is admirably supported by Gossett Jr, a believable tough security guard if ever there was one, while a lot of the film's strength is drawn from the developing relationship between the two men. Of the rest of the cast it's Michael Wright who stands out as head thug Victor. Already at the time of release a cult actor thanks to his turn in The Wanderers, Wright is supremely cool and terrifying into the bargain. When he shouts I expel you, you start to pack your bags, that is unless you are Principal Latimer of course.As ever with a film of this type there are complaints that it's full of stereotypes, but were they in 1987? Director Cain is for sure not addressing the then fledgling problems of education and crime amongst African-American and Latino school kids. But he is not shying away from the issue either. That the most unsavoury point in the film sees a white youth perpetrate crime on a black teacher tends to get over looked by snarky PC critics. Make no bones about it tho, this is more macho than the rest, again this is something that has upset many a critic who prefers the reach out to the kids approach in something like Morgan Freeman's excellent, but tonally different, Lean On Me. Oh yes sir, this is taking a different tack, but I for one appreciate having a different angle from which to view such subject matter. Some hooligans can be saved by reaching out to them, but lets not kid ourselves that some of them don't need more than just a telling off from The Principal. Yes the film is also very 80s, none more so than with the soundtrack where we get a mix of the bad; some American Heartbeat sounding fluffer, and the great; Strafe's pulse rocking Set It Off. Not setting out to win awards or moralise about an ongoing problem, The Principal goes for a tough and gritty approach for this semester.

When he shouts I expel you, you start to pack your bags, that is unless you are Principal Latimer of course.As ever with a film of this type there are complaints that it's full of stereotypes, but were they in 1987? Director Cain is for sure not addressing the then fledgling problems of education and crime amongst African-American and Latino school kids. But he is not shying away from the issue either. That the most unsavoury point in the film sees a white youth perpetrate crime on a black teacher tends to get over looked by snarky PC critics. Make no bones about it tho, this is more macho than the rest, again this is something that has upset many a critic who prefers the reach out to the kids approach in something like Morgan Freeman's excellent, but tonally different, Lean On Me. Oh yes sir, this is taking a different tack, but I for one appreciate having a different angle from which to view such subject matter. Some hooligans can be saved by reaching out to them, but lets not kid ourselves that some of them don't need more than just a telling off from The Principal. Yes the film is also very 80s, none more so than with the soundtrack where we get a mix of the bad; some American Heartbeat sounding fluffer, and the great; Strafe's pulse rocking Set It Off. Not setting out to win awards or moralise about an ongoing problem, The Principal goes for a tough and gritty approach for this semester. Amen to that sir. 8\/10 ","genre":"Action, Crime, Drama"},{"date":"9 June 2010","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" The 1980's was a incredible decade for movies even for bad movies like this. I look back to it and think that even the trashiest movies of that decade were not as bad as many movies that appeared in the 1990's and in 2000's. This is a classic example of a bad movie that you might enjoy it and might think well it's not that bad and it's quite enjoyable. Who's that Girl is a silly mix between Something Wild (released in 1986), Bringing Up Baby (1938), and perhaps more movies where a crazy girl disturbs the peace of a quiet man creating nothing but trouble and in the end they realize that they love each other.In James Foley's film Madonna plays a ex-convict recently released out of jail who wants to clean her name and put behind bars the responsible for her detaining. Griffin Dunne plays a correct lawyer who's taking care of the preparatives of his wedding when his father-in-law (John McMartin) gives to him a mission that involves the ex-convict simply make sure that the girl get into the bus to Philadelphia. Simple as that if wasn't the fact that she's a devil in person always with an innocent smile on the face, letting the poor guy crazy. Add to this a destructed and valuable car with a rare tiger named Murray in it (such a great animal actor) who is about to be delivered to a rich man (played by John Mills). The whole confusion of the beginning of the movie is irritating, obvious and very silly. It also includes the irritating little voice that Madonna needs to make to appear as a funny actress. She's very beautiful here but that didn't impeach her to have a terrible performance and win at the Razzie Awards. Plus the screenplay offers a variety of dumb characters (For instance two cops who are watching the girl's confusion but they don't make anything except get in the car or get out to car to lunch) and supposed to be funny situations that leads to nowhere if you think about what happens at the ending. I'm truly disappointed with this movie because director James Foley at the time just came out of a great movie called At Close Range a very powerful thriller with Sean Penn and Christopher Walken, and I think he needed a similar project instead of a cheap comedy like this. Gladly he recovered his talent in 1992 with his best film of all time Glengarry Glen Ross.This is not a completely bomb. It has a fine performance of Griffin Dunne (After Hours). And if most of the moments are not funny at all there are some of the dumbest lines ever. Quoting my favorite there's a scene between Griffin's bride (Havilland Morris) and Buck the muscular delivery boy (James Dietz, he's got some scary look in his eyes) during the failed wedding. She says You'll take care of me, won't you Buck? And he replies Of course I will. I'm very muscular. This dialog appears almost at the end of the movie and that was my only laughing in the whole thing. Still it worths 5 stars because once again the movies of the 1980's gives you a twinkle in the eye and I've seen worst movies than this. 5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"9 June 2010","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" The 1980's was a incredible decade for movies even for bad movies like this.

With a deadline imposed, the next full moon, and no clear leads, FBI chief Jack Crawford, with some desperation, pulls a retired agent out of the field.That retired agent is Will Graham (a compelling William Peterson) who is faced with the unenviable task of having to go and meet Dr Hannibal Lektor in order to try and gain some insight into the mind of the killer (the 'Tooth Fairy') they are chasing.For my money the scenes between Graham and Lektor are every bit as good (if not better) than those between Starling and Lector in Silence of the Lambs.The key difference here is that Michael Mann never allows the tension of fear to ebb away between Graham and Lektor. As Lektor (Brian Cox) sits on the edge of his bed, his dark eyes never moving from the young FBI agent, he is conversational, even pleasant with Graham. He talks about aftershave, and about various magazines. Then casually asks for Graham's home telephone number. Never has such an innocuous request been delivered with such underlying menace.As Graham and the FBI continue their hunt for the 'Tooth Fairy' ( a similarly impressive turn by Tom Noonan) it is Graham's growing mental turmoil which underpins the film. Reluctant at best to help his former colleagues, he is furious to find his wife and stepson targeted at one point, and as the clock ticks down toward the next full moon and the leads dry up one after another, you can sense the growing frustration build in Graham.

Contemptuous of the authorities which hold him behind bars, and mistrustful yet oddly respectful of his nemesis Graham, Cox's Lektor is a man with time to burn, and a score to settle.By contrast, the 'Tooth Fairy' is indeed a tortured soul. Resentful of society, and brutalised by a childhood which sadly the film does not touch on (for that you need the book), Tom Noonan brings depth and even sympathy to a character who has already murdered ten people before the film even starts.Better or worse than Silence of the Lambs, the comparison makes no difference to Manhunter.

Yah, F that.When I showed my friend this movie his first response was What does she see in him? I was surprised. I didn't get what he didn't get. Yah, he's flawed. THAT'S THE POINT. It's easy to love someone who's perfect---anyone can do that. But to love someone so terribly insecure, wounded, paranoid, irritable, and a million other things--? That takes real love. Layla isn't weak for loving such a person, she is incredibly strong. Real life romance requires people being able to conquer the bad in order to grow, and that's what the whole entire point of this movie.Layla and Billy face their own, individual challenges.Layla has the emotional and social intelligence that apparently some of the audience lacks. Right from the beginning, right after their rough introduction, she sees through to his vulnerability when he is talking on the phone at the dance studio, telling lies about how he's at an expensive hotel. There is a sudden, short cut to her listening in on the bathroom, with a sad look on her face. She can see by the things that he pretends to be what he really is. Because if someone puts on an act, logic follows that's not what they are really like. So she sees him acting tough and high status, and uses simple powers of deduction to conclude that he is really sensitive and insecure. She doesn't fall in love with what he does but what he hides. What is hidden is his true self, and she lets him show it to her. She begins to see deeper into the reasons for his behavior when she is at his parents house. She is trying to talk to his parents and is being completely ignored. She gives a brief crushed and sympathetic look to the camera (Billy's perspective) before turning her attention to the TV as his mother commands her to watch this play. She is extremely observant and knows how to give Billy a comfortable distance while simultaneously slowly coaxing him closer e.g. asking for a handshake and giving him a hug. Also when he indirectly confesses that he wasn't actually in a relationship with Wendy like he said he was, instead of calling him out or making him feel bad she asks afterward, Did you have any other girlfriends? This isn't the sign of a stupid, weak, one-dimensional character. She has a very contained personality, but she is the one who is more emotionally secure and stable, and acts as the rock that Billy never had. I thought it was all pretty obvious, but I guess if you're one-dimensional yourself, then yes, she's probably going to seem one-dimensional too.But the main focus is the challenge that Billy faces. While Layla is clear and upfront about her feelings, Billy has to struggle with a choice to act on anger, hate and hurt, and to take his own life, or to take the path of love, get rid of his deep rooted negativity, and embrace life. He is faced with this struggle up until the last 5-10 minutes of the film, when he is face to face with the man who represents all the awful things in his life, and debates whether or not to shoot him and then himself. Throughout the whole movie he periodically tries to make good on his plans, calling the club, checking to see what time Scott Woods comes in, and so on. He has to wait, and spends this time with Layla. After looking Scott Woods in the face, and letting go of everything bad, you see a complete transformation into a sweet and happy man who has let go of his demons and found a reason to live. Love kept him from killing himself. Really, how more romantic can you get? I think another thing people have missed is the fact that it's supposed to be funny. It's a darker sense of humor, which I could see not everyone getting. But you're not supposed to take character flaws so seriously; they're exaggerated for comedic effect.

The whole movie has a consistent feel to it The bland and muted colors used throughout the film give it an ugly-beauty sort of feel which is very accurate to Buffalo's charm.This movie doesn't spell out for the audience everything they should think and feel. You have to interpret and analyze not the words of the conversations, but what they're trying to convey about the dynamics between people. The characters, motivations, feelings, are not force-fed, and I prefer it that way. If you aren't able to digest deeper meanings in movie, and need direct dialog and formulaic characters, then you have no business snooping around in independent films in the first place. And the whole entire thing was contingent on the last few minutes. If you don't sit down a watch a whole movie, what are you doing rating and reviewing it? Anyway---the reason why this movie is so great is because it doesn't try to push the common delusions that romance is all fairy-tales and bunny tails, but instead examines what love really is.

I thought it was all pretty obvious, but I guess if you're one-dimensional yourself, then yes, she's probably going to seem one-dimensional too.But the main focus is the challenge that Billy faces. While Layla is clear and upfront about her feelings, Billy has to struggle with a choice to act on anger, hate and hurt, and to take his own life, or to take the path of love, get rid of his deep rooted negativity, and embrace life. He is faced with this struggle up until the last 5-10 minutes of the film, when he is face to face with the man who represents all the awful things in his life, and debates whether or not to shoot him and then himself. Throughout the whole movie he periodically tries to make good on his plans, calling the club, checking to see what time Scott Woods comes in, and so on. He has to wait, and spends this time with Layla. After looking Scott Woods in the face, and letting go of everything bad, you see a complete transformation into a sweet and happy man who has let go of his demons and found a reason to live. Love kept him from killing himself. Really, how more romantic can you get? I think another thing people have missed is the fact that it's supposed to be funny. It's a darker sense of humor, which I could see not everyone getting. But you're not supposed to take character flaws so seriously; they're exaggerated for comedic effect. And I want to say that I am from Buffalo, and he is dead on. I know people from Buffalo are mad at him, but come on, it's pretty much true. All the way from the houses covered in Bills merchandise to the annoying flat a in our accents which makes everyone else think we're Canadian. The whole movie has a consistent feel to it The bland and muted colors used throughout the film give it an ugly-beauty sort of feel which is very accurate to Buffalo's charm.This movie doesn't spell out for the audience everything they should think and feel. You have to interpret and analyze not the words of the conversations, but what they're trying to convey about the dynamics between people. The characters, motivations, feelings, are not force-fed, and I prefer it that way. If you aren't able to digest deeper meanings in movie, and need direct dialog and formulaic characters, then you have no business snooping around in independent films in the first place. And the whole entire thing was contingent on the last few minutes. If you don't sit down a watch a whole movie, what are you doing rating and reviewing it? Anyway---the reason why this movie is so great is because it doesn't try to push the common delusions that romance is all fairy-tales and bunny tails, but instead examines what love really is. Love isn't being rescued by Edward Cullen, it's being kidnapped by Billy Brown.

This film adaptation was released the year after the book and was also a success. Today, both the book and the movie are still hailed as classics. I recently finished reading the lengthy novel with the intention of watching this 1940 adaptation soon afterwards. Aware of its general reception, I was expecting a great film, better than both of the adaptations of Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men I had seen (the 1939 and 1992 versions). My expectations were definitely not exactly met. As much as I'm sure many would disagree, I don't think it lives up to the source material. I was still impressed, however.In Depression-era Oklahoma, Tom Joad has just been released from prison. He was sentenced to seven years for killing a man in a drunken brawl, but has been let out on parole after four years. On his way back to his family's farm, he meets Casy, a former preacher he used to know, who has since lost his faith. Together, they go to the Joad farm to find that it has been abandoned. Muley, a former neighbour, comes along and tells the two of them about the dust storms and how they have led to the eviction of farming families from their land! The Joads are now at Uncle John's place, and will soon be leaving for California, just like so many other farming families in the Dust Bowl are doing, including Muley's, but he refuses to leave Oklahoma. The next day, Tom and Casy go to Uncle John's farm, so Tom is reunited with his family (his parents, grandparents, siblings, and uncle). The Joads then begin their journey to California to search for employment, and take the former preacher with them on their truck. However, their destination may not be what they are expecting.Since I was expecting this to be a great film, I was expecting great acting, but unfortunately, I didn't see much of that. Henry Fonda's performance as Tom Joad is a memorable but flawed one, and this is clear from the scene where he first talks. Most of the other cast performances can probably be described the same way. Most of them aren't exactly bad, but Dorris Bowdon's performance as Rose of Sharon can be fairly poor, and the way Shirley Mills (Ruthie) says her lines can also be bad. Jane Darwell won an Oscar for the role of Ma Joad in this film, and her performance is probably better than most of the others here. There were times when I wasn't quite as moved as I felt I should have been, especially around the beginning, such as the part where Muley talks about losing his land. It just didn't seem convincing enough to me. However, I did find some parts more moving, especially later on, and found that maybe it got more intriguing after the Joads' arrival in California. For the most part, the film did hold my interest, with the story and the cinematography, though I also found that it ended too soon, leaving out too much of the novel, even though the movie is just over two hours long.After reading John Steinbeck's 1939 novel, it seemed to me that an excellent movie certainly could have been made out of it, and was convinced that this widely watched adaptation was it, but while many definitely think it is, I think it's overrated. However, overall, it is a good drama. Obviously, there are some differences between the novel and this adaptation. For much of the film, it closely follows the book (though obviously not everything is included), but takes more liberties later on. Also, some parts of the book obviously couldn't have been done in Hollywood in 1940, including the ending. This was long before the fall of Hays Code. Still, despite the differences, I would say this adaptation of The Grapes of Wrath is worth watching if you like the book (or maybe if you haven't read the book but like movies from this era), though you obviously COULD find yourself somewhat disappointed, maybe even severely disappointed, even if most people who have seen it haven't been disappointed at all.

Both Doniphon and Stoddard have their eye on the lovely woman who also works in the restaurant. She is played by the terrific Vera Miles.The antagonist to our two heroes is the title character Liberty Valance. He is perfectly portrayed by Lee Marvin. Valance is obnoxious, foul-mouthed and very tough. Everyone, with the exception of Doniphon (Wayne), fears Liberty Valance. Valance singles out Stoddard (Stewart) for his abuse. Stoddard, being from the East, has no skill for dealing with such a person. He can neither fight nor shoot. He believes that laws and sheriffs will protect him from the wilder elements of the frontier. But the Wild, Wild West is not fully tamed. How can a city-slicker like Ransom Stoddard stand up to an outlaw like Liberty Valance? One story about this movie that I love. Both Stewart and Wayne were huge stars before this film was released. Who would get top-billing? Having your name appear first in the credits (top-billing) was a sign of status in Hollywood. Both actors agreed that Stewart would get top-billing in all the advertising. Things like the posters, lobby cards, etc. would all feature Jimmy Stewart above John Wayne. Wayne would get top-billing in the opening credits. This would create some balance between the two stars.

Callahan doesn't go by the book. In his view, his job is to get the bad guys and that's what he does - except that not going by the book lets the serial killer get away, because his constitutional rights were violated. That's really the underlying theme of the movie - how do you defend the rights of the innocent victims when you have to be so concerned about the rights of the accused. That's a concern that remains with us even today, so even though the movie is almost 40 years old, it still has a relevance to it; a message which will resonate with many people. The movie leads up to a pretty exciting ending with the school bus hijacking, and Callahan's last statement of contempt for the system in which he works.If I were to compare this to, say, Gran Torino (Eastwood's latest and perhaps last movie) I'd say that I preferred Gran Torino more because there seemed to be more sustained excitement in it, whereas Dirty Harry (because Callahan is an active cop) has a few more mundane scenes, since it has to portray the system in which Callahan works.

He plays Dave Garver, a radio disc jockey based in Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, the town where Eastwood himself lives. The title comes from the classic Erroll Garner ballad Misty; its significance in the film is that Garver has a fan who habitually phones into his radio show to request this record.Garver eventually meets this fan, a young woman named Evelyn Draper, and the two have a brief affair, but he breaks it off, fearing that she is becoming too demanding and possessive. He then rekindles his relationship with his former girlfriend Tobie (I thought that was a boy's name), but Evelyn is not a woman to take no for an answer and tries to win him back. When he rebuffs her, Evelyn's love turns to obsession and she begins stalking Garver, who quickly realises that she is mentally unbalanced and that both he and Tobie are in danger.There are some similarities between this film and Eastwood's previous one, The Beguiled, in which he also plays a character in danger from jealous or unbalanced female antagonists. The two films are, however, quite different in atmosphere. The Beguiled was a period piece set against the American Civil War and with a claustrophobic Southern Gothic feel to it. Play Misty for Me, by contrast, is very modern in style, set against the backdrop of some attractively photographed California coastal scenery around Carmel-by-the-Sea and neighbouring Monterey. (Some scenes, reflecting Eastwood's love of jazz, were shot at the Monterey Jazz Festival).One thing I did not care for was that extended soft-focus sequence in which Garver and Tobie wander along the shore, walk through the woods and finally make love, all to the strains of Roberta Flack's version of The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face; this seemed like something taken from a slightly soft porn remake of Love Story. Every cloud has a silver lining, though, and its exposure in this film propelled this beautiful song to number one, providing Flack with her first big hit.The plot of Play Misty for Me is similar to that of Fatal Attraction from 1987 and other more recent stalker films such as Swimfan, but in 1971 this was a more original concept than it would be today. One obvious difference between this film and Fatal Attraction is that Michael Douglas' character Dan Gallagher is married when he begins his fateful affair, and therefore cheating on his spouse, whereas Garver is single. (It is made quite clear that at the time of his affair with Evelyn he is not in a relationship with Tobie). Perhaps in conservative Reagan-era American the makers of Fatal Attraction felt that they should please the moral majority by including a Thou shalt not commit adultery message in their film.Of the two films, however, it is Fatal Attraction that I would prefer, despite its moralising. Indeed, it is perhaps its moral dimension which gives the later film greater depth. Play Misty for Me is a tense and at times exciting thriller, but it lacks this dimension. Garver is simply the innocent victim of a psychotic woman's malice, whereas Gallagher's moral lapse means that he has, to some extent, brought his troubles on himself. Although Jessica Walter here gives a fine performance as the demented Evelyn, the script does not give her as much complexity as Glenn Close's character Alex. Gallagher's philandering has caused emotional harm not only to his wife but also to Alex herself, and she therefore becomes, if not a sympathetic character, at least one who has been wronged and whose motives we can understand. (For similar reasons I preferred Martin Scorsese's remake of Cape Fear, in which the moral distinctions between Bowden and Cady are more blurred, to the J Lee Thompson original in which Bowden is a clean-cut hero and Cady a straightforward villain).The success of Fatal Attraction paved the way for many inferior imitations, of which Swimfan is a particularly egregious example, but some of the stalker movies of the nineties, such as Single White Femaleor The Hand that Rocks the Cradle, are very good ones and approach their subject with a surprising depth.

Many different aspects of this film struck a chord with me, as the protagonist Perham is extremely relatable. Broad humanism is a prominent theme in this film, reminiscent of Renoir in that each character has his or own motivation for their actions. Perhan doesn't set out to end up as a murderer, hustler, robber but is forced to do so because of specific circumstances. Whatever his situation may be, we as the audience are able to sympathize with him because we understand what he ultimately wants to achieve and what goals he has set forth. Many roadblocks impair his quest for love and family, but there is a sense of hope that is never lost no matter how downtrodden his current situation may be. I thoroughly enjoyed this film as it gave not only American viewers a different perspective but viewers worldwide an eye-opening window into the lives of Gypsies and that they are people to. They too have their own wants and desires and do what they must in order to achieve them. This film opened my eyes to a new culture and a new perspective of seeing the world. It did so in showing Perhan's connections with his loved ones and enemies, relationships that all humans encounter at some point in their lives. This film truly is a celebration of life, loss and the road to redemption as well as the steps that it takes to get there. It also leaves a bittersweet message at the end, of how our children are sculpted by their predecessors, and how we must try to be as decently human as possible in hope for a better world for generations to come. Another feature of this film that I truly enjoyed was the magical realism incorporated into many heavily important scenes. Without giving too much away, the wedding scene was dreamlike and euphoric, shot in a way that makes you question if and what is happening on screen. Another aspect that I would like to mention is the use of symbols in the film, for example the symbolic meaning that goes along with the color white, which has a connection to Perhan's deceased mother, as well as the turkey we come to love almost as much as Perhan does. I really enjoyed this film from its up and downs of happy times and bad. Although at times the use of magical realism makes it seem somewhat unrealistic, I believe that anyone who watches this film will be able to associate themselves or loved ones with a character in this film.

The removal from office may not, we suspect, have been totally unwarranted. His mentor\/sidekick is Parnie McCarthy (Arthur O'Connell), an unrepentant lush who was also eminent at the bar in his day, and serves warnings both implicit and explicit to Biegler about the path he is now travelling. The shot at redemption arrives in the form of the Manion case, a decorated war hero accused of murdering the man who raped his wife.Except redemption seems a peripheral concern in the moral quagmire that the Manions inhabit. Fred Manion, a testosterone-fuelled Ben Gazzara, has no regrets about emptying a chamber of bullets into his victim. Laura Manion bears the physical scars of her ordeal (that may or may not have been at the hands of the gunned-down bar owner), but behaviorally in no way appears the rape victim, drinking and dancing in juke joints with her incarcerated husband's colleagues, and flirting overtly with his lawyer. The husband's plea of temporary insanity is doubtful, but Lee Remick's performance suggests that one member of this couple at least is genuinely mentally unstable.Mrs. Manion is a flirt and man-eater, but also, possibly, a rape victim. Her husband is a wife-beater and brawler, but also, possibly, a man driven out of his wits. The murder victim may have been a rapist, but he had a child that he cared for, a former lover in Canada that he stood by, and was respected as an employer. And Biegler is charismatic and adroit in defending his client, but blithely unconcerned with getting at the 'truth.' He high-handedly refuses Parnie's suggestion that he coach his client in his insanity plea, but through Socratic contortions leads him there anyway.At the end, Parnie is on the wagon, the law practice is on the up again, and the client couple disappear, to no great show of concern from Biegler. The law seems to have been manipulated rather than served, and no greater cause has been advanced. Take away Duke Ellington's score, the screwball banter with the secretary, the naive incompetence of the prosecutor, and Parnie's hammy lush moments and you are left with a very dark shade of film noir.The film earns every second of its expansive 160-minute run-time, layering in the complexity. There are no red herrings, because there is no absolute truth to work in counterpoint. A rosary set is introduced at first to show sincerity, and then revealed to be possibly a tool of deception. The acting is superb, Stewart effortlessly charismatic up against Gazzara's jagged, flawed masculinity. Remick hold the attention more than most, either ditsy or deeply disturbed. Stewart perhaps employs a tad too much frivolity in his attempts to cope with her overt sexuality, but in the character of Mrs. Manion the film blazes a path that would eventually see Jodie Foster gain an Oscar for her portrayal of the morally questionable Sarah Tobias in The Accused almost thirty years later.The film's thematic concern is the essence of justice, and whether such high concepts are truly served by our degraded legal systems that claim to conjure up such notions. Arguments presented in black-and-white terms are represented as unrelentingly grey, and it is that achievement that makes this movie timeless.

The murder victim may have been a rapist, but he had a child that he cared for, a former lover in Canada that he stood by, and was respected as an employer. And Biegler is charismatic and adroit in defending his client, but blithely unconcerned with getting at the 'truth.' He high-handedly refuses Parnie's suggestion that he coach his client in his insanity plea, but through Socratic contortions leads him there anyway.At the end, Parnie is on the wagon, the law practice is on the up again, and the client couple disappear, to no great show of concern from Biegler. The law seems to have been manipulated rather than served, and no greater cause has been advanced. Take away Duke Ellington's score, the screwball banter with the secretary, the naive incompetence of the prosecutor, and Parnie's hammy lush moments and you are left with a very dark shade of film noir.The film earns every second of its expansive 160-minute run-time, layering in the complexity. There are no red herrings, because there is no absolute truth to work in counterpoint. A rosary set is introduced at first to show sincerity, and then revealed to be possibly a tool of deception. The acting is superb, Stewart effortlessly charismatic up against Gazzara's jagged, flawed masculinity. Remick hold the attention more than most, either ditsy or deeply disturbed. Stewart perhaps employs a tad too much frivolity in his attempts to cope with her overt sexuality, but in the character of Mrs. Manion the film blazes a path that would eventually see Jodie Foster gain an Oscar for her portrayal of the morally questionable Sarah Tobias in The Accused almost thirty years later.The film's thematic concern is the essence of justice, and whether such high concepts are truly served by our degraded legal systems that claim to conjure up such notions. Arguments presented in black-and-white terms are represented as unrelentingly grey, and it is that achievement that makes this movie timeless. ","genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery"}]
