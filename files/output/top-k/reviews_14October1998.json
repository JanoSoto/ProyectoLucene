It's true that the concept may seem  trite to those of us over 40 who have read and seen countless attempts at related material, but that should not spoil this film for those still fairly new to these concepts. If you recall how incredibly thought provoking and marvelous Heinlein's Stranger In A Strange Land was to you at age 18 you will get the point. Several years ago I picked up the book for a re-read and found it trite, unimaginative and sexist. Both responses were honest and real, but from different life\/time perspectives. The same could be true for this movie. Only to those of us jaded by the genre would this film seem silly and less than spectacular. I think the movie was beautiful. It is sappy, true, but sap is what keeps old and young trees alive. When our society becomes too sophisticated to enjoy a good old fashioned sappy love story it is evidence of a withering soul. Time to stop and smell the roses again.... Or in this case, get back to the art museum and spend some solitary hours moving inside the paintings again, like you did when you were younger and more amazed at the talents and visions of the world.

Alternating between lines of incredibly cheesy dialogue (Everything's personal if you're a person) and scenes of great visual imagination (in particular the chase sequence where the bad guy doesn't run but simply moves through a line of people), Fallen is a really good action movie gone slightly askew.The acting is proficient enough, although Gabriel Casseus turns in a somewhat bizarre performance as Denzil Washington's brother, Art. The main idea itself is used to good effect, particularly in the scenes where Washington attempts to confront Azazel in his various guises, with occasional tragic effect.Unfortunately, however, the scripting is, as mentioned, a little on the patchy side and the addition of an ill-judged voice-over by Washington does nothing for the pace of the film.  Add in Embeth Davidtz dry as dust, Name of the Rose-style witterings about the nature of the beast and Washington's thoughts on sin and redemption and you have a good action movie with a nice twist let down by its attempts to be more than that.
