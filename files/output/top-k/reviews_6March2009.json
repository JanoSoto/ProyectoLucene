One that I think is noteworthy is Pushover from 1954, but mostly because it featured the feature film debut of my favorite actress, Kim Novak, and featured Fred MacMurray as a villain, which I always felt he would be effective as. But while Pushover (1954) was interesting, Otto Preminger's Laura from 1944 is absorbing and powerful.The film's plot takes the typical crime-noir setting (a who-done-it scenario) and blends it with a good atmosphere of great characters and a shocking turning point of a middle. It's based on a bestseller by Vera Caspary, which was about a detective (Dana Andrews) investigating the murder of a woman (Gene Tierney) who before her death, had risen to fame in the city under her friend, a cynical newspaper columnist (Clifton Webb) and a charming playboy (Vincent Price). As he learns about the woman's past, the detective is slowly drawn into her memory and, just as Webb's character coldly notices, he's fallen in love with a corpse. The reason why Laura is more effective and powerful than most other who-done-its is because it embraces a psychological atmosphere with a well-written screenplay by Jay Dratler and taken care of under director Otto Preminger. The movie does not have very many characters. The credited cast stops after five names. But these five main characters are all that Preminger needs to create a dramatic, witty story that utilizes both style and substance to keep us interested unlike a lot of films today that seem to embrace only one or the other, mostly the former instead of the latter, which is far more important. The characters are well-played. Arguably the key performance is not by leading lady Gene Tierney or even by Dana Andrews, but by Clifton Webb, who when he made Laura, had stepped in front of a motion picture camera for the first time in fourteen years and garnered and Academy Award nomination soon afterward. Webb's character, who was clearly based off of critic Alexander Woollcott, is a human being of two sides. At times, he seems like a very gentle, relatable soul; a charming person whom you cannot find yourself disliking and then in some other scenes can be utterly cold and vicious such as in a scene where he warns off the Gene Tierney character in a flashback that he's engaged in something far more important than her career. When she asks what that is, Webb chillingly responds with My lunch. And it's at these moments that you might even find yourself suspecting Webb's character for being the murderer. And there's also Vincent Price, unusually cast as a weak individual, but perhaps also a wise casting choice because his tall stature and creepy mannerisms tend to associate him with our primary suspect. In regards to Dana Andrews, he was also a great casting choice. He had the physical appearance of a worn-down detective and matched the manners of the character just right. And of course, there is the gorgeous Gene Tierney in her most memorable performance, even though she is mostly shown through flashback, we come to understand her and maybe even fall in love with her as Andrews' character is, even though all we know about her is what Webb and Price have to relate.Laura is one of the more unique crime films in the history of cinema and undoubtedly Gene Tierney's most famous film and of course one of Otto Preminger's best works. It does have kind of a sudden way of ending, but it does play itself out very well, keeping us interested not only with the mystery, but the characters and their lives.

Kyle Reese( Michael Biehn), a young man who has grown up in the ruins and ashes of a destroyed world, is sent from the future to warn and protect her. Both The Terminator and Kyle have no intentions of failing their missions, but only one can succeed...James Cameron's Terminator is a complex blend of classic science fiction, high octane action, and immense terror, glazed with style and deep with story. There are so many little things that make this movie great. I love the irony of the opening scenes The Terminator, who has come to seek, to kill, and to destroy, does just this, all without alarming the local police. Kyle Reese, who has come to protect and serve, is soon being chased and hunted thy the police. Not long after, there is a scene where the ruthless Terminator steels a police car and adopts an officer's voice, essentially joining the police ranks, all to hunt down Kyle, who has become a wanted criminal. It's this helter skelter social commentary and pessimistic irony, that comprises the film's dark, gritty tone. It is interesting to note that this is a dark film, and the Terminator series has increasingly become more mainstream and child-friendly over the years, with a 'good guy' Terminator, child actors, and a possible pg-13 rating for the fourth film, Terminator Salvation. The first film however, remains a dark and gritty little thriller.The thing that makes The Terminator, The Terminator, is Schwarzenegger's performance as The Terminator. This is without a doubt the greatest performance I have ever seen from Schwarzenegger. Though some may mock and say  He's only playing a robot, and he's only doing a good job because playing a mechanical being requires no acting, Schwarzenegger does an incredible job that few top notch actors could pull off. In a word, The Terminator is scary, and most of what creates that sense of fear is Arnold's presence his hulking, looming body, his mechanical gestures, his soulless facial expressions, his cold, emotionless voice. The Terminator is ruthless, cold, impossible to reason with, heartless. He feels no pain nor pity. He is a man made force that dedicates all to the mission at hand. When watching the film, I was reminded of the character of Michale Myers in John Carpenter's slasher Halloween. Cold, ruthless, always in the shadows and ready to strike. Truly The Terminator is the Michale Myers of action films. And it is Arnold Schwarzenegger that makes us believe makes us believe that he's out there, and he will find you, because thats what he does. That's all he does.Opposing the one man(Err, machine?)army Terminator is a great cast of Jame's Cameron favorites. Michael Biehn does a knock out job as the scarred war-child from the future, I absolutely love his performance in this film. He has a sense of urgency and child like confusion emitting from him that fits not only his character and his development, but the story has a whole. When Kyle speaks, all listen. Linda Hamilton is a blast to watch as the sweet waitress who finds herself thrust into chaos and bloodshed. She's believable, what an I say? Also, for the screen time they receive, Paul Winfield and Lance Henriksen as Lieutenant Ed Traxler and Detective Hal Vukovich respectively, are a blast to watch. They have excellent chemistry and work off each other excellently.The effects are also quite good. Sure there are some cheesy lazer beams here and there, but overall the special effect where really good. The future war scenes\/flashbacks are nicely crafted and disturbingly juxtaposed into images from our own society. The Terminator effects are also very well done. There are just so many great scenes and so many great lines littered throughout this film. The scene in the Tech Noir club, the explosive police station scene, the scene with Linda and Kyle under the bridge. The Terminator has a very limited vocabulary, but he knows how to use it When he leans in to tell the police receptionist that I'll be back, you want to cheer. And the musical score by Brad Fiedel is just great.The ending scene is probably one of my favorite scenes in the film. It ties everything together and leads perfectly into what is yet to come.

But who will win and what will actually happen if either Jet Li dies, leading to possibilities such as implosions, explosions and ultimate destruction of the multiverse.Directed by James Wong (who, alongside producer Glen Morgan, comes from a fine background that includes The X-Files, Millennium and the Final Destination movies) with a great mix of humour and style, this movie rattles along from one action set-piece to another.

As I got more into anime and Tim Burton, I always held a love of this movie. I have recently rediscovered the movie and now see it in a different light. It is Disney's strongest, most stirring tale; one that tells of prejudice and acceptance. It touches on many sensitive aspects, very rare in Disney films, such as the Christian religion, damnation and bigotry, as well keeping the trademark Disney themes of overcoming great adversaries and believing in oneself. The story came from that of Victor Hugo's 19th Century novel, which, oddly enough, was a cry to preserve the sanctity of the holy building in which it took place. Anyway, it is an adaption that tells the story of Quasimodo (Tom Hulce), who desires to be a part of society, but his master, Frollo (Tony Jay, in his most riveting performance) keeps him confined out of fear and scorn for the poor beast. But, when he is crowned King in the annual Festival of Fools, he captures the heart of outspoken and beautiful Esmeralda (Demi Moore), whom he helps escape Frollo's wrath.The movie has many big names, as well as some lesser known, who deliver a wonderful performance. Tony Jay*, known for his deep, compelling voice in video games and cartoons, probably delivered his finest performance in this film, that of a tortured and corrupted religious figure. Paul Kandel delivered the performance of the versatile Clopin, the narrator of the story, if you will. The three gargoyles, one of which is voiced by Jason Alexander, gives the movie a touch of loyal Disney sidekicks. However, this movie received a G-rating. I feel, due to it's dark undertones, that it should have been given a PG. Many of the themes will go over the heads of kids under 7, and it may seem frightening at times, as well as the VERY thinly veiled element of lust, so parents, be warned.

It's easy to see how much love the director had for the James Joyce novel as every scene in the film just has a certain atmosphere that can only be passion. The film centers on a family gathered for a Christmas dinner in 1907 Ireland and the impact that death, love and not loving will have on the select group including Greta (Anjelica Huston). I must admit that I admired this movie a lot more than I actually enjoyed it and I'm only saying this because it took me quite a while to warm up to the characters. As strange as it might sound, I had no problem getting caught up in their stories and the scenery they were making but for some reason the real heart and soul of the actual characters never really hit me until the end of the film. Perhaps this is due to the brilliant visual style, which really is a character all of its own. The way Huston filmed the scenes and the amount of atmosphere and at times dread he put into all of them makes this one of his most impressive jobs as a director. There were countless scenes where Huston just let the camera float around picking up different bits of dialogue and I couldn't help but get swept away into everything that was going on. The dim lights, wonderful camera pans and the masterful performances all make this film stick out as something special. The entire cast does a remarkable job but to me it's Huston that really sticks out with her excellent performance, which was just two years removed from her Oscar winning role in her father's Prizzi's Honor. The intensity she brings to the film's final twenty-minutes are something to really belong and her work with Donal McCann, who plays her husband, is chilling. Sean McClory, Frank Patterson and Dan O'Herlihy all add terrific supporting performances. The film runs a rather short 82-minutes but there's so much to think about here that you really forget how short it is. Seeing as how this was Huston's final film you really can't help but think what was going through his ill body while filming this.

What the heck? Only people as sick as Alex DeLarge can like and be hungry for more of this after watching him for two hours. Only sociopaths. Alex DeLarge is a sick, sick character. I felt repulsed, angry, sick and hateful watching him and his doings. It felt good to see him get arrested and tortured by his treatment. But it hit me that when he got his treatment, the doctors and the politicians responsible was doing virtually the same things to him. They took away Alex's free will by torturing him, threw him out on the street unable to defend himself and when he got beaten up and tortured by the people he had offended earlier in the movie it was really the governments fault. They almost killed him and was applauded for it, even though they were just as evil as him, cause they knew they didn't make him a better man, they were fully aware that they were just restricting him violently to make him a better man TO SOCIETY. And I felt sick. Just like Alex I felt really nauseous. It all felt so meaningless. Everyone and everything was sick, everyone was violated, everyone got hurt, everyone just thought of themselves and not of others. It made me wanna throw up! The government just wanted to use Alex, first to front their new program, then to ensure that he didn't give them bad publicity after their treatment almost killed him. Yes, he is a sick sociopath, but so is the government people. They say that Kubricks intention with Clockwork was to attack the treatment. And its probably true, but for me this is just as much a study of all that is bad in mankind, and it really made me feel how bad we humans can be! In the end, Alex turns out just as bad as he started, maybe even worse, because of the violent treatment. And he's glad for it. He's back on the track of violence and raping and he is LOVING it. In Alex' own words I was cured all right. The violence made him worse. The bastards made the bastard worse.Many movies glorifies violence. But never before has a movie made me feel THIS repulsed by it. Now, an hour after seeing the movie, I still feel like crap. Violence makes nothing but more violence, and no one can be cured from anything by violent means. This movie showed me, made me FEEL that one thing clearer than anything has ever done before Nothing good comes out of violence! Absolutely NOTHING! It just strengthens, expands and makes evil. I had never thought that I would love to be repulsed by a movie.We should think about that after watching violent action movies. Why do we enjoy violence so much? And I'm the first to say that I do so myself! I find movies like Die Hard very entertaining. But why? After all it is horrible, and that is what makes A Clockwork Orange a masterpiece, what makes it unique; it makes us feel the horror of violence and evil. No other movies that I can think of does that, at least not in such a degree that I have felt literally near vomiting. And that effect is outstanding, cause that's how we ought to feel. In a way, Die Hard is a much more dangerous movie to see for children than this, cause it portrays violence as cool and entertaining. And THAT is scary!So I ask myself Can you really like and be fascinated by a movie this repulsive? Yes, when it is horrible for a purpose! And the purpose is strong messages against violence and perhaps even more important against the justified violence, that the society does for the common good.

As the crew, and their hot headed Navy Seal passengers, get down deeper, it would seem they are not alone down there.The Abyss is a flawed movie when put under the microscope, even allowing for the reinserted (and much better) ending that James Cameron was forced to cut by idiot studio executives. Most glaringly obvious as a fault is that The Abyss, after holding us for 2 hours of engrossing cinema, can't quite seal the deal as a deep (hrr hrr hrr) message movie for the modern era. What isn't in doubt upon revisits to the piece is that it's at times spectacular, at others it's joyously ambitious, both things coming together in one big loud boom of being a blockbuster with brains. James Cameron can never be accused of not trying to entertain the masses, and here, with a bit more thought on a humanist level, then we would have been talking in the realms of masterpiece.The making of the film is itself worthy of a movie, a fraught and angry shoot with many problems, of which I wont bore you with as they can be found at the click of a mouse.

Unfortunately, they are so uniformly bad that it has taken me now over a year to get through the three of them. I finished watching part III today and, like the two films before it, it was a notably underwhelming cinematic experience.By this point in the series, the Rambo formula is worked out in every detail. Rambo just wants to be left alone but then gets sucked into some brutally violent situation which, again, he has to take care of all on his own. He doesn't really play well with others, you see.Just as we found him languishing in a prison labor camp at the beginning of the second movie, Rambo is now living the dubious life of a monk in Thailand who takes breaks from the monastery to head into Bangkok and make some extra money in the stick-fighting competitions, which he promptly turns over to the monks to help build the monastery. He likes the feeling of belonging that he gets from living among the monks and doesn't want to be a soldier anymore. Needless to say, when the guys with the stripes on their shoulders approach and ask for his help, he's uninterested until a mission goes forward in Afghanistan and results in the good guy from the second movie getting taken prisoner, the first American ever taken prisoner in Afghanistan.And here, just like the last movie, is where everything starts to fall apart. The first American ever captured in Afghanistan is not an enviable position, to be sure, so it's easy to understand why Rambo would make such a sudden change of heart. What is unfortunately missing is the entire rest of the American military. I'm curious about how the real members of the United States military responded to the movie, which portrays them as either helpless or completely absent.It may be, perhaps, that the mission is thought to be a lost cause or not worth the risk, so sending Rambo in must, of course, be done unofficially. If Rambo is caught, he is told prior to embarking on the mission, the military will deny all knowledge of his existence, which prompts Rambo to sneer and say he's used to such treatment, and then do that thing where he ties his headband on all dramatically.At any rate, it's no surprise when Rambo insists that he has to do everything on his own. If you saw the level of sheer camp that the second movie reached then you know something of what to expect here, although it should be said that Rambo III is certainly better than First Blood Part II, which is undeniably the worst film of the already unimpressive series.It is definitely interesting, however, to watch the way the Afghani people are portrayed in the movie.Rambo enters Afghanistan alone and has to make his way to where the prisoner is being kept with only a single in-country contact, who tells him all about the cultural realities on the ground for the Afghani people. Alexander the Great tried and failed to conquer the Afghans, then the British, then the Americans, and they all failed. He explains to Rambo and ancient battle prayer written by a long-since defeated enemy - May God deliver us from the venom of the cobra, the teeth of the tiger, and the vengeance of the Afghan.The relationship between America and Afghanistan has changed drastically over the years, and not in a good way. In fact, given that we're at war in Afghanistan right now, this movie appears strangely prophetic. If George W. Bush had re-watched Rambo III somewhere around early 2003, it would not be a stretch to think that the situation in the middle east might be drastically different right now.Every day your war machines lose ground to a bunch of poorly armed, poorly equipped freedom fighters. The fact is you underestimated your competition. If you'd studied your history you would know that these people have never given up to anyone. They'd rather die than be slaves to an invading army. You can't defeat a people like that!Believe it or not, this is not a scathing criticism of America's current war in Afghanistan, it's a scathing criticism by the American prisoner of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in the movie. It is one of the movie's strangest qualities that it pitts the Americans and the Afghans as allies against the cartoonishly villainous Soviets, who come in the form of wild-eyed lunatics at the controls of attack helicopters that buzz small villages laying waste unprovoked to whole populations of peaceful civilians. They are not just an invading force, they are airborne murderers that bombs women and children and disguise bombs as toys to trick unsuspecting children.With such enemies, it is understandable when one character ominously says, God would have mercy, Rambo won't... as Rambo sets off on his preposterous one-man mission of vengeance against the invading Soviets. It's interesting that the movie makes so much of how the Afghans have never given in to any invading force in their long history, and yet now they need Rambo to come in and save them from the Russians, but no matter. The movie was made to give the world another dose of outlandish Rambo-style retribution directed at the evil forces that be, and that's what it delivers. It's just too bad that Rambo-style retribution is generally so head-smackingly dumb.

After watching the film a couple of times I am far less fascinated by Kim Basinger than by Rourke's character Jon. Sure Jon was very aggressive sexually with Elizabeth, and many seem to understand this as being crude or offensive. Instead Jon strikes me as being more honest than slimy. While other men in Jon's position, a wealthy commodities broker, would try to use his position to win over Elizabeth, Jon just straight-forward lets her know that he wants her. I also don't think Jon merely wants Elizabeth for sex. Clearly he enjoys her company for more than just that, in fact he shares a great deal of his world with her. I think what is offensive about Rourke's character is that Jon is so unapologetically male. First, Jon has a high-powered job which at the time was extremely risky and lucrative. Yeah, while Jon lives in a fancy apartment and buys Elizabeth nice things, it is clear that he is not a trust-fund baby but a guy who worked his way to the top with determination and balls.That helps explain the most difficult scene in the movie. Elizabeth has been snooping through his stuff and Jon returns enraged and semi-rapes Elizabeth. Earlier that evening Jon had promised to take care of Elizabeth and provide for her every need, which is quite a commitment, and he leaves her alone for a short time but finds that he already cannot really trust her. His response to her actions is bizarre, first he wants to spank her then he forcefully makes love to her. Is it abusive? Yes probably. What the hell does it mean? Well, here you have a guy who is in an extremely competitive position where he has scrapped his way to the top. In his position weakness and vulnerability get you decimated in your job, and most women you meet probably only want you for your money. Jon takes a chance with a girl he meets randomly who he seems to have a real connection with, and almost from the get-go she compromises his trust. He forces himself on her because he is desperate to have connection with somebody who will be a refuge for him, yet from his perspective he already cannot trust her. The rest of the movie, all of the sexual escapades, including the sex scene at the end with the prostitute is Jon trying to determine how much he should really give himself to Elizabeth. The scene where Elizabeth shows up at his work is indicative of this. Clearly he is not happy at first that she showed up there. Judging from the size of his office this guy is at the pinnacle of success, and letting somebody he isn't sure he can trust into that world is very risky for him. Not only does it reveal himself to her, but it reveals to the other people around him that he is vulnerable. For men of power in that kind of position, vulnerability can destroy their careers.The prostitute scene at the end wasn't just some other kinky escapade. I think it was a final test for Jon so that he would know whether Elizabeth was really committed to him or not, or if she was only viewing their relationship as a sexual game. To him it was the only way to know how exclusively she cared about him. When she reacted by making out with the random guy in the porn theater, Jon finally understood that she really did care about him. By that point, however he had destroyed any trust she had in him.Basinger's character, Elizabeth in contrast, was far less complicated. She enjoys her friends, has a good relationship with her parents, and even has a decent relationship with her ex-husband. If you contrast the type of jobs the two have in the movie, it is easy to see the dramatic differences in their lives. Elizabeth casually jokes with her boss and co-workers, and the biggest pressure in her life is whether an artist will show up at a show. This movie was about all of the things that sex communicates, and ultimately Rourke brilliantly pulls off a complicated character who is unabashedly male and dying to be vulnerable at the same time.

The simple reason for that is the writing is so spot-on and the direction flawless it becomes more than a movie in the traditional sense but more of a inner look into the intertwining of a relationship on the ends of its life. This can only be accomplished with two wonderful actors capable of carrying the material farther than it could be on paper alone. Natalie Wood was one of the finest young actresses of her generation and this showcases her talent better than perhaps any other film she did. She conveys such incredibly strong feelings of remorse, desperation and sadness as the fragile Deanie, it takes the audience into the world of this character and we can feel nothing but sympathy for her. The same is true with Bud, played here by a very young Warren Beatty.Perhaps the one true problem I saw with this film is that the story doesn't go far enough. I understand they were already under fire from the censors for their portrayal of young people trying to repress sexual urges, but I'm sure Kazan could have come up with a way to show not just how Bud and Deanie felt about each other but to better examine the relationship with their respective parents. There are several scenes I thought and hoped would go even further in-depth to the problems being faced here, but instead it pulls back and we are left to wonder. If there is one thing that saves the movie it is the final sequence, showing what happens to the two lovers and what this means for them now. This is absolutely touching and beautiful and a great ending to an other wise uncomfortable story.Still, to think of the film in retrospect is to take it seriously and understand that this is not just a story about two people in love at a time when everybody was telling them to not be. It is in fact, a symbol of the restraints that pull on any of us that have ever been involved seriously with somebody. It speaks to us not just as lovers but also as human beings desiring companionship and the great pains we will go through to make that happen.

The simple reason for that is the writing is so spot-on and the direction flawless it becomes more than a movie in the traditional sense but more of a inner look into the intertwining of a relationship on the ends of its life. This can only be accomplished with two wonderful actors capable of carrying the material farther than it could be on paper alone. Natalie Wood was one of the finest young actresses of her generation and this showcases her talent better than perhaps any other film she did. She conveys such incredibly strong feelings of remorse, desperation and sadness as the fragile Deanie, it takes the audience into the world of this character and we can feel nothing but sympathy for her. The same is true with Bud, played here by a very young Warren Beatty.Perhaps the one true problem I saw with this film is that the story doesn't go far enough. I understand they were already under fire from the censors for their portrayal of young people trying to repress sexual urges, but I'm sure Kazan could have come up with a way to show not just how Bud and Deanie felt about each other but to better examine the relationship with their respective parents. There are several scenes I thought and hoped would go even further in-depth to the problems being faced here, but instead it pulls back and we are left to wonder. If there is one thing that saves the movie it is the final sequence, showing what happens to the two lovers and what this means for them now. This is absolutely touching and beautiful and a great ending to an other wise uncomfortable story.Still, to think of the film in retrospect is to take it seriously and understand that this is not just a story about two people in love at a time when everybody was telling them to not be. It is in fact, a symbol of the restraints that pull on any of us that have ever been involved seriously with somebody. It speaks to us not just as lovers but also as human beings desiring companionship and the great pains we will go through to make that happen.

The plot of the film is straightforward. Fueled by greed, a wife decides to take out an insurance policy on her unsuspecting husband, with plans of murdering him for the proceeds. The policy contains a double indemnity clause, which will pay twice the policy amount in the event of death by accident. To make her plan succeed, she enlists the help of an accomplice to help murder her spouse and make it seem accidental.Adapted from a novel by James M. Cain, Double Indemnity is loosely based on the real-life Snyder-Gray murder case of 1927, in which a New York housewife persuaded her young lover to commit murder. The woman had taken out a double indemnity life insurance policy on her husband without his knowledge. The murder succeeded but the killers were caught and executed the following year. Just as actual events influenced the making of this film, Double Indemnity has influenced numerous movies based on the same premise, the most notable of which are 1946's The Postman Always Rings Twice and 1981's Body Heat.The film stars Fred MacMurray as Walter Neff, a fast-talking insurance salesman, attempting to pull the perfect fraud job. It is Fred MacMurray who is narratting the film. Of course he didn't start out with that idea - it all stated when he met, and immediately fell for, Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck). From there the tale she spins of her unhappy marriage, complicated by a tempestuous relationship with stepdaughter Lola, takes him on the slippery slope to crime. With his extensive knowledge of the insurance business, nothing can stop Walter from covering his tracks ingeniously&#133; except the analytical skills of his friend, the fraud investigator Barton Keyes.Frequently told in flashbacks, this movie is utterly compelling from the word go. It's interesting to ponder whether this film could have had the same impact if it had been shot in colour - but I don't think so. The filming is spot on, the camera angles, use of shadow and perspectives on the actors all add to the tension of the film. The screen does sometimes get so dark as to be impossible to tell what's going on in a couple of scenes, but this is done deliberately so as to add to the suspense.The film is very wordy, as so many films of the era were and the dialogue is often brilliant. Billy Wilder's direction is another part of the key to this film's being in the IMDb Top 250 Movies of All Time list and also features in the Top 50 among the IMDb Film Noir list in fact at # 3 when I last saw it. There are moments of humour to lighten the mood and scenes of compelling drama \/ intrigue \/ emotion. With the excellent acting, awesome script and breathtaking art direction \/ cinematography it makes one of the best films of all time in a lot of peoples' list - including mine.In case you didn't know (I didn't), the term Double Indemnity refers to an insurance clause where a double payment is handed out if someone whose life is insured dies in an unusual manner. Theoretically of course the chances of this happening are remote, meaning little danger of them ever having to pay it out&#133; and cases when someone has died in this manner shortly after taking out a life insurance policy would automatically be viewed as suspicious. The way Walter covers his tracks, and the way Barton uncovers them, are quite brilliant and show (to a layman at least) a deep knowledge of the insurance business.Double Indemnity was nominated for no less that seven Oscars; sadly it didn't win a single one.

Maximus plans to retire to his olive gardens with wife and son, but the sickly Emperor has other ideas, bequeathing Maximus the stewardship of Rome over that of his natural-born son and rightful heir, the fey Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). When Commodus discovers this slight, he cries a little, promptly kills his father, arrests Maximus, and gets progressively feyer.Commodus then invents the James-Bond-Batman-Death, that is, don't kill your nemesis quickly and efficiently in full view, order your incompetent men to take him somewhere and probably kill him if he doesn't use his dangerous ingenuity and superior combat skills to escape. This also guarantees you are completely in the dark as to whether your enemy is dead, until he appears unexpectedly somewhere and vexes you.This Maximus does, defying Commodus and leaving him terribly vexed.Thereby arriving at Part Three of the slogan. In the interim, Maximus discovered his family was crucified by Commodus, which caused Maximus untold Academy Award-Winning Acting, subsequently collapsing in the desert and taken into slavery. The Gladiator merchant, Proximo (Oliver Reed, gravel-throated, rheumy-eyed - his last performance before going to that great arena in the sky) handpicks the indifferent yet lethal Maximus to join his stable of gladiators (which includes neighborly Numidian, Djimon Hounsou and man-mountain Ralf Moeller). Proximo scores a gig at The Coliseum, for the pleasure of now-Emperor Commodus.As Darth Vader thoomed, The circle is now complete. There were arena skirmishes before this one, but the Coliseum Carthage reenactment is the grandest rock star battle for Proximo's now-renowned gladiator troop, inspired and led by Maximus, as stirring and blood-pounding as BEN-HUR's chariot race. GLADIATOR's raucous, blood-glutted battle scenes are fitting successors to the realistic warfare of BRAVEHEART and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.Are you not entertained? His helmet disguising his identity, Maximus rallies his gladiators to defeat the lethal Imperial chariot-riders in the arena, to the surprise of Commodus, who wishes to meet the upstart who would not even salute the throne, let alone die conveniently for the public's pleasure. Maximus reveals himself to Commodus, who is driven to remarkable heights of feyness.Discovering Maximus is alive makes not only Commodus weak in the knees - so too his sister, Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), who pined for him back when her father the Emperor owned Maximus's taut butt. Her betrayal of Commodus sets in motion the third act, steeped in politics of reclaiming Rome as a republic, and therefore losing some of its verve.Beautifully filmed, in ocher tones and burnt umber (by director Ridley Scott and cinematographer John Mathieson), GLADIATOR nabbed Russell Crowe a Best Actor Oscar - even though Joaquin Phoenix did all the actual acting! Crowe pulls the Bruce Willis for most of the film, while Phoenix's sway-tilt emotions are a disturbing rainbow of subtlety.Phoenix's performance is absolutely stunning - that of a weak man, filled with disillusionment, contempt, envy, indecision; conflicting emotions constantly dancing across his face, flickers of smiles when we know he wants to cry humiliation, edging tears when we know he would rather lash out like the simple animal he is. It is Acting of a caliber few writers or directors could even describe, let alone trust an actor to convey.What we do in life echoes in eternity. Well. maybe, depending on what eternity you're talking about. For all its awe-inspiring action and chest-beating man-sweatiness, GLADIATOR has its faults writers David Franzoni, John Logan and William Nicholson can't figure what ancient civilization they're writing for. These are ROMANS, boys. So when Maximus pep talks his men at the very first battle ...if you find yourself alone, riding in green fields with the sun on your face, do not be troubled, for you are in Elysium - and you are already dead!, his troops should have replied, Excuse sir, but isn't that where GREEKS go? In his prayers, Maximus appeals to a Blessed Father - Jupiter? Janus? GLADIATOR pulls no punches when depicting the slaughter of countless of god's creations, yet is too gutless to depict polytheism. Especially in the Lead Actor with the Oscar push.When Maximus prays to the effigies of his wife and son and the Numidian asks, What do you say to them? he answers, To my son - I tell him I will see him again soon. To keep his heels down while riding his horse. To my wife... that is not your business. Big bonding laugh. Let me get this straight he's joking about sticking it to his raped and crucified wife in the afterlife? Is that not inappropriate? Are you not entertained? It vexes me. I'm terribly vexed. Phoenix all in white, Gladiator stumbling from a stab wound and seeing his predestination Christian homecoming, Jumilla giving a eulogy that makes our flesh crawl, the Numidian (who had his own religious beliefs) succumbing to the Christian myths (after all, they are the right ones, of course! Not like those other stupid religions, which Christians are still trying to wipe off the face of the Earth) and sotto voce, We will see each other again - but not yet!...Apparently, Gladiator is going home.

His helmet disguising his identity, Maximus rallies his gladiators to defeat the lethal Imperial chariot-riders in the arena, to the surprise of Commodus, who wishes to meet the upstart who would not even salute the throne, let alone die conveniently for the public's pleasure. Maximus reveals himself to Commodus, who is driven to remarkable heights of feyness.Discovering Maximus is alive makes not only Commodus weak in the knees - so too his sister, Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), who pined for him back when her father the Emperor owned Maximus's taut butt. Her betrayal of Commodus sets in motion the third act, steeped in politics of reclaiming Rome as a republic, and therefore losing some of its verve.Beautifully filmed, in ocher tones and burnt umber (by director Ridley Scott and cinematographer John Mathieson), GLADIATOR nabbed Russell Crowe a Best Actor Oscar - even though Joaquin Phoenix did all the actual acting! Crowe pulls the Bruce Willis for most of the film, while Phoenix's sway-tilt emotions are a disturbing rainbow of subtlety.Phoenix's performance is absolutely stunning - that of a weak man, filled with disillusionment, contempt, envy, indecision; conflicting emotions constantly dancing across his face, flickers of smiles when we know he wants to cry humiliation, edging tears when we know he would rather lash out like the simple animal he is. It is Acting of a caliber few writers or directors could even describe, let alone trust an actor to convey.What we do in life echoes in eternity. Well. maybe, depending on what eternity you're talking about. For all its awe-inspiring action and chest-beating man-sweatiness, GLADIATOR has its faults writers David Franzoni, John Logan and William Nicholson can't figure what ancient civilization they're writing for. These are ROMANS, boys. So when Maximus pep talks his men at the very first battle ...if you find yourself alone, riding in green fields with the sun on your face, do not be troubled, for you are in Elysium - and you are already dead!, his troops should have replied, Excuse sir, but isn't that where GREEKS go? In his prayers, Maximus appeals to a Blessed Father - Jupiter? Janus? GLADIATOR pulls no punches when depicting the slaughter of countless of god's creations, yet is too gutless to depict polytheism. Especially in the Lead Actor with the Oscar push.When Maximus prays to the effigies of his wife and son and the Numidian asks, What do you say to them? he answers, To my son - I tell him I will see him again soon. To keep his heels down while riding his horse. To my wife... that is not your business. Big bonding laugh. Let me get this straight he's joking about sticking it to his raped and crucified wife in the afterlife? Is that not inappropriate? Are you not entertained? It vexes me. I'm terribly vexed. Phoenix all in white, Gladiator stumbling from a stab wound and seeing his predestination Christian homecoming, Jumilla giving a eulogy that makes our flesh crawl, the Numidian (who had his own religious beliefs) succumbing to the Christian myths (after all, they are the right ones, of course! Not like those other stupid religions, which Christians are still trying to wipe off the face of the Earth) and sotto voce, We will see each other again - but not yet!...Apparently, Gladiator is going home.

Maximus plans to retire to his olive gardens with wife and son, but the sickly Emperor has other ideas, bequeathing Maximus the stewardship of Rome over that of his natural-born son and rightful heir, the fey Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). When Commodus discovers this slight, he cries a little, promptly kills his father, arrests Maximus, and gets progressively feyer.Commodus then invents the James-Bond-Batman-Death, that is, don't kill your nemesis quickly and efficiently in full view, order your incompetent men to take him somewhere and probably kill him if he doesn't use his dangerous ingenuity and superior combat skills to escape. This also guarantees you are completely in the dark as to whether your enemy is dead, until he appears unexpectedly somewhere and vexes you.This Maximus does, defying Commodus and leaving him terribly vexed.Thereby arriving at Part Three of the slogan. In the interim, Maximus discovered his family was crucified by Commodus, which caused Maximus untold Academy Award-Winning Acting, subsequently collapsing in the desert and taken into slavery. The Gladiator merchant, Proximo (Oliver Reed, gravel-throated, rheumy-eyed - his last performance before going to that great arena in the sky) handpicks the indifferent yet lethal Maximus to join his stable of gladiators (which includes neighborly Numidian, Djimon Hounsou and man-mountain Ralf Moeller). Proximo scores a gig at The Coliseum, for the pleasure of now-Emperor Commodus.As Darth Vader thoomed, The circle is now complete.

There have been countless road\/buddy movies since the dawn of cinema and it seems like the 80's gave us all sorts of these and this one here is certainly among the best as it delivers a great number of laughs as well as some great action. The screenplay offers up a lot of wonderful dialogue and situations even though the film does go on a tad bit too long.

DeNiro gives one of the best performances of his career and it remains proof that he could deliver plenty of laughs. His stern, smartass character is one he perfectly nails and there's never a false moment to anything he does. DeNiro is wonderfully plays the laughs at the right note and really knows how to mix his style with that of Grodin's. Speaking of Grodin, to me this is the best thing he's ever done in his career and it's that laid back nature of his that really sells his relationship with DeNiro. Taphet Kotto is marvelous as the FBI agent as is John Ashton as DeNiro's rival bounty hunter. Kotto, Ashton, Farina and Joe Pantoliano really mix it up well with DeNiro and this here leads to countless laughs. I think a lot of credit needs to go to the screenplay for allowing us to get to know the characters. A lot of these buddy movies just featured single note characters but that's certainly not the case here because by the end of the film you seem to really know and understand DeNiro and Grodin's characters. The movie even has some nice tension at the end when the bounty hunter and the mob are meeting up to exchange things in a Las Vegas airport. This here is certainly a busy genre but they don't get much better than this. With the caliber of acting and the tight direction this is certainly a highly recommended film.

The rationale is often that those versions are more faithful to the book. But I disagree, and if you care to read, I'll explain why.I will admit, firsthand, that Branagh's film follows the PLOT of the novel with minimal changes, however I feel that the changes, despite their minimal size, are detrimental to the novel's SPIRIT. And although I will proudly praise Fisher's version, He seems to be less concerned with focusing on the novel's themes than he is with his F--- the rich subplot he includes in all his movies. Whale's version discards the plot, but creates an excellent abstract adaption that drives home the novel's themes better than anyone else has, with the exception of Frankenstein The True Story and Fisher's Frankenstein must be Destroyed. One big complaint, is how Karloff's Monster isn't as sympathetic as the novel's Monster; pure tripe in my opinion.If anything; Karloff's portrayal is MORE sympathetic than the book's Creature. Critics say that's impossible because the Creature is given a criminal brain by Fritz, but that would only be a valid argument if he was shown to be violent solely for that reason, and he isn't. First, abnormal brain of the typical criminal could mean anything given the period's beliefs, perhaps the man in question was mentally ill, or had killed in self-defense, or was a minority of some sort. But Karloff's Monster does not turn violent for no reason, he does for flimsy reasons, but reason's nonetheless excusable because he's so stupid he walks backward and doesn't know people can drown. The creature is provoked by the sadistic Fritz, reacts angrily, is taunted, then attacks. Frankenstein, unwilling to take responsibility, has the creature locked away to be disciplined by Fritz. The creature kill's Fritz and breaks loose. And even then, his murders are in self-defense or accidents. The book's Creature goes through similar persecution(likely, but left ambiguous because it's told in flashback), but commits murder out of jealousy and to prove points, to COMPLETE innocents. Add the fact that the creature in the book understands the consequences, and feels no remorse until later, it becomes clear that, monster or not, he's a control-freak sociopath like Ted Bundy. The creature of the film is more like a retarded child who lashes out at bullies. The novel's creature kidnaps a child to make him my companion(plenty of child-abductors who are not pedophiles do the same thing in real life), then gleefully kills him when he learns he is Frankenstein's brother and frames a servant girl for the murder. In contrast, the film's Creature gently plays with a little girl, but accidentally drowns her, and dies at the hands of a mob who really DON'T have any proof he's guilty, in a scene reminiscent of both a Klan lynching and Christ's crucifixion. Yeah, what an 'unsympathetic' character in comparison to the book(Rolls eyes).Both characters are unpredictable and dangerous, but does Karloff's Creature really come off as unsympathetic just because he doesn't talk endlessly like the novel's monster? Would you rather pity the equivalent of Ted Bundy because he can talk rather than the equivalent of Lenny from Of Mice & Men because he cannot? I also want to point out how, name change and assistant aside, Colin Clive's portrayal of Frankenstein comes closer, personality wise, than any others. Clive is criticized for his hammy It's Alive! line, but in the novel, Frankenstein raves like that for SEVERAL CHAPTERS. This film doesn't take the easy way out by making Frankenstein into a monster-hunting hero(Branagh) or into a 19th century Lex Luthor(Fisher); he's like Shelley's portrayal; basically well-meaning and fully blessed with all any man could want, but secretive, callous, neglectful, and unwilling to see consequences until it's either too late or too early. I think Clive's otherwise restrained portrayal fares better than Branagh's, who overacts It's Alive style in EVERY scene. The fact that Karloff inspires more fear and more pity with a few grunts than De Niro does in Branagh's whole movie is also telling.So what exactly is the problem with Whale's film? It features the most spiritually accurate Dr. Frankenstein ever, drives home the themes of the plot better than any other version, the accusation that the monster is unsympathetic is horse ca ca since he's more sympathetic than he is in the actual novel, so what's to hate? The best answer is to visit the comments section for this movie under hated and the comment's under loved for Branaghs. 99.9% of the complaints are by children who hate it because it's an old movie in black & white, or who make homophobic comment's about James Whale(who was gay). The people who like the Branagh movie mostly just love it because it's in color, or because they are teenage English lit fan girls who think Branagh is hot, and any movie with attractive leads HAS to be better right? If they say they like it because it's more faithful they are lying because they never read it, or did read it but didn't like it, and therefore have no right to demand fidelity to source material they didn't like themselves.This movie isn't perfect, but of the 3 films I've cited as being the best spiritual adaptations, it's the best.

But I disagree, and if you care to read, I'll explain why.I will admit, firsthand, that Branagh's film follows the PLOT of the novel with minimal changes, however I feel that the changes, despite their minimal size, are detrimental to the novel's SPIRIT. And although I will proudly praise Fisher's version, He seems to be less concerned with focusing on the novel's themes than he is with his F--- the rich subplot he includes in all his movies. Whale's version discards the plot, but creates an excellent abstract adaption that drives home the novel's themes better than anyone else has, with the exception of Frankenstein The True Story and Fisher's Frankenstein must be Destroyed. One big complaint, is how Karloff's Monster isn't as sympathetic as the novel's Monster; pure tripe in my opinion.If anything; Karloff's portrayal is MORE sympathetic than the book's Creature. Critics say that's impossible because the Creature is given a criminal brain by Fritz, but that would only be a valid argument if he was shown to be violent solely for that reason, and he isn't. First, abnormal brain of the typical criminal could mean anything given the period's beliefs, perhaps the man in question was mentally ill, or had killed in self-defense, or was a minority of some sort. But Karloff's Monster does not turn violent for no reason, he does for flimsy reasons, but reason's nonetheless excusable because he's so stupid he walks backward and doesn't know people can drown. The creature is provoked by the sadistic Fritz, reacts angrily, is taunted, then attacks. Frankenstein, unwilling to take responsibility, has the creature locked away to be disciplined by Fritz. The creature kill's Fritz and breaks loose. And even then, his murders are in self-defense or accidents. The book's Creature goes through similar persecution(likely, but left ambiguous because it's told in flashback), but commits murder out of jealousy and to prove points, to COMPLETE innocents. Add the fact that the creature in the book understands the consequences, and feels no remorse until later, it becomes clear that, monster or not, he's a control-freak sociopath like Ted Bundy. The creature of the film is more like a retarded child who lashes out at bullies. The novel's creature kidnaps a child to make him my companion(plenty of child-abductors who are not pedophiles do the same thing in real life), then gleefully kills him when he learns he is Frankenstein's brother and frames a servant girl for the murder. In contrast, the film's Creature gently plays with a little girl, but accidentally drowns her, and dies at the hands of a mob who really DON'T have any proof he's guilty, in a scene reminiscent of both a Klan lynching and Christ's crucifixion. Yeah, what an 'unsympathetic' character in comparison to the book(Rolls eyes).Both characters are unpredictable and dangerous, but does Karloff's Creature really come off as unsympathetic just because he doesn't talk endlessly like the novel's monster? Would you rather pity the equivalent of Ted Bundy because he can talk rather than the equivalent of Lenny from Of Mice & Men because he cannot? I also want to point out how, name change and assistant aside, Colin Clive's portrayal of Frankenstein comes closer, personality wise, than any others. Clive is criticized for his hammy It's Alive! line, but in the novel, Frankenstein raves like that for SEVERAL CHAPTERS. This film doesn't take the easy way out by making Frankenstein into a monster-hunting hero(Branagh) or into a 19th century Lex Luthor(Fisher); he's like Shelley's portrayal; basically well-meaning and fully blessed with all any man could want, but secretive, callous, neglectful, and unwilling to see consequences until it's either too late or too early. I think Clive's otherwise restrained portrayal fares better than Branagh's, who overacts It's Alive style in EVERY scene. The fact that Karloff inspires more fear and more pity with a few grunts than De Niro does in Branagh's whole movie is also telling.So what exactly is the problem with Whale's film? It features the most spiritually accurate Dr. Frankenstein ever, drives home the themes of the plot better than any other version, the accusation that the monster is unsympathetic is horse ca ca since he's more sympathetic than he is in the actual novel, so what's to hate? The best answer is to visit the comments section for this movie under hated and the comment's under loved for Branaghs. 99.9% of the complaints are by children who hate it because it's an old movie in black & white, or who make homophobic comment's about James Whale(who was gay). The people who like the Branagh movie mostly just love it because it's in color, or because they are teenage English lit fan girls who think Branagh is hot, and any movie with attractive leads HAS to be better right? If they say they like it because it's more faithful they are lying because they never read it, or did read it but didn't like it, and therefore have no right to demand fidelity to source material they didn't like themselves.This movie isn't perfect, but of the 3 films I've cited as being the best spiritual adaptations, it's the best. Simply; it's the greatest Frankenstein movie ever made as of now.~ ","genre":"Drama, Horror, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"6 March 2009","score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Holy Smoke (1999) ** 1\/2 (out of 4) Extremely bizarre story of a young woman named Ruth (Kate Winslet) who gets involved in an Indian cult, which worries her family. The family brings in a deprogrammer (Harvey Keitel) who is a specialist at breaking young woman who have fallen under the spell of cult members. I can't say this is a totally winning film but it did keep me entertained from start to finish and just when you thought it couldn't get any stranger it certainly does in its second half. This film really isn't about cults but instead the struggles between men and women. The first film has Keitel pulling his magic on Winslet who, in the second half, gets her revenge by putting her hooks into him. Whereas the first film has some sort of religious undertone the second half is a weird sexual journey, which includes Winslet in a full nudity scene, one with her kissing a woman and we even get to see Keitel in a dress walking around a desert in one boot. I'm really not sure what the film is trying to say or if its even trying to say anything at all. Campion is best known for The Piano, which also had Keitel but that film seems normal compared to this one. I've heard people call this a feminist movie, which might be correct but again the ending would lead you to believe this isn't correct. The movie is all over the map in terms of what it's trying to say and do so I guess it's going to be up to the viewer to try and make up their own mind. I'm sure many people will find the film slow and boring but the pacing is what dragged me into the movie and got me caught up with the characters. I think fans of Keitel and Winslet will be the ones walking away entertained because both give great performances and really work well together. Both are so deep into their roles that you can't help but be fascinated by each step they make and in the end they're what saves an otherwise pointless film.
