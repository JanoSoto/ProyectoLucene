The one that was popular with audiences was Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. The one that wasn't popular with audiences was The Wild Bunch. The Wild Bunch made it to my Top 10 favorite list. But, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid was also in the same league as The Wild Bunch. What more can you ask for this picture? Not a whole lot. The story of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is not really true to what happen to the duo, but the movie is sort of a fictional dramatization of the two bank robbers. The movie begins with Butch, (Paul Newman), entering a bank that already starting to close up for the day. It's the 1890's, there's not much left for the world for bandits. Butch loses his chance to rob the bank, however. Meanwhile, his friend, The Sundance Kid,(Robert Redford), is playing a card game with two other men. The big man behind the card game suspects Sundance is cheating. Sundance denies this. To prove that he is the quickest gun around, he demonstrates his talent by shooting the big man's gun out of his hand. The duo then head out of town to meet the Hole-In-The-Wall gang, which is what Butch Cassidy's gang is called, even though realistically, the real Butch Cassidy's gang was called the Wild Bunch. They have already been selected to work with Harvey (Ted Cassidy), instead of Butch. After beating up Harvey, Butch, the Sundance Kid, and the other gang members, decide to rob a train by blowing up one of the train's boxcars. It turns out that the man who is hiding in the boxcar that they have blown up works for E.H. Harriman of the Union Pacific Railroad. But, when a posse of lawmen show up unexpectedly at their robbery, Butch and the Sundance Kid decides that they have no choice but to run from the law. The movie also develop an relationship between the two men and a woman named Etta Place (Katherine Ross). In one particular scene in the movie, Butch and Etta shared a joyful and somewhat sweet moment together as Butch rides a bicycle to the tune of Raindrops are Falling On My Head., sung by Burt Bacharach. That scene works very well because it shows just how joyful it is to watch this movie. When the law becomes too close to bear on, the trio decides to travel to Bolivia, where they are bound to rob banks. They do get lucky, however. Yet, both Butch and Sundance know that their times are closing up for the both of them. Time is short and banks are going for broke. There isn't much more to go around for. The finale of the movie takes place in a plaza, where Butch and Sundance face off against the Bolivian army, who is waiting outside. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is a fun and funny western. It has the charm and wisdom that is fueled by both Paul Newman's and Robert Redford's performances. They like each other in this movie and we like them together. In my opinion, there are probably the best movie buddies since Mel Gibson and Danny Glover team up together in Lethal Weapon. Another reason why this also works in a beautiful way is the cinematography. The cinematography is rich and colorful, with breath-taking shots of canyons and riverbeds. Furthermore, the cinematographer, Conrad L. Hall, won a Oscar for his work in this film. The picture is very good-looking and very beautiful to watch. To me, the movie is sort of a softer version of The Wild Bunch. The reason why is because in The Wild Bunch, there was a hard edge to the story and the characters. It was a lot more violent than this one. This one isn't as violent as The Wild Bunch. In fact, both movies succeeds in making the western genre more pure. The screenplay for this movie is very well-written with funny dialogue in between drastic situations in which Butch and Sundance must figure out a way to elude the Bolivian army. In one particular scene and the most famous scene in the movie is when Butch and Sundance are trapped on a cliff. Below them is a raging river stream. Sundance wants to fight them. But, Butch, keeping a cool head, decide that they should jump into the river. With Butch trying to egg Sundance to jump, Sundance leaves no choice, but to jump into the river. Even the longest curse word ever said in the movie is also heard. A lot of people like this movie, yet there are some who didn't like. I like to know why they didn't like it. It is because of the charm? It is because of the chemistry between Newman and Redford? Is the movie classic in it's own right? I specifically don't know or how anyone would hate this movie. It is a classic. I enjoy so much of what went on during the whole movie. It was fun. It was funny. It was thrilling. It was tragic toward the end. But, above all, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid continues to be one of the best westerns around. It is also one of the best movies of 1969. As for the buddy genre, it would be qualified as being the best buddy movie ever made. Why? Because Newman and Redford are likable throughout this movie. Whether they have to jump into the river or try to rob a Bolivian bank and also command the tellers and people in the bank to put their hands up in Spanish, it all works very well. It's supposed to be enjoyable. Even after 45 years, it still keep on chugging away. ★★★★ 4 stars.

Maybe that's because it has a cast of very good actors and it features an impressive production design.The story A group of explorers happen upon a black hole and wonder why there seems to be a ship just sitting on it's edges. On board they find the ship run by robots and commanded by a Dr. Han Reinhart a scientist missing some twenty years. Only later do we find out that he has turned the entire crew into robots and that he plans to make the black hole his grave.The cast of human heroes aren't given much to do. We get Anthony Perkins, Ernest Borgnine, Robert Forster and Yvette Mimeux who are given the standard roles for this type of film and what they have they play to the hilt (they are after all real actors). The more interesting characters in the film are the robots.Reinhart's operation is guarded by a glowering red menace named Maximillian, who never speaks but his whose whirling metal wrist blades do all his talking for him. The heroes have the bulbous V.I.N.CENT (voiced by the late Roddy McDowell) who speaks eloquently and communicates psychically with Mimeux. Then there is a fellow bulbous trashcan named B.O.B. (who bears a striking resemblance to Cartman from 'South Park') voiced by the late Slim Pickins The best performance in the movie is by Maximillian Schell as Reinhart, as a brilliant but unstable man whose madness seems to have caused him to lose his sense of humanity.What I remember most from 'The Black Hole' is the production design by Peter Ellenshaw. Reinhart's ship looks like an interstellar aircraft carrier envisioned by Gustav Eiffel. The spacescapes are beautiful with the billions of stars all cluttered together across the blue-black infinity of space rather then neatly spaced pinholes in a black curtain. Always looming not too far away is the ominous black hole a swirling celestial whirlpool that we know will eventually have its big scene. I also love John Barry's ominous musical score, which give the scenes an air of dread.I have two problems with 'The Black Hole'. First, is that as much as I admire the production values it is hard to get away from the fact that the movie's story is so standard. The crew finds a madman, discover his secret, he tries to kill them, they shoot it out with his robots as the ship crumbles around them. There really isn't anything at stake in this film.The second problem is the almost fatal flaw of the ending in which inevitably the ship does fall into that black hole. We see this silly metaphysical trip through heaven and hell as Reinhart and Maximillian either make love or physically bond or mind meld &#x96; or something. This scene, stolen from '2001 A Space Odyssey', makes no sense, it looks stupid and doesn't fit with the tone of the rest of the film.'The Black Hole' isn't a terrible movie, and it isn't a great movie either.

The spacescapes are beautiful with the billions of stars all cluttered together across the blue-black infinity of space rather then neatly spaced pinholes in a black curtain. Always looming not too far away is the ominous black hole a swirling celestial whirlpool that we know will eventually have its big scene. I also love John Barry's ominous musical score, which give the scenes an air of dread.I have two problems with 'The Black Hole'. First, is that as much as I admire the production values it is hard to get away from the fact that the movie's story is so standard. The crew finds a madman, discover his secret, he tries to kill them, they shoot it out with his robots as the ship crumbles around them. There really isn't anything at stake in this film.The second problem is the almost fatal flaw of the ending in which inevitably the ship does fall into that black hole. We see this silly metaphysical trip through heaven and hell as Reinhart and Maximillian either make love or physically bond or mind meld &#x96; or something. This scene, stolen from '2001 A Space Odyssey', makes no sense, it looks stupid and doesn't fit with the tone of the rest of the film.'The Black Hole' isn't a terrible movie, and it isn't a great movie either. It stands somewhere in the middle of the road. It has its merits and it had its problems but one doesn't out-weigh the other. Do you have a good time? Yes. Is it memorable?

Sure the whole series is based on a BIG paradox and the movie ignores those that come during its 150 minute runtime unlike Back to the Future series where everything done seems to have a reciprocal change in the future. But as per Steven Hawking's theory once you travel to the past paradoxes are unavoidable and traveling to the past is impossible. Anyway, I have watched this movie plenty of times when i was a kid. All that was exciting to me then was how the T-1000 (Robert Patrick) takes bullets gets fired and frozen but still forms back again. I am still baffled how a machine could be completely liquid without having a programming chip or CPU or something.Though the movie is based on a big logical loop as i call it, you never have the time to think about it as once the movie starts which has great action sequences but what makes this movie remarkable is it circles around 2 basic human aspects 1) A kid's sense of trust (some may call it innocence) &2) A mother's urge (madness) to protect her child, doesn't matter who is trying to harm.The story begins with the arrival of both the terminators and us knowing that john's mother (Linda Hamilton) is in a medical institution for attacking the head quarters of cyberdyme (that will invent skynet). So now the poor kid john (Edward Furlong) does no longer believes in anything his mother lectured repeatedly about the war, judgment day & terminators.Then we have the fight in the mall followed by a chase sequence on the roads which is brilliantly choreographed, it makes perfect use of Arnold Schwarzenegger's (t-800) grace with guns and bikes. Then the boy gets to know about the t-800 and that it has to obey his commands, this starts what i made the movie so good the relation between the boy and the stone face. The boy orders t-800 to come with him to rescue his mom which they succeed (after making the stone face swears not to kill anyone despite it asking why?, of course, i am a terminator).The director also shows the POV of Sarah (john's mom).

She wants to have a normal motherhood but she always has the feeling that some form of harm is nearing her son and that it's inevitable.As the movie proceeds the director does a brilliant job of stringing together some conversations between john and t-800 where the boy talks about his experiences and t-800 quietly listens (but does ask an occasional question why do you cry?). By doing so the director puts us in the position of the terminator he makes us relate directly with the kid and though he gives occasional glimpses of maturity he still is a kid underneath (who else trusts a terminator?).

She believes that it (stone face) will always be there to protect john (we do too) and that in an insane world it was the sanest choice.

That description may be more common in short films, but to describe a feature film made for general release that fits this brief is very rare. I often think how such a film could be made now, in the corporate age of cinema. The answer of course is that it couldn't be; its budget and scope are too big for an independent and its ideas too avant garde and unpopular for a mainstream studio. Imagine trying to sell to a group of executives a film which begins with half an hour of cavemen and no speech, and ends with another half hour of no speech, hypnotic imagery and loud classical music. It would be like Marcel Duchamp pitching a new MacDonald's logo! But enough nostalgia, onto the film. I think what I admire most is the attempt to tell a story that is so complex, the story of human history, of our struggle towards something &#x96; we know not what &#x96; but it is the thing we have mastered technology, language, society, culture and science to try to achieve. In the film it is represented by the monolith, it moves us towards our goal as we try to understand it. The monolith is the question, the why, the how of life. The cavemen are mystified by it, and their solution is the tool. In the near future, space travellers are propelled onwards by it, and then eventually, it is no longer a question of exploring physical space, but transcending it, becoming something more than flesh and bone, allowing consciousness to achieve its great ambition. I would even suggest that all this is in itself a metaphor for the individual search for understanding.Technically, the film is masterful and opened new doors for those who had great visions to put onto the screen. The spinning bone turning into the spaceship is an iconic image, as is the monolith. The use of music is also masterful, in many scenes, especially later in the film, the music becomes the main character, you hear the overture building and it's like the main character returning.And of course there is what is often most remembered in the film, but I would suggests actually operates more as a secondary story, the part of HAL 9000. I recall on first viewing not understanding why this was part of the film, it seemed that there was this great thesis about human endeavour, and then a subplot horror story about a computer gone insane. But I had missed the point, it was still the story of human endeavour, this was the second act, the complicating action, where humanity puts it faith in the machine (as it had done with that bone), only for it to go wrong. I still consider this to be one of the most ambitious films ever made, and I strongly recommend it to anyone.

In the film it is represented by the monolith, it moves us towards our goal as we try to understand it. The monolith is the question, the why, the how of life. The cavemen are mystified by it, and their solution is the tool. In the near future, space travellers are propelled onwards by it, and then eventually, it is no longer a question of exploring physical space, but transcending it, becoming something more than flesh and bone, allowing consciousness to achieve its great ambition. I would even suggest that all this is in itself a metaphor for the individual search for understanding.Technically, the film is masterful and opened new doors for those who had great visions to put onto the screen. The spinning bone turning into the spaceship is an iconic image, as is the monolith. The use of music is also masterful, in many scenes, especially later in the film, the music becomes the main character, you hear the overture building and it's like the main character returning.And of course there is what is often most remembered in the film, but I would suggests actually operates more as a secondary story, the part of HAL 9000.

How to describe a film of such beauty, genius and wit? In my opinion, not only the greatest Chaplin film, but the best comedy film of all time, and a contender for the greatest film of all time.This is Chaplin's attack on modern capitalist society &#x96; attack is the wrong word, as Chaplin never attacks, he is too smart and too kind. He holds up a mirror and says, 'isn't this absurd?' We see the factory owner who constantly increases the speed on the assembly line, resulting in The Tramp being unable to stop wrenching things when he has moved off the machine and causing an uncontrollable twitch; there is the automatic dinner machine to prevent lunch breaks halting productivity; the state removing children from a caring sister in a poor but happy home; the homeless being arrested for stealing bread; the police attack on communists (a grim foreboding of Chaplin's later career). You could include all these areas in a social drama and it would be thought-provoking, but Chaplin puts these things in comedy and it is even more powerful. By representing something in drama, the creator is asking 'have you noticed that this happens in society?' But for something to work in comedy, the creator has to assume we all already know these things occur, he's showing that these things are commonplace, and yet they are absurd. There is even the great visual metaphor when Chaplin literally becomes a cog in the machine.But it's not just the social commentary that makes this film great, it's the beautiful sweetness of Chaplin's films that I love. Take the scene when The Tramp and his new girlfriend find themselves a home, a tiny wooden shack on the edge of a swamp, where a broom holds the roof up, and The Tramp enters and states, 'it's paradise!' Or when he attempts to get arrested, so whilst being held by the policeman (off screen) he helps himself to a cigar and hands out chocolate to children, taken from an unsuspecting shopkeeper trying to promote his goods.Then of course, there are the laughs. A few have already been mentioned, but the scene that, for me, is perhaps the funniest in film history, is the dancing waiter. Chaplin writes the words to a song he must perform on his cuffs, only for them to fly off as he swishes his hands in the opening of the song. His delivery is impeccable, he continues the same smile, unknowing of the situation he is about to enter, and the dramatic irony is genius. We know the problem, and our sympathy is with the poor Tramp, but we can't help but laugh. And so he quickly forms a plan to make up the words by stringing together nonsense French and Italian words (maybe others?) for the ignorant crowd, who lap it up. His delivery and timing of the song are perfect. The first time I saw it, I began by laughing so hard, then pausing and just staring as I realised what a feat of cinematic triumph I was witnessing, and then continued laughing hysterically again.If you're someone who doesn't usually watch films from as long ago as the 1930s, I urge you to reconsider and give it a chance, and this is an excellent place to start. There's a quote which I had wrongly believed was from Einstein but the internet tells me is from folk singer Pete Seeger 'Any darn fool can make something complex; it takes a genius to make something simple.' Modern Times is the epitome of that sentiment, it boils down all the beauty of humanity and the absurdity of society into something sweet, hilarious and moving on the most basic of levels. It's the story of the pursuit of happiness in spite of the world's attempts to derail it, and a statement on the human condition. It is also very, very funny.

I could not have been more wrong. It is not OK. It is mind-bogglingly terrible - without doubt, one of the cheapest, shoddiest pieces of pseudo-hip, plastic, cliché-ridden, overacted rip-off Seventies Z-grade Hollywood garbage ever foisted on an unsuspecting public. The only amusing aspect was that I had watched the superb Shaun of the Dead the night before, and this provided me with a gold-plated example of that old adage about 'chalk and cheese'.And what a horrible, rancid, stinky, mouldy old piece of cheese it is. This frightening mutation of a movie has just everything wrong with it. You'd think you couldn't go far wrong with Matheson's fine original story, but oh no, they had to make it hip in that dreadful, stodgy, cringe-inducing Mod Squad way that only Hollywood in that era could. Everything about it screams 'cheap Seventies 'telemovie', from the script to the sets to the horrible, stagey performances. It looks like it was shot in three days, the 'sets' are SO obviously the Warner backlot, the script is appalling, and it features some of the most spectacularly bad acting in movie history. Chuck's trademark Oh ... my ... god line - uttered when he finds he body of the black kid he'd saved from the plague - is the absolute nadir in a zombie-like performance that rates as one of the very worst in an otherwise fairly distinguished career. The Big Cornpone never had a great range, but to call this a one-note performance is to insult notes. The person I actually feel most sorry for is Rosalind Cash, who was obliged to strip off for no good reason, kiss Charlton Heston (erk!) and utter some of the most tooth-grindingly self-conscious blaxploitation lines ever committed to paper. But hey - no surprises there a quick Google search for writers John and Joyce Corrington reveals a couple so blindingly white- bread that they make Anna Gasteyer and Will Ferrell's SNL school music teacher characters (Bobbi and Marty Culp) look like prime candidates for a Sly & the Family Stone reunion. Even less surprising is the fact that the Corrington's mostly earned their living penning daytime soaps and Z-grade movie schlock-fests like Killer Bees. I should have guessed.A special brickbat goes to TV veteran Anthony Zerbe, an actor every bit as corny as Chuck, and likewise one never known for avoiding a chance to chew the scenery, no matter how flimsy. Granted, he doesn't have much to work with but is just AWFUL - his wig is ridiculous and his acting is worse ... although I have to admit that, in a sterling display of racial equality, Lincoln Kilpatrick's portrayal of his sidekick Zachary is every bit as bad.Also - if the mutants are so anti-technology, where did they get those neatly-tailored lurex cloaks and designer shades? (I know, I know ...)But wait - there's one more dump I have to take on this film ... it's hard to single out the worst thing in a movie so spectacularly rich in bad points, but it leaps out at you from the opening shots - it is the awful, braying, corny score by Ron Grainer. Just ... TERRIBLE. This movie ought to be required viewing in every media course as a textbook example of how NOT to write music for films. It is loud, stupid, intrusive, almost entirely inappropriate\/irrelevant to the action, and just plain BAD music in its own right. It beggars belief that such an experienced and otherwise accomplished screen composer could have turned in such a load of old crap ... but, on the other hand, it suits the movie perfectly, so maybe he got it right after all?In my mind the ONLY reason to watch this film - other than to get wrecked and have a good laugh at its expense - is for the views of downtown Los Angeles ca. 1970, before they totally ruined the place.

I recorded it from TV because I vaguely recalled seeing it back in the '70s, maybe at a drive-in, or perhaps on late-night TV. I also had a vague recollection of it being OK.In hindsight, I think I must have been absolutely off my face at the time, because, oh, how my memory had deceived me ... I could not have been more wrong. It is not OK. It is mind-bogglingly terrible - without doubt, one of the cheapest, shoddiest pieces of pseudo-hip, plastic, cliché-ridden, overacted rip-off Seventies Z-grade Hollywood garbage ever foisted on an unsuspecting public. The only amusing aspect was that I had watched the superb Shaun of the Dead the night before, and this provided me with a gold-plated example of that old adage about 'chalk and cheese'.And what a horrible, rancid, stinky, mouldy old piece of cheese it is. This frightening mutation of a movie has just everything wrong with it. You'd think you couldn't go far wrong with Matheson's fine original story, but oh no, they had to make it hip in that dreadful, stodgy, cringe-inducing Mod Squad way that only Hollywood in that era could. Everything about it screams 'cheap Seventies 'telemovie', from the script to the sets to the horrible, stagey performances. It looks like it was shot in three days, the 'sets' are SO obviously the Warner backlot, the script is appalling, and it features some of the most spectacularly bad acting in movie history. Chuck's trademark Oh ... my ... god line - uttered when he finds he body of the black kid he'd saved from the plague - is the absolute nadir in a zombie-like performance that rates as one of the very worst in an otherwise fairly distinguished career. The Big Cornpone never had a great range, but to call this a one-note performance is to insult notes.

Dr. Strangelove is magnificent on all fronts, the acting, writing, direction, sets, music, it's all flawless.To begin, let's consider Sellers' three roles. Colonel Mandrake is superb, Sellers downplays the character perfectly in the style of the traditional British military officer. The marvellous thing is watching what he doesn't say he is faced with insanity, but he cannot lose his decorum, so he often stumbles over the beginning of a sentence, as though he'd considered something more assertive but thought it impolite. The scenes between him and Colonel Ripper are my favourites, both are so under-acted, there is so much silence and darkness, it's as though time slows down; in this room are two individuals, one completely underwhelming and one truly insane, who will decide the fate of the world. For me the greatest point in the film is Hayden's delivery of the line 'I can no longer sit back and allow Communist infiltration, indoctrination, subversion and the international Communist conspiracy to sap and impurify all of our precious bodily fluids.' The pauses accumulate as the line goes on, until at the end when each word dangles one at a time before you, each second you realise how insane Ripper is, and of course it's met with Mandrake's response that so perfectly displays a look of equal parts confusion, condescension and terror. What's so great about Hayden's performance as Ripper, unlike so many performances of psychopaths, what makes him scary is that there is no self-recognition of the craziness, he truly believes every word (note the superb camera and lighting in this scene, the Dutch angle below Ripper's desk, the half-shadow on his face, the camera doesn't waver a millimetre during the speech, and the only distraction is the punctuation of the cigar smoke). But I think the real stellar moment of these scenes, in terms of acting, comes towards the end, when Ripper realises all is lost and he asks Mandrake if he's ever been tortured. Sellers delivers this scene perfectly. There is a mixture of true modesty, shame, fear, regret, but most of all a sense of something being too painful to remember, Mandrake isn't trying to be brave, he just pushes on, an embodiment of the 'stiff upper lip'.The other great partnership in the film is Sellers as President Muffley and Scott as General Turgidson (though perhaps I should make note of the other great back-and-forth, Sellers vs Sellers on the phone to the Kremlin, probably the greatest piece of improvisation in film history). George C. Scott is truly outstanding in these scenes; he's a schoolboy who's been put in charge of the most powerful military in the world. But the character is more complex than this he's intelligent, in that he's informed and forward-thinking, he walks the President into the strategies he has planned, revealing pieces of information bit by bit. In many ways it's the absurdity of the situation they all find themselves in that creates the absurdity in the man. Sellers plays the straight-man in these scenes and works so well with Scott (although, Sellers actually gets some of the great laugh out loud moments, the famous 'you can't fight in here, this is the war room', and the phone call to the Kremlin, such a genuine representation of speaking to a drunk person, 'I'm fine, you're fine&#x85; yes as you say we're both fine'). Again, a note for the camera work, each shot is held for a long time while each man speaks, they tend not to track but to simply frame and allow the characters to move around in a set space. There is the surrounding darkness, with the slow movement of the dots on the big board, providing a constant reminder of the ticking bomb.And then of course there's the titular character, the Nazi scientist (most probably an import from Operation Paperclip) who seizes the chance to allow his eugenic master plan to come to fruition. Yes, the battle with the arm is one of the great slapstick scenes in cinema (note the Russian ambassador can barely hold in his laughs), but listen to Sellers' delivery as well, the way he emphasises words has a great subtlety to it. There's something I find mystifying about this scene, there's a real sense of waiting for the end to hit. Throughout there has been a back and forth between Ripper's base, the War Room and the B-52 which has kept pace in the film, and when the Strangelove scene comes afterwards, it's exceptionally quiet, there's very little interruption, only a few lines from Sellers as President and Scott. It speaks to the insanity of the Cold War, that the world is ending and all these powerful men can do is sit and make silly plans that will never happen.and I've not even mentioned the B-52 scenes, Major Kong as the cowboy who's no longer in command of a horse and revolver, but a B-52 and a hydrogen bomb. Kubrick is one of my favourite directors, and I think this is his finest moment. I mentioned in my review of Modern Times how powerful it can be to say something through comedy rather than drama, how it forces us to take its absurdities for granted rather than to focus on them, and I would say that it's one thing if you can tell someone that the world is insane and we're plummeting towards our own doom, and it's altogether more incredible if you can make them laugh about it. Dr. Strangelove sits alongside films such as Citizen Kane, The Godfather and Sunset Boulevard as one of those films where everything just comes together perfectly, all aspects complement the overall goal. Kubrick's vision is genius but it's also down to the brilliance of the cast and crew that make this film so good.

Is a kids film, fact. But is not only a kids film, is a kids film that is considered one of the greatest films of all-time, acclaimed critically and a great success on the box office...wow, right?No, no really. This film may have been good in the time it was released, I mean, there are a lot of '80s values' on it, and I understand, it talks about the 'magic' of the childhood...but, it talked strictly for the 80s generation, I mean, for an older and different audience, there is simply no way to connect with this film at all. It's dull, outdated, and totally uninteresting. The characters are shallow, so I couldn't care less for them. And again, very dull. The film is about kids doing dull things, so despite the story being technically perfect for the 80s standards, nowadays it's just a boring film with nothing to offer for the newer audiences.I also disliked the soundtrack. So annoying and sketch. It was used in the film to.attenuate the scenes, and it don't worked anytime. And I almost walked out in the most bizarrely manipulative moment of the film, the ending, much because of the John Williams horrible music.The E.T is very similar to the weird baby in Eraserhead(David Lynch, 1978), I found this detail pretty interesting. But all in all, not deserving of it's classic status. 5.0\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"15 February 2014","score":"2 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" E.T, a so-called great film by Steven Spielberg.

For me, it's his facial expressions. He is the master at portraying reactions by a mild mannered everyman overwhelmed by immediate circumstances.Rene Zellwegger was a mildly cute Texas girl-next-door several years before this one. In this one, set in San Francisco, her Texas accent and tomboyish outrage is not appealing.But she is supposed to be a fed-up girlfriend, so I guess she does it well.I envied the main character. How great would it be to look like him, have a guaranteed easy job for life at a pool table manufacturer in San Francisco, owned by his own family, and then inherit a bunch of money? I've met guys like that, who cruise along in auto-pilot with their looks, casual demeanor, and money.The sidekick character played by Artie Lang was so over-the-top obnoxious! I couldn't take it. That's his real life personality, so he wasn't acting. It was also excruciating to see classic actors like Ed Asner and Hal Holbrook play old fools in a romantic comedy for young people. It seemed degrading.I loved the imagery of single men being lassoed by a cowboy rope as symbolic of being trapped by the need to marry.I also thought the famous thousand brides scene was well done. I particularly liked the initial part of it at the church, when Chris is answering their questions about his preferences. Brooke Shields looks old and hard. Don't expect much, although she played her role well.I thought there was just the right amount of character development. You don't want too much in a RomCom. If you can stand Artie Lang,give this picture a viewing on a rainy day.
