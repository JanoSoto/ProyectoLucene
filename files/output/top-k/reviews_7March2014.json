Just because it has screwball in the genre of comedy it is doesn't mean it is bad. In fact I found this movie much funnier than most comedies today. After watching this screwball comedy I started to search through all the other screwball comedies made at the time just because of this one.This film holds many good qualities of a comedy. The story itself starts out with a woman taking a poor man off the street and making him a butler after some other events leading to that. She herself though falls in love with the man she barely knows and yet he rejects her she isn't giving up easy. Even though he told her of his position as a butler and that he had no interest in a relationship with her she still keeps him close by. In some ways she will put in a quick kiss that really is like less than a second. That is one thing that sticks out in this movie is that there was no high emotions of love towards the two characters.The camera work and lighting during the film are as a good as the story. The bulk of the film is in a huge house that the family lives in and where the butler works. The house is large and needs a lot of light but is kept well lit through the whole film. Even showing the life on the streets has so much detail to make you believe you did fall right in the dump. With such good acting as a gentleman from William Powell keeps the entire atmosphere of the film in a positive out look of life. As he first was poor is now working and getting income as a butler, this makes you cheer for the poor man to continue his dream as being successful.All and all this was just a great movie that made me watching closely until the end.

It's sweet, charming, and funny and that's what I expect from these films. It also happens to bring back some nostalgia in me especially when every social group is explained in the film.Gil Junger's film is about a new student at school, Cameron who happens to fall this pretty girl named Bianca.

Meanwhile, this thug named Patrick gets paid to take out Bianca's older sister, the ill-tempered Kat.

Yet what sounds like a weakness might be the film's greatest asset and what most contributed its success, besides the name of the director, the titular hero and the fact that it was the second opus of the highest-grossing film made three years before.Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is perhaps the most cinematic movie ever made, and it's not surprising that Steven Spielberg directed it, the fans will love him and the haters will hate him even more after watching Doom. Of course, chances are that the fans would still prefer Raiders of the Lost Ark, but why? Was it more realistic or less fantastic? Was the portrayal of all the Germans as cruel and cunning Nazis more acceptable than Hindus as monkey-brains eaters or Satanist-cult followers? No, sir, if Doom has at least one merit is to confront the fans to the fact that Indiana Jones is a series not to be taken seriously.And Spielberg follows this pattern with a delightful sense of excess, to the point that the film constantly flirts with parody. Indy is cooler and funnier, the obligatory female element incarnated by the screaming nightclub singer Willie (Kate Capshaw) whose status set the fights of feminism many decades back (thanks 'Watchmojo') and Round-Trip, the Chinese boy, a sidekick who could have been an annoying comic relief if it wasn't for his heart-breaking I love you, Indy near the end. Spielberg was dying to make an adventure of Tintin, but before the dream would come true 27 years after, and because of the passing of Herge in 1983, his reference to Tintin's friend Chang was his wink to the Master.And I like to see Round-Trip (rememeber, he was the geeky Data in The Goonies) as Spielberg's allegiance to Tintin, to Herge's paternity, although there was already some Tintinesque stuff in Raiders of the Lost Ark. But Doom borrows more from the earlier Tintin's albums the mission, set in India, is rather simplistic, taking back a sacred stone stolen from a village of poor peasants, who lost all their children in the process. Indy discovers later that they were enslaved in a mysterious temple ruled by an evil Thuggee priest. Indeed, even by Tintin's standards, the film is rudimentary. But at least, it never lies about its premise. Right from the beginning, in Shanghai's ballroom scene, the film shows some glimpses of comedy and even slapstick totally absent from the first film.It's pretty obvious that Harrison Ford grew more confidence toward his character, as he did with his no-less iconic Han Solo. Ford portrays Indy as if he knew he was exposing his aura to a group of old friends who missed him after a three-year absence, and this is exactly what Spielberg does. The references to the first film includes also the hat signature shot, I would have loved to see a parody where the hand gets crushed under the door for once. And right near the end, Jones tries to reprise his gun' trick against the evil Army, until he realizes he has no gun, it doesn't work but the gag does. The comedy is really a relief after so many actions scenes, and 'Indiana Jones' is a character that can't do without comedy. It's the alibi of its deliberate campiness.But this leads me to the key element that make the film worth to watch, an abundance of action scenes, it's like Aliens for Alien, it simply never stops, apart from a few romantic interludes or the infamous dinner scene meant to let the viewers catch their breath or digest their popcorn, (well, I don't think they'd eat anything during that part) the film is pure thrills from beginning to end, from the snow sequence to the cart mine chase, with a longer trip in the disturbing temple, that might discomfort some younger viewers. If not the best, Doom definitely deserves the title of creepiest movie of the franchise, establishing Spielberg's craftsmanship when it comes to inspire us very specific reactions.I had the feeling that the film was maybe too intense but after a second thought, I understood the following point, since it's deprived from any intellectual substance, Doom couldn't be anything but an action film, and Spielberg knew that. A character like Willie, whose existence is due to Spielberg's marriage with Kate Capshaw, had only one purpose being saved by Indy (and saving his life once) therefore, danger had to be everywhere, but I wonder if he wasn't tempted to let her drop in that mountain of lava. At least, Round Trip had some skills, and we'll never thank him enough for saving Indy.Anyway, Temple of Doom is the film the word 'spectacular' has been invented for, it's very telling when the most impressive action sequence isn't the climax, although the bridge scene is pretty memorable, it wasn't as thrilling and heart-pounding as the escape on the cart mine with the water playing the role of the infamous boulder. Roger Ebert called it a 'forearm bruiser' referring to the fact that your girlfriend would grab your arm several times, well, I didn't see in the movie theaters, but I understand why the film was the highest grossing. The rest of it, analysis of accuracies and all that stuff is just as superficial and futile as the object of their accusation.Again, would you take seriously a film whose final gag is an elephant splashing water at a kissing couple? It's obviously cartoons' stuff, but that's what Doom is, a great live-action cartoon, and just because it doesn't have the pretension to be anything else, I give it a slight edge over Raiders of the Lost Ark.

One has to look no further than the 1989 opus, Look Who's Talking, and subsequent trilogy, to see how dynamic the formula translates to film. Ten years later, this breathtaking film was released. Baby Geniuses is just that a genius work of film starring babies. From the hilarious in-your-face comedy styling of triplet actors Leo, Myles, and Gerry Fitzgerald, to the haunting performance as the Cruella-Deville-inspired villain Dr. Elena Kinder, played by the venerated Kathleen Turner.I'll admit I was skeptical. When I embarked on my initial viewing, I had certain preconceived notions about the nature of babies and their intellect that hindered my enjoyment. After my third or fourth screening, I was hooked. It's all based on the ancient belief that children are born with advanced conceptions of the universe that are lost by the time they enter into the adult world. This long-held belief by many Eastern religions has been shunned and avoided in film for decades. Baby Geniuses, at its heart a social film about the nuclear family and child slavery, confronts the issue head on. This fearless script, endlessly researched, jumps from the actors mouths and rattles the viewer to their core. What begins as an interesting piece of humorous science fiction, ends with a death-defying, heart-pounding final scene as actor Peter MacNicol, who performs all of his own stunts in the film, dangles from the rope of a helicopter&#x97;every second ascending, every second pulling him from a safe landing &#x96; a phobia that millions of Americans struggle with day-to-day. I should also mention this film's ahead-of-it's-time visual effects. With limited technology at their disposal, seeing that production was completed in 1998, the team of computer animation experts were able to truly wow me with the babies' seamlessly advanced dexterity and speech. I'm not typically one to conjecture on movie magic and try to decode how certain shots were pulled off, but I do believe that they must have used some sort of puppets on strings and then digitally replaced the heads of the characters, specifically in the now famous John Travolta homage scene.

I still like this guy's work, he can still get a laugh out of me but I'd be lying if I said his films don't have problems.The plot is pretty much an abortion clinic worker is asked by the angels of Heaven to stop 2 renegades from getting back into heaven because existence is based on the principle that God must never be proved wrong. She gets the help of Jay and Silent Bob and the 13th Apostle named Rufus.Here's my biggest problem with the movie. Kevin Smith in this movie combines both his sort of humour and philosophical questions on religion. To be honest he does nothing wrong with either element, but once they are put together it just doesn't fit. It's like getting scenes from The Seventh Seal while watching Monty Python, both are good at what they do but they work horribly together.With this said it's still an entertaining watch. I mean if you don't find Kevin Smith funny then I don't think this will change your opinion of him in any way shape or form. However if you do find him funny then it's not like Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back where he uses F-bombs in every sentence with the hopes of getting a laugh, not to say there isn't anything resembling that in this movie.So if you can get past combining something stupid with something intelligent muddled together then you'll probably like this movie more than I did. I don't see anything wrong with either but it just really doesn't work together, or at least not that well. So at the end of the day, because yes it did make me laugh and yes it did make me think about religion, this deserves a solid 7\/10.

Brooks that stands out thanks to some wonderful performances and memorable characters. As Good As it Gets is proof that actions are louder than words because despite how cruel and mean Nicholson's character is, he does incredible and kind things for others. In a way this film reminded me of David O. Russell's Silver Linings Playbook as I found both films to be difficult to follow at first due to the lack of a likable character, but once we get to know who these people are we forgive their flaws and end up routing for them. Both Nicholson and Helen Hunt give excellent performances, and their Oscar wins were well deserved in my opinion. As Good As it Gets is the very definition of charm, and the screenplay written by Mark Andrus (Life As a House) shines thanks to some incredible performances. I really enjoyed this film and found myself laughing through most of the scenes. This is one more film I can eliminate from my shame list, and I'm glad I finally got to experience this romantic comedy which also has a lot to say about overcoming illness.We are introduced to Melvin Udall (Jack Nicholson), a cranky but successful author who suffers from OCD. He lives on his own in a beautiful apartment where he spends most of his time writing. He always goes out on his daily breakfast ritual which consists of walking to a nearby cafe without touching anyone or stepping on any cracks. He always sits in the same place at the cafe and always demands to be served by the same waitress, whose name is Carol (Helen Hunt). Carol is actually the only one in the cafe who stands his constant outbursts and cruel comments. Melvin's daily routine changes through two events that end up affecting his life. First, his homosexual artist neighbor named Simon (Greg Kinnear) suffers an accident and Melvin unwillingly accepts to take care of his dog in his absence. Second, Carol's son, Spencer (Jesse James) gets ill and she quits her job. Not accepting the fact that Carol isn't there to serve him, Melvin tries to find her in order to restore order back to his life. These series of events force Melvin to change his routine and at the same time he forms an unlikely friendship with Carol and Simon proving that he isn't as bad as he seems to be.The performances by each one of the talented actors are the heart and motor of this film. Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt share an incredible chemistry together. It's funny how despite never being able to share his feelings towards her and always saying the wrong things, it becomes clear that she does inspire him to become a better person. The supporting cast is also incredible here, especially Greg Kinnear and Cuba Gooding Jr. who deliver several funny scenes. I was partial to Brooks's work considering I had only seen How Do You Know which didn't work for me and Spanglish which I did enjoy, but As Good As it Gets is without a doubt his best work thanks to an unbelievable cast. This is a smart and funny film, which also could be cruel at times, but it was well balanced. Despite the schmaltzy story it still worked thanks to the characters that carried this film. It's hard not to leave this film with a smile on your face.

His ugly ginger son takes his place but also gets wounded so he's taken by good knight Quaid to a Scottish dragon which can heal humans apparently. He is healed and made to promise he will be good unlike his father, well he lies and turns out even worse, didn't see that coming huh. This angers Quaid as he feels the dragon twisted the young Kings heart so he vows revenge on all dragons.The catch is that further down the line Quaid's knight realises that a worth while deal can be struck with the dragon for monetary gain. So they begin a partnership where the dragon scares the poor dumb peasants and Quaid rides in and saves them...for a few pieces of gold.So the film is set in olde England and does have a reasonable realistic approach in that sense, or at least they try. Problem being the film doesn't look anything like England but in fact looks exactly like where they shot it, eastern Europe. I did get the feeling that most of the budget for this film was used on creating the CGI dragon as everything else looks pretty poor really. This King only seems to be King of a small valley, there is no other mention of the rest of England or any other people outside this valley. His castle is pokey, he doesn't seem to have many troops, there seems to be more peasants than troops or even buildings to house them, everyone wears the same outfits all the time, the wigs are all obvious and hilariously bad and the film keeps circling around the same grassy\/rocky areas over and over.The effects at the time were big, they were big time effects believe me, this film garnered much attention because of its CGI dragon. Looking back now its nicely done on the whole but obviously with time the cracks are now evident and the CGI shines through. There are some nice shots when 'Draco' is wet and when he breathes fire, plus the flying sequences are quite good but when he chats with humans it becomes a bit iffy. And yes Draco is his name, draco the dragon, surely they could come up with something a bit more original?.The idea of a knight and a dragon teaming up for a living during the medieval period is a good one but it doesn't quite feel fully serviced here. We only get a very very bare bones look at other peasants, other villages and how they go about this agreement. No sooner have we seen one badly interpreted village scam the plot goes off down this rebellion route against the evil young King. We then get a very very very average looking final battle sequence against...I dunno, about 50 horseback troops and about 100 peasants who were conveniently trained up in the art of war not more than a few hours before.There isn't really any decent lore in this film either, nothing on dragons much. The fact Draco can speak is hugely important I would of thought, it shows he is an intelligent beast, not just a dumb killing machine, surely humans could learn a great deal from this creature. I also want to know if all dragons can speak in this universe, they clearly have magic powers and possible immortality with a human, sheesh there is loads to discover here but we get nothing!. Why on earth would people wanna kill all these super intelligent sentient beings off?!!.It really does all feel a bit low rent...accept for the dragon. In fact the dragon is the best thing in the film really, Quaid looks bad in his blonde wig, Dina Meyer looks ridiculous in her peasant garb, Isaacs is wasted, Postlethwaite is also wasted but Thewlis is actually a decent slimy King...in a bad ginger wig. The choice of Connery as Draco is a good one, no complaints there, in fact its perfect.A fun cheerful fantasy with a surprisingly stirring orchestral score no doubt, but looking back its all very hokey and quite poorly made if you look closer.

That being said, I can't dismiss it completely due to the truly interesting choice of a main character.

My Man Godfrey introduces their lead in a sorry state, living in a garbage dump and face full of scruff.

Given that this movie was made at a time when the majority of Americans were experiencing hardship, Godfrey probably served as someone to relate to and look up to for many.I also found the relationship between Godfrey and Cornelia fascinating. It made me wish that she was the main female love interest instead of her rather goofy and hysterical sister. Yes, there was a sweetness to the fact that Irene, even in her spoiled state, saw past what he was and looked upon Godfrey as a person. But all the same, I think there was a far more interesting story to tell in Cornelia and Godfrey if they had focused more on her journey to realizing he was more than just a bum, but an exceptional man.

Thanks to a sharp and witty script and entertaining characters True Romance was extremely cool. The best way I can describe this film is to take Patricia Arquette's character's words and sound like a broken record all I could think of while watching this film was Quentin Tarantino you are so cool; Tony Scott you are so cool; every single actor in this film you are so cool, True Romance you are so cool. I can't believe I had to wait 21 years to get around to watching this considering how big of a Quentin Tarantino fan I am (and I'm also a huge fan of Tony Scott's work in Man on Fire). Tarantino's energetic script and Scott's stylized direction blended perfectly in this near masterpiece. The cast is absolutely brilliant here and there are so many memorable characters and scenes in this film. I think I enjoyed this film more watching it for the first time now than if I would have seen it in 1993 considering there are so many familiar faces that I probably wouldn't have recognized back then. Brad Pitt, Val Kilmer, Dennis Hopper, Gary Oldman, Christopher Walken, Samuel L. Jackson, James Gandolfini, and Chris Penn all have small but memorable roles. Oldman is barely recognizable playing a pimp with dreadlocks and a glass eye, but it is a unique performance. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette give the performance of their careers here; it's a shame Slater has been in so many terrible films in the past decade because his performance here was promising. Arquette is adorable as Alabama and I can't think of another sweeter performance than hers. There is so much energy and charm in this film that it's hard to resist. Like good wine, True Romance will probably age better over time considering I couldn't believe how much fun I was having watching an early 90's film for the first time. True Romance you are so cool!Clarence Worley (Christian Slater) is a comic book store clerk who also happens to be a martial arts film buff. He plans to spend his birthday as he always does, at the movies, watching a triple feature of Sonny Chiba. What he doesn't expect is that he will find the love of his life there. While he is watching the film, a pretty woman walks into the theater spilling her popcorn all over him. She apologizes and introduces herself as Alabama (Patricia Arquette). The two fall in love with each other after she opens up to him about her true identity. This leads them through a series of dangerous adventures involving pimps (Gary Oldman), the Sicilian mafia (Christopher Walken, James Gandolfini), drug dealers (Samuel L. Jackson), police officials (Chris Penn, Tom Sizemore), and Hollywood producers (Saul Rubinek, Bronson Pinchot). The film is full of energy and thrills as the two lovers face several obstacles along the way. Thankfully, Clarence seems to have a mentor on his side to guide him an apparition of his idol Elvis Presley (Val Kilmer) who is sort of his conscious.Even if you aren't a huge fan of Tarantino you could still enjoy True Romance for all the beloved actors in this film that weren't probably big Hollywood names back then. The film moves so quickly and the script is so energetic that It makes for a very entertaining watch. There are so many memorable scenes in this film, like the face off between Gary Oldman and Christian Slater, the group Mexican standoff, and the violent hotel scene involving Gandolfini and Arquette, but the real scene stealer would have to be the one in which Dennis Hopper, who plays Clarence's father, is ambushed by Christopher Walken and his gang and they have a not so friendly chat about Sicilians. It was a pure Tarantino moment and there are a lot of these great dialogues that allow for the film to have such a great pace and move along so nicely. The style and characters in this film make it such a unique experience and film lovers will enjoy the Hollywood satire as well. I am so glad I finally got to see this wild and romantic film. This is another reason why Tony Scott will be missed.

Oldman is barely recognizable playing a pimp with dreadlocks and a glass eye, but it is a unique performance. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette give the performance of their careers here; it's a shame Slater has been in so many terrible films in the past decade because his performance here was promising. Arquette is adorable as Alabama and I can't think of another sweeter performance than hers. There is so much energy and charm in this film that it's hard to resist. Like good wine, True Romance will probably age better over time considering I couldn't believe how much fun I was having watching an early 90's film for the first time. True Romance you are so cool!Clarence Worley (Christian Slater) is a comic book store clerk who also happens to be a martial arts film buff. He plans to spend his birthday as he always does, at the movies, watching a triple feature of Sonny Chiba. What he doesn't expect is that he will find the love of his life there. While he is watching the film, a pretty woman walks into the theater spilling her popcorn all over him. She apologizes and introduces herself as Alabama (Patricia Arquette). The two fall in love with each other after she opens up to him about her true identity. This leads them through a series of dangerous adventures involving pimps (Gary Oldman), the Sicilian mafia (Christopher Walken, James Gandolfini), drug dealers (Samuel L. Jackson), police officials (Chris Penn, Tom Sizemore), and Hollywood producers (Saul Rubinek, Bronson Pinchot). The film is full of energy and thrills as the two lovers face several obstacles along the way. Thankfully, Clarence seems to have a mentor on his side to guide him an apparition of his idol Elvis Presley (Val Kilmer) who is sort of his conscious.Even if you aren't a huge fan of Tarantino you could still enjoy True Romance for all the beloved actors in this film that weren't probably big Hollywood names back then. The film moves so quickly and the script is so energetic that It makes for a very entertaining watch. There are so many memorable scenes in this film, like the face off between Gary Oldman and Christian Slater, the group Mexican standoff, and the violent hotel scene involving Gandolfini and Arquette, but the real scene stealer would have to be the one in which Dennis Hopper, who plays Clarence's father, is ambushed by Christopher Walken and his gang and they have a not so friendly chat about Sicilians. It was a pure Tarantino moment and there are a lot of these great dialogues that allow for the film to have such a great pace and move along so nicely. The style and characters in this film make it such a unique experience and film lovers will enjoy the Hollywood satire as well. I am so glad I finally got to see this wild and romantic film. This is another reason why Tony Scott will be missed.

Thanks to a sharp and witty script and entertaining characters True Romance was extremely cool. The best way I can describe this film is to take Patricia Arquette's character's words and sound like a broken record all I could think of while watching this film was Quentin Tarantino you are so cool; Tony Scott you are so cool; every single actor in this film you are so cool, True Romance you are so cool. I can't believe I had to wait 21 years to get around to watching this considering how big of a Quentin Tarantino fan I am (and I'm also a huge fan of Tony Scott's work in Man on Fire). Tarantino's energetic script and Scott's stylized direction blended perfectly in this near masterpiece. The cast is absolutely brilliant here and there are so many memorable characters and scenes in this film.

Thad is critically acclaimed but far from a best seller. Writing under the pseudonym George Stark, Thad writes trashy violent novels that just happen to sell better than his own. A Blackmailer threatens to expose his other identity so Thad goes Public with the information in hopes of burying his alter ego. Instead, Thad's dark half which is George Stark takes on a life of his own and is bent on destroying Thad's world and everyone connected to him. Stark is soon stalking Thad's agents' friends and slashing them to ribbons with a razor. Horror Veteran George A. Romero adapts Stephen king's novel and directs here. Romero wisely keeps the audience wondering if it is Thad blacking out and committing these crimes, or has his mind actually released this killer into the real world. Timothy Hutton is wonderful in the dual role and has the talent to make a menacing glance be actually scary. There are multiple scare scenes that work very well. Such as when Thad's agent Miriam (Rutanya Alda) comes home puts her key in the door and it slowly opens. The audience is on the edge of their seat and they know they're going to get it, but Romero's timing is so good he gets the Jump scare anyway. There is an excellent dream sequence that is scary as well. The effects are top notch and Romero makes the attacks very violent and gory. There is a delicious sequence in a hallway that is just dripping with mood and atmosphere. All though the end result of the story is a bit much to swallow, 'The Dark Half' works as a first rate horror film.

The Starks had recently moved in to LA and are keen for their son to make some friends and stay out of trouble, which seems to follow him wherever he may be. The next morning, however, Jim and this bully named Buzz, argue with each other and eventually decide to settle it in a game of Chickie Run. Things don't go according to plan and now Jim has to deal with the consequences and try to finally do the right thing.James Dean stars as Jim Stark. And even though Dean was seven years older than the character he's playing, he gives a solid performance for the time. Seeing Dean in his iconic attire and with his hair slicked back, you can't help but tell yourself Man, this guy is cool. He doesn't look anything like a seventeen year old but his screen presence makes you forget that. You just want to see this guy do his thing. Also starring are Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo, who both got nominated for Academy Awards for best supporting Actress and Actor respectively. Also, a young Dennis Hopper makes his acting debut.I think it's both fair and unfair to say the movie got so much recognition because of Dean's death. Fair because it's true that when an actor dies, the movie they last worked on gets more attention (Like The Dark Knight after Heath Ledger or The Crow after Brandon Lee). Unfair because this really is a good movie. A lot of people who watch it nowadays will say that it's dated. But if you consider that it came out nearly sixty years ago, it was like nothing they've ever seen before.Rebel without a Cause is a classic. Anyone who likes movies has at least heard of it.
