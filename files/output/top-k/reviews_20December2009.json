And its rating is one of the most odd ones in IMDb history, every time I bother about it, when visit the page of the movie. Mimi Leder is not a well known director sadly. I saw Deep Impact in 2000 or 2001 and liked it so much. Especially the scenes which the meteor comes down to the earth were dazzling and glorious. However, The Peacemaker is her masterpiece. George Clooney is great in this film, he is a great actor, especially his mimics. Yes, any actor can play this role, Thomas Devoe, but Clooney is a gift I believe. Action? A critic says that The Peacemaker is one of slow paced movies, so in the bonus disc, in the behind the scenes part, we can watch making of two action scenes. A big lie! How many action scenes does The Peacemeker have? Let's count. The first action sequence is a car chase. This scene is so stylish. Mimi Leder chose a cloudy, rainy day to shoot this part, the cinematography consists of gray tones mainly. The background music is sweeping, the crash moments are very strong, and generally it is not showy. Thomas Devoe squeezes the car almost. The second long action sequence occurs on the air and then in an aircraft. The third action sequence (attention, I always use sequence, not scene) takes place in New York. In those scenes, Leder catches dazzling panoramic views. And this time, she chose a sunny day. However, there is a thought provoking and frustrating scene. There is a little girl who obstructs the visual angle of the sniper, but Clooney and Kidman insist him to shoot. Returning to the action, the camera follows Clooney while he is jumping from one car to another, then makes a half rotation around him. Brilliant! The gunfight scene recalls John Woo movies. From the deliberately made opening sequence till the end, a solid thriller.

You know it's bad for you, but you can't help yourself.Howard (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a workaholic salesman who neglects his wife and son. He promises to make up for it by getting his son's Christmas present, a Turbo Man doll. The problem is he left his Christmas shopping to last minute and ends up trying to get the most popular toy on Christmas Eve. He ends up going through hell, fighting grannys, nearly getting arrested, and ends up competing with a mad postman (Sinbad) and his next door neighbour and divorced superdad Ted (Phil Hartman (Troy McClure and Lionel Hutz from the Simpsons)). Howard tests his own moral compass to discover the true meaning of Christmas.Of course this film was never going to be very good, it's a slapstick, family comedy with one of the most wooden actors staring in it. The only modern Christmas movie I like is Elf. But as I said this film is so bad and so cheesy that you end up watching and laughing for all the wrong reasons. It's such cheap humour that it's unbelievable. I love to know what financial trouble that Arnold Schwarzenegger must have been in to do this movie? He was one of the biggest movie stars in the world at the time, staring in the Terminator Series, Conan series, Predator, True Lies and Total Recall, to this. I know he was trying to branch out of the action genre to do comedy films, but that really was a mistake. Arnie was not a comedic actor. Even the great Phil Hartman was unfunny in this film which is sad to say.The writing may as well been down by a computer, it was weak and robotic. Possibly a few words words was typed in and the writer just came up with a cheap screenplay. Empire have described the director Brian Levant as the worst directors in Hollywood. This is the man who made a career making lazy family comedies, Beethoven, The Flintstones (ruining a classic cartoon), Snow Dogs and Are We Done Yet (a sequel to a rubbish film in the first place). All his films just focus on bad slapstick. Luckily he doesn't have much of a career now.Entertaining for all the wrong reasons.

The direction by Spielberg is confidant and calm when it needs to be but also ferociously intense when there is a need for it. For every explosion and gun-fight there is a quiet moment between the characters which is just as worthwhile if not more and Robert Rodat's screenplay is pitch-perfect. Janusz Kaminski is one of the finest cinematographers alive and he brings the story alive in exquisite detail. The first twenty-minutes which show the famed D-Day landings is one of the most spectacular and haunting pieces of footage ever caught on film. There are many reasons I love the film but what brought the film down for me was essentially the story. There was no lack of it or too much of it and it was interesting but when Spielberg is fighting for believability in these shots I did not believe it with the story as a back-drop. The story goes that after Damon's brothers are killed around the globe on the same day the army wants to send him home to his mother and sends a group led by Hanks to find him and send him home.

Three years pass whereupon he's been reduced to living above a video store where he also works and lives with his long-suffering girlfriend\/boss (Ruehl).In a drunken stumble through town, he happens upon Williams and his merry band of homeless knuckleheads. Bridges does the bug-eye thing during his initial stay in Williams' hideout, where ol' Robin does his usual rapid-fire insane act he had become so associated with. After discovering he has a connection to Williams' past, Bridges feels guilted into looking after the demented loon as best he can.The first 20 minutes of this ain't so bad, before it segues into the usual Gilliam flair for the bizarre. Wild camera angles and musical numbers permeate the storytelling, but writer LaGravenese saves that by adding a depth not commonly scene with this genre. There are factual statements about men, women, life, death, salvation, friendship, etc. Though too many moments are somewhat predictable (you just know how Bridges will accomplish William's 're-awakening') and the drag points of the pace are pretty heavy.Another issue are the characterizations themselves. When you mix two characters who are residing in the real world (Bridges and Ruehl), and two who are not (Williams and mousy Amanda Plummer), well, it's tough to see why Bridges and Ruehl would bother with them anyway. They lead a fairly normal existence, and in actuality would run for the hills from Williams' raving weirdo and Plummer's accident-prone spinster. The Plummer character especially, who is fallen in love with by Williams', despite the fact they've never spoken. And her two minutes of non-charm in the video store would make anyone feel they were wasting their time for Williams' cause.Ruehl won an Oscar for her efforts, for a part that was adequately played, but nothing spectacular.

Their originating scene came off forced anyhow (Bridges just lays there watching gasoline get poured on him). Plus the two kids were lousy actors.C.)

Three years pass whereupon he's been reduced to living above a video store where he also works and lives with his long-suffering girlfriend\/boss (Ruehl).In a drunken stumble through town, he happens upon Williams and his merry band of homeless knuckleheads. Bridges does the bug-eye thing during his initial stay in Williams' hideout, where ol' Robin does his usual rapid-fire insane act he had become so associated with. After discovering he has a connection to Williams' past, Bridges feels guilted into looking after the demented loon as best he can.The first 20 minutes of this ain't so bad, before it segues into the usual Gilliam flair for the bizarre. Wild camera angles and musical numbers permeate the storytelling, but writer LaGravenese saves that by adding a depth not commonly scene with this genre. There are factual statements about men, women, life, death, salvation, friendship, etc. Though too many moments are somewhat predictable (you just know how Bridges will accomplish William's 're-awakening') and the drag points of the pace are pretty heavy.Another issue are the characterizations themselves. When you mix two characters who are residing in the real world (Bridges and Ruehl), and two who are not (Williams and mousy Amanda Plummer), well, it's tough to see why Bridges and Ruehl would bother with them anyway. They lead a fairly normal existence, and in actuality would run for the hills from Williams' raving weirdo and Plummer's accident-prone spinster. The Plummer character especially, who is fallen in love with by Williams', despite the fact they've never spoken. And her two minutes of non-charm in the video store would make anyone feel they were wasting their time for Williams' cause.Ruehl won an Oscar for her efforts, for a part that was adequately played, but nothing spectacular. Michael Jeter, however, deserves special recognition solely for his show stopping song and dance number (how he hits those notes while still having testacles, I'll never know).I usually don't issue SPOILER WARNINGS in my reviews, but here I must address the flick's shortcomings (Here is your official ***SPOILER ALERT***!!!) A.) The fact that Parry is never made aware -- or doesn't acknowledge -- his connection to Jack loses a few points. Williams' character is so ethereal as it is, I was figuring Jack would confess to him only to have Williams' say he already knew who he was (Bridges states his full name on several occasions).B.) The two fire-setting yuppie kids was a ridiculous stretch even for a zaniness of this film's type. Their originating scene came off forced anyhow (Bridges just lays there watching gasoline get poured on him). Plus the two kids were lousy actors.C.) The fact that Jack doesn't exact revenge on said kids for their attack on Parry left me waiting and waiting for it. Yet, it never arrived.These may be petty complaints but it's what separated this movie from being great to only fair in my eyes.

It was his first film to be produced outside of Hollywood. It was the last film in which he had a starring role. It was his second to last completed film altogether. It is also by many regarded as his worst film, but while it is hard not to recognize that KING is uneven in places, I find it equally hard not to recognize its better qualities.By the time he embarked upon the screen-play, Chaplin had been seeking for a story for his next film since his exile out of the United States in 1952. For a while he considered getting his beloved Tramp character back in the limelight, but abandoned this idea as he was getting too old for doing the sort of physical playfulness that was required from the character. He finally landed on the story of King Shadhov, who has eloped to New York as a revolution has taken place in his country. Nearly broke, the king is forced into making money in ways which might disturb his royal image. He acquaints a super-intelligent, albeit precocious kid named Rupert (Michael Chaplin), whose parents are suspected of being communist sympathizers during the prime of the McCarthy-era. Chaplin ridicules several aspects of contemporary American culture, including predictable movies, commercials, rock'n'roll, how plastic surgery is increasingly being used out of a obsessive desire to prevent age to be recognized, and Television; one sequence probably stands even more relevant today, when King Shadhov is invited to a gathering in which he, unbeknownst to him, is being filmed through hidden cameras and shown directly on TV&#x85;this was ages before reality-TV, folks.What is usually criticized about the film is how Chaplin's personal bitterness over his exile is made too evident, and that he seems to be dealing with more problems than he can chew. In my eyes, these are not big problems; the satire may rarely be subtle, and it is obvious that the film is based on personal opinions of the creator, but such it had always been with Chaplin. Ever since the first films he made in which a conscious move to leave comment on the society can be traced, Chaplin's motive had not been as much to put the society to question as to let the society be the target of his comedy simply because he found lots of comic potential in it. I don't believe Chaplin would have made MODERN TIMES had he not seen the possibilities of making comedy out of the serious theme it covers. In the same way, he hardly made KING in a desire to let out his opinions, at least not solely so; rather, I believe that in search of new comedy material, he decided to use themes which had obsessed him much in the last few years, making the McCarthy-era and American culture obvious choices.Chaplin tries to chew a lot, but I think he succeeds most of the time, as his covering of nearly every theme in the film somehow relate to one another. More importantly, I think much of the comedy is breathtakingly funny; when King Shadhov arrives at the airport, exclaiming to his ambassador that We fooled them!, not realizing that a reporter has placed a microphone beneath his mouth, I laughed out loud, and it went louder pretty much throughout. One part which always makes me nearly roll on the floor in laughter is when Shadhov and his ambassador are having lunch right after Rupert has admitted to them that his parents have been members of the Communist party, making the two men so nervous they can't drink their coffee. It then knocks on the door, resulting in the ambassador getting his tongue paralyzed and being only able to shiver a series of C-c-c-c-c-c-c&#x85;'s until the person who knocked, a room service man, has left, whereupon the ambassador THEN exclaims totally exhausted, &#x85;Come in! The timing is perfect from both Chaplin and Oliver Johnston, who in fact overshadows Chaplin's performance a few times in the film.Yet, despite my conviction that A KING IN NEW YORK is a far cry better than its reputation claims, it suffers from inevitable short-comings. Some of the parts in which the comedy is not present are rather dull. I don't get what purpose the queen in the film fulfills, other than making way for an obvious conclusion to the story; the king and the queen has decided to divorce on the king's insistence, but they part on friendly terms. A scene follows in which the two of them chat about how the king once thought the queen was too young to know her best, but it turned out that she weren't, and so on, and the queen is then not granted a mention again until the very end, when it turns out she won't get a divorce after all; it's remarkable how these news fail to affect me each time I view the film. Also, here and there the dialogue feels rather superfluous. It has been pointed out that Chaplin here was working without his own studio and employees, for the first time in forty years, which possibly made him less open for criticism from others while making the film, or he may not even have been offered it. One should also note that Chaplin didn't remain blind to KING's lesser qualities; several years later, he wrote that he felt rather uneasy about the whole film. Chaplin went too far. A KING IN NEW YORK is by no means his best film, but it must rank among his funniest, and is quite thought-provoking every once in a while.

John Russell (Paul Newman) isn't necessarily a noble man. In an early scene, he watches indifferently as a decent soldier is threatened and bullied by an arrogant thug, Cicero Grimes (Richard Boone). Indeed, Russell is strikingly passive for the film's entire first half, receptive but indifferent to the plight of those around him. Russell was raised by a Native American tribe, and, having witnessed white society's racism first-hand, he has come to harbour prejudices of his own. 'Hombre (1967)' confronts the rottenness of the common man, and how the pervasion of sin can conceivably corrupt even the most steadfast of hearts into apathy (in this case, not only Russell, but also Cameron Mitchell's disillusioned Sheriff Braden &#x96; who's given a wonderful monologue on the hollowness of his career). Though director Martin Ritt surrounds the viewer with largely unpleasant characters, the film concludes with a blink of hope on the horizon, affirming that there are, indeed, certain human qualities worth fighting for.The character of John Russell was based on Jimmy Santiago McKinn, who was captured by the Apaches in 1885 and assimilated into the tribe. A real-life photograph of McKinn closes the film, the boy's face oddly alien and unsettling. Newman plays the role with masterful restraint; there's always something going on behind those blue eyes, though his face scarcely shows it. The character is not all that dissimilar to Clint Eastwood's The Man With No Name in Leone's Dollars trilogy &#x96; both characters, laconic and enigmatic, wander like ghosts through the affairs of other men, searching for something or someone worth fighting for (these similarities are probably deliberate; Russell often goes by the generic name of Hombre, which means man). Diane Celenti, as land-lady Jessie, characterises the smart, independent and sexually- aware heroine that also rose to prominence with the Revisionist Western, not unlike Claudia Cardinale in 'Once Upon a Time in the West (1968).' Richard Boone is deliciously wicked as a cocky, thuggish bandit, and ever-reliable performers like Fredric March and Martin Balsam round out an excellent, intimate cast of characters.

Whenever I start watching it, I initially have the same reaction that I do when reading the Twilight Series ( I know! Sacrilegious to even mention them in the same sentence right?). Bella by the end of the Twilight series, is in effect, just another reincarnation of Scarlett, a whiny brat who somehow makes it through all this adversity and ends up with a throng of male followers. I always wonder why anybody cared about Scarlett and didn't leave her to the Yankees in the first place.But while Bella remains boring, Gone With the Wind slips under your skin and drags you into the drama and web of selfishness. You aren't supposed to like Scarlett and her continuous melodramatic exclamations, she's not the heroine, but a train wreck. As she and Rhett spiral out of control, you can't help but start to care. It's an experience in itself to listen to the clever words drawl off of Clark Gable's lips.This is the one film that is synonymous with Hollywood. Set against a beautiful cinematic backdrop where every epic scene is laid out with precision and care, the film captures the lushness of the South that exists within the collective American imagination (these images most likely influenced by this film itself). Before watching the film for the first time, I recommend reading a bit about the production and influence it had at the time, facts that only make the film even more impressive.

Kevin Costner who stars and directs in the sweeping film 'Dances with Wolves' has delivered an epic of all proportions. It is a human drama, it is a classic Western, a civil war film and a film about understanding of Native Americans. Costner plays Lieutenant John Dunbar or as he will come to be known by the Native Americans - 'Dances with Wolves.' The story goes that Lt. John Dunbar, exiled to a remote western Civil War outpost, befriends wolves and Indians, making him an intolerable aberration in the military. The film is one of the first of it's kind to treat Native American's with respect, this is an intelligent film about breaking down the barriers of communications between a tribe of Native Americans and Dunbar. The story is brilliant and the acting is wonderful. The music score by John Barry is brilliant and his best alongside his score for 'Out of Africa' and I won't mention the Bond theme because no one really knows who really did it. The cinematography is brilliant and in my favorite scene from the film that is in perfect showcase. Late at night Dunbar is woken by the sound of buffalo. He can't see anything through the fog as he runs into the open field and as he stands there he is surrounded by a herd of buffalo who emerge from the mist and on the characters face emerges a look of wonder and amazement.

For one thing, it features in abundance something which Beneath totally lacks, namely the franchise's main man, Roddy McDowall! It also works better as a film in its own right than Beneath This time around, the only returning characters from either of the first two films are Cornelius, as played by McDowall, and Zira, as played by Kim Hunter for the third and final time. Having escaped Earth's destruction using Taylor's ship from the first film, the two married chimpanzees and their friend, Dr. Milo - played by Sal Mineo of Rebel Without a Cause fame in one of his final acting roles and his final film before he was murdered in 1976 - have been thrown backwards in time to present day Earth, specifically Los Angeles in 1973. After it is discovered that they can speak, they become a media sensation with Zira addressing women's groups, Cornelius opening a ride at Disneyland and so on. However, things take a darker turn when Zira reveals that she is pregnant.Interestingly, the plot of Escape is considerably closer to that of Pierre Boulle's 1963 novel La Planète des singes, on which the first film is based, than the first film itself. In the novel, French journalist Ulysee Mérou arrives in a technologically advanced ape society and, after several months being kept in a cage like the other brutish humans on the planet, likewise becomes a media sensation before it is discovered that he has fathered a child by Nova, the mute female human whom he, uh...befriends while in captivity. Incidentally, this was to have been incorporated into the first film but Fox was reportedly worried that it might qualify as sodomy.Having both read the novel and listened to a BBC audio adaptation of it read by Michael Maloney, I have to say that I found the plot and the characterisation in the first film more interesting and compelling. By way of comparison, Escape is not as good as the first film but it was more enjoyable and engaging than the fairly similar novel, which is largely down to its witty and intelligent script by Paul Dehn, its light satire of celebrities and the media, a strong villain in Eric Braeden's Dr. Otto Hasslein (essentially the human equivalent of Dr. Zaius), an excellent supporting cast which includes Braeden, Ricardo Montalban, William Windom and Bradford Dillman and, above all, great turns from Roddy McDowall and Kim Hunter.

In fact, the last hour or so of the film is good enough to almost warrant a recommendation, but the first 30 minutes are too rough for me to do so with a good conscience, and the middle hour simply isn't engaging enough.The film tells the story of two sisters, Hilary and Jacqueline DuPre. Hilary is a flautist, while Jackie is a cellist. The film chronicles their lives as children, where they were torn between being best friends and competing with each other, and their adult lives where jealousy and alienation both tore their relationship apart and also made it stronger.The problem with the film is not the actors, but the director. Hilary and Jackie is a very multi-layered drama, but director Anand Tucker has a hard time keeping it all straight. The result is a film that wants to tell a story, but lacks the focus to tell it in an effective manner. The result is a poorly-focused film that struggles to get its point across.The acting, however, is magnificent. Emily Watson is terrific as Jackie. She has a love\/hate relationship with her cello-playing. One one hand, playing the cello is something that she's good at, but on the other hand, it alienates her from what she wants in life. Although Watson has the more showy part, Griffiths is by no means a lesser performer here. Griffiths is torn between helping her sister, and living the life she wants with her husband and family. Based on his reputation and his stiff performance in The Water Horse (ironically also starring Emily Watson), I didn't think that David Morrissey had the capacity to act. Fortunately, I was wrong. Morrrissey gives an energetic performance as Hilary's husband Kiffer. He loves his wife, but sometimes that comes at a price. Likewise, James Frains is a far cry from his performance as the villain in Into the Blue. He's also a musician, and his relationship with Jackie is an example of who romances between artists can be very difficult.There's some good stuff here; the music is beautiful, and the scenes where Jackie plays are effectively executed. But it's just put together quite well enough to warrant more than a see it if you must verdict. ","genre":null},{"date":"20 December 2009","score":"","review":" Hilary and Jackie gets off to a weak start, but by the end of the film it has become quite engaging. In fact, the last hour or so of the film is good enough to almost warrant a recommendation, but the first 30 minutes are too rough for me to do so with a good conscience, and the middle hour simply isn't engaging enough.The film tells the story of two sisters, Hilary and Jacqueline DuPre. Hilary is a flautist, while Jackie is a cellist. The film chronicles their lives as children, where they were torn between being best friends and competing with each other, and their adult lives where jealousy and alienation both tore their relationship apart and also made it stronger.The problem with the film is not the actors, but the director. Hilary and Jackie is a very multi-layered drama, but director Anand Tucker has a hard time keeping it all straight. The result is a film that wants to tell a story, but lacks the focus to tell it in an effective manner. The result is a poorly-focused film that struggles to get its point across.The acting, however, is magnificent. Emily Watson is terrific as Jackie.
