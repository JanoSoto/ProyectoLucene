I was a huge fan of this animated series as a child and I think this movie is definitely pleasing for fans of the show, Tommy coping with a new sibling is a major plot point and it suited to make something as serious as that a ninety minute movie instead of a fifteen minute story, the usual innuendos are evident throughout as well which is always fun for the grown ups. My only major problem with this film is that it is way too loud, it moves around constantly and never really takes time to simply ease down and develop its characters with dialogue, I understand the film is constantly moving as it is aimed at kids, but even children can enjoy a quite moment every now and again. The voice cast is of course fantastic, all the regulars from the series returning to voice their now iconic roles, it also contains some adorable musical numbers that may not be Disney standards but are still plenty of fun. Though it can be a bit obnoxious at times, The Rugrats Movie is still a sweet and fun movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good family film. After the birth of his baby brother Dil, Tommy and his three best friends head on a trip to the hospital to return the troublesome child, but get lost in the woods along the way.

And even Disney films of the time are no exception. Their art style is muted, using heavy shadows, stark contrasts and swaying away from the cartoony colours. Their story lines are rather adult and depressing. Well, in comparison at least. And the crowning achievement of this is none other than The Black Cauldron, the most peculiar of the Disney canon films.At the time Disney Animation Studios were not doing so well. In fact the company was seriously considering closing them down and focusing solely on theme parks and merchandise. This movie was originally meant to change that course, but it almost ended up being the sole thing to ruin the whole studio. It wanted to take Disney to a whole different direction, picking as its source material a dark fantasy novel and staying very faithful to its tone, earning the PG rating.And yes, before you ask, the pig is in the book as well. Disney didn't add that to give the movie a mascot. Gurgi is in the book as well. I'm never reading that book, no matter how much you'd pay me.So what went wrong? Well, what didn't. The Black Cauldron is a mess. It was a major flop upon its release, and I can definitely see why. It has since garnered a cult following, but the fact still remains that it simply isn't a Disney film. Families went in expecting a typical Disney experience with fairytale stories, kid friendly messages and all around merriment. Instead they were treated to a medieval fantasy story leaning heavily towards dark and horror.But, that could be forgiven. I actually somewhat like the idea in principle. Great heroics, one scary villain, myths and legends, sword and sorcery, all done by one of the greatest animation studios on Earth. What's not to like? How about the fact that the main character is an unlikable, lazy jerk, the side characters have no, you know, character, the plot wanders around worse than a drunken minstrel, the end twist is unimaginably disappointing, the MacGuffin pig is ludicrous, the villain while certainly scary has no charisma or presence beyond looking like the devil and as a whole I'm simply not feeling the epicness. It's clear Disney had never done anything like this, and had no idea how to adapt to a different kind of storytelling tone. A dark fantasy story differs greatly from fairy tales, though they both certainly utilize the same character tropes and source materials. But whereas fairy tales are about morals and simple lessons about good and evil, dark fantasy is more about the struggle against eternal darkness, the meaning of hope in the midst of despair and about guts and glory. I don't get that from The Black Cauldron.The movie has its upsides, definitely. It looks great, the villain is certainly the scariest Disney has ever done and about one third of the story is actually pretty captivating. But it has flaws, many many flaws. Not my personal favourite, but you should still check it out to see if it speaks to you.

At the time Disney was having financial troubles. Although Fantasia (1940) and Pinocchio (1940) were critically acclaimed, both failed to bring in a profit for the animation giant. Interestingly enough the screening of Dumbo (1941) did the exact opposite and even managed to be made during an animators' strike during the current time. Like a lot of the other Disney films, the iconic elephant would become apart of the library of assorted characters to represent the Disney company. The only thing that sets Dumbo apart from other Disney mascots is just how many people and fans remember him more than others. He probably comes 2nd or 3rd to Mickey. For this to stick that much there must have been something in the film to make it hang around so long in the conscious of the viewers.That something is what goes into this story's writing penned by Joe Grant and Dick Huemer. The story is about a newborn elephant with ears larger than normal being brought into the world by mother elephant Mrs. Jumbo. Yet with his ears being abnormally big, the name Dumbo ends up being his new name by the local snot nosed gossip circus elephants. Upon one show, locals begin to make fun of Dumbo, which enrages mom causing her to be separated from him. Feeling sad and alone, Dumbo befriends Timothy Q. Mouse (Edward Brophy) who sympathizes and wants to help him. There are two main components that work in the script. The first is the mother\/son relationship between Dumbo and his mother. The other part is the life lesson of never stop believing in oneself and to never let others bring you down. Dumbo in some ways parallels that to an early version of WALL·E (2008); where the main character does not have much or if any dialog. This kind of writing isn't always effective because it's harder to portray emotions on a verbal level but that's not a problem here.Dumbo is one the sweetest little characters a viewer could watch. There is literally nothing to dislike about him. He's possibly even more innocent than Bambi (1942). Watching him interact with his mother is one of the sweetest moments in childhood history. It is this element that demonstrates how important a mother is in a child's life. As for Timothy Q. Mouse, he represents the self-preservation part about moving forward in life and not letting anyone stop you. If it were not for Timothy, who knows how long it would've taken Dumbo to get out of his slump of being mocked. Timothy is actually an underrated mouse icon and should be the second mouse to think of other than Mickey. However, even with these strong points there are some moments of question as to why they were even considered to be included. For these scenes, they involve the pink elephant sequence and racial representation.During a moment when Dumbo has the hiccups he accidentally takes a drink out of bucket that contains booze and gets loopy, which then induces him and the audience into a trippy sequence about pink elephants. From a particular viewpoint the scene does make sense, which is distracting us so we're thrown off guard when the scene ends, but from another point of view there really is no other significance. It's just a scene that gets a bit weird over time and may give some kids nightmares. As for racial representation Dumbo and Timothy meet a group of crows that are drawn and talk like African Americans at the time (as media had thought). For both situations it's understood that more adults viewed cartoons at the time and the way African Americans were portrayed in cartoons was much different, but both don't excuse for how that turns out now. Yes, it is all apart of history but it is still insensitive. Children nowadays watch this and could get the wrong idea. If these parts were managed in a less insulting way there'd be more to give slack on.For this movie there was no head of production. There were seven different directors for this feature; all of which handled different sequences. Nonetheless they all are directed as if it were one person. The animation headed by Art Babbitt was well crafted too. All the movement on each character and objects were fluid and smooth. For a Disney film like this, nothing but excellence is expected, otherwise it would not be considered among the memorable films. The music composed by Oliver Wallace and Frank Churchill was an addition to happily hear. There are several tracks that are recognizable and are catchy to listen to. The main theme for Dumbo is heroic and brave sounding with that classic mid 1900s sound of horn and string. Other tracks like the odd Pink Elephants and jumpy Casey Jr. train tune are catchy and memorable too. It's not perfect but it is still an enjoyable piece of film work.Unfortunately due to the time of its release, the film suffers from racial caricatures and adult content involving booze. It's not a huge anchor but it does feel insensitive. Thankfully the adorable main characters, effective writing, creative animation and memorable music help even things out.

It's actually very good for about the first half or more. But then the story loses momentum and direction. The promise of the beginning part dissipates. Only in the climax does the story regain some kind of footing. The reason for this is that the story shifts away from the supernatural and toward the mental state of the obsessed Richard Gere, its protagonist. I think it has to do this. It also diverts into some sub-plots that really do not tie in that well with the main plot or augment it. These include the fate of the character played by Will Patton (and played well) and a man who wrote a book on similar phenomena and warns Gere off. Still, I liked the movie.This is a horror movie, having the classical central element of a horror movie which is the presence of the unexplained supernatural. There is a lot of that in this story and none of it is explained, as it cannot be explained in terms of the natural. One has to accept that limitation on stories like this. There is really not that much of an attempt to understand even the basic physical impossibility of Gere ending up where he has at the story's outset. If that's possible, then so are many other things.Instead, and rightly so, the story focuses on the more interesting questions of why Gere has been chosen, what he's expected to do, what he can or cannot accomplish, and what sorts of interactions he should seek and have with the supernatural spirit that has affected both him and other residents of the town of Point Pleasant. This is the heart of the story, and it makes for an engaging movie.This movie is also a beautifully-photographed neo-noir. It seems that neo-noir is a natural for telling some horror and sci-fi movies as well as the usual mysteries and crime stories.The movie expresses some decent philosophy within its context of supernatural fiction. I do not take this story as being true or even a facsimile of the events upon which it is based. Not at all. I take this as fiction inspired by whatever happened. Anyway, the philosophy is that the supernatural with respect to the dead has its realm and the natural has its realm, and it's best to keep them apart. Trying to step over the line can lead to madness. This is all expressed by Kate Winslet's character.

They each fit a common stereotype The Loser (Elijah Wood), The Outcast (Clea DuVall), The Stoner (Josh Hartnett), The Jock (Shawn Hatosy), The Cheerleader (Jordana Brewster), etc.As could be expected with a Robert Rodriguez venture, there was clearly some fun had with the casting choices. How would YOU like to have Santanico Pandemonium (a.k.a. Salma Hayek) as your nurse, The T-1000 (a.k.a. Robert Patrick) as your coach, Lillith Sternin Crane (a.k.a. Bebe Neuwirth) as your principal, and Margaret White (a.k.a. Piper Laurie) as one of the teachers?The script is by Scream creator Kevin Williamson, based on a story by David Wechter and Bruce Kimmel, and that can be either a selling point or a turnoff for the prospective viewer. Not surprisingly, the script gets annoyingly self-referential, with sci-fi stories like The Puppet Masters and Invasion of the Body Snatchers getting a shout out. Rodriguez is a John Carpenter fan, and that's evident in the way that The Faculty plays out, as it hits a number of the same beats as Carpenters' The Thing - including a pivotal testing sequence and a severed head gag. This is all just a little too self-consciously hip for its own good, right down to the soundtrack.The effects are a combination of some practical work and a fair amount of CGI, a lot of it rather ropey. Still, the monster design is pretty fun.The attractive young cast inhabit their roles reasonably well, and are supported by a superb bunch of veterans - also among them are Christopher McDonald are Woods' father, and Daniel von Bargen. Jon Stewart plays the science teacher!

The 39 Steps has all the hallmarks of a classic Hitchcock escapade with the addition of some of the most innovative cinematography ever. The smooth panning, cut-away shots, and smart camera angles are techniques which are revered even today; Hitchcock made the most of the sterile B&W format by prioritising cinematography to create a tense, gripping story. The main flaw with this adaptation is its divergence from the book - several significant points, such as the nature of the 39 steps and the inclusion of a female lead (Madeleine Carroll), were altered to make the film more exciting. If - like me - you haven't read the book, however, this isn't an impediment to the story at all. Surprisingly for an early film, the pace of the narrative is exactly right, never once moving too quickly (as many short 30s films have a tendency to do). Comic elements are blended seamlessly with tense sequences, emphasising Hanney's peril rather than undermining it. A strong sense of realism pervades the action, making the story even more beguiling. All the acting performances are sublime, but the real star of the film is the Scottish Highland backdrop, bleak and beautiful even in black and white. A sparse yet emotive score builds tension at key points; the dialogue is as sharp as in any Hitchcock thriller. The ultimate test of a classic film is if it can still be as entertaining as it was on its day of release, and The 39 Steps fulfils that category perfectly. It remains an excellent, amusing thriller which twists and turns right to the end, and will hopefully continue to delight audiences throughout the ages.

It's a very odd mixture of the audience-pleasing easy comedy and something more sinister - possibly due to both lead's past public lives. so as they meet Williams friends and family they cant believe who he brought to a family party so she is ordinary like everybody the romantic music soundtrack is very good to deal with offset of their story as it goes has a lot to say about fame and the effects of it on a life. It never bothers to take a stand or really explain if Roberts's character embraces her super stardom or is oppressed by it. Screenwriter Curtis makes compelling arguments for both sides of the debate but strays away from truly looking deep within their souls When you think about it, William was a fan of Anna but was worried that the fame thing would have an effect on him Notting Hill is an extremely charming film with so much love to offer. 7\/10 and its perfect date night film .

It rubs the lotion on its skin. It does that whenever it is told, in such a booming, baritone voice, only makes it sound even more intimidating. He is one of the creepiest killers in film, vaguely similar to Leatherface, and leaves quite an impression, despite precious little screen time. I found him to be more intimidating and terrifying even than Lector, who, while also chilling, was more of a gentleman in his speech and mannerisms. Even when Lector was beating the guard with his nightstick, he did it with such elegance and finesse, he made it seem almost poetic. A counter to Buffalo Bill's crudity.The climax was taut and suspenseful, as Starling gropes around in the pitch black basement searching for Buffalo Bill, a light, and a way out, but it was negated when he committed such an obvious, stupid mistake (loudly pulling the hammer back on his gun, and basically announcing his presence to Starling) Or, was that the purpose of that action, to show us he really wasn't a very smart man?
