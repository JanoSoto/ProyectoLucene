[{"date":"12 October 2005","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" First off I would just like to say THE FACULTY is just pure fun! Every time I see this movie, it just gets better & better! The film is just pure fun from beginning to end, heck even the back ground scenes which normally wouldn't be of interest in any other film, actually manages to being just as entertaining as what is going on between the main characters! Admittedly the film really is just a direct to video B movie plot, given a theatrical treatment. In fact, the film is very similar to the less satisfying teen thriller DISTURBING BEHAVIOR, with a group of teens combating a deadly take over at their high school. Heck there's even a similar scene where the nerd has the porno magazines, which are stashed under his mattress, taken by his parents who thinks he is losing his mind once he confronts them with his theory that the staff & students at his school are turning into aliens. THE FACULTY has been best described as being THE BREAKFAST CLUB meets INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS & I feel that description is pretty much accurate, we have Dan the football jock, the new kid in Mary Beth, the southern pretty girl next door, Delilah the stuck up school cheerleader, Skeet the drug dealer, Casey the nerd, the school outcast Stokley, while this might have come off as being stale in terms of the characterizations, the fact is the characters in many ways while embracing these stereotypes, actually making them work far beyond that. The script by KEVIN WILLIAMSON is really smart, hip, edgy, funny, sexy & scary & boasts his usual trademarks, most notably in the characters referencing other films in the genre (which I will get into) having a character named Casey & even acknowledges some character names from his previous films, Mr. Tate the high school history teacher is a knowing nod to Kari Tate, the name Jamie Lee Curtis character went under in HALLOWEEN H20. The direction is really good here, while ROBERT RODRIGUEZ usual hype & stylish directorial flourishes are somewhat limited here, he manages to keep the film going at a fairly decent pace & makes sure there is always something going on behind camera to keep the audiences attention. He also manages to build suspense, tension & atmosphere beautifully, as well as delivering several gross out creepy scenes. The acting is strong here, with each actor managing to make the character they are playing all the more interesting. The score by MARCO BELTRAMI is pretty decent, however it sounds just to much like SCREAM.The film acknowledges many others, one of the kids is reading ORPHANS IN THE SKY & the film makes mention of the films INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS by Jack Finney & the lesser known THE PUPPET MASTERS by Robert A. Heinlein (from which one character cleverly mentions how Invasion actually swiped the plot from Heinlein's novel) however noticeably it forgets to mention INVADERS FROM MARS & NOT OF THIS EARTH, both films of which bared similar plots to Invasion & Puppet Masters. Another film that is paid loving tribute to is THE THING (1982), in fact there are two scenes that were pulled from that film & inserted into this films plot, the first being the sequence towards the end of the movie, wherein the small group who are aware of the invasion, force each other to snort a home made drug in order to prove they are not aliens, after they learn that this particular drug will kill the aliens, which pays tribute to the scene when Kurt Russell forced his team to take a blood test to detect amongst them who is an alien & who is not & the second which sees one of the faculty members teachers lose her head after a failed attack on a student, only to have her head sprout tentacles & move across the ground. The special effects are really good, with a mix of practical & CGI effects, check out the queen alien in monster form! The gore is good, which includes a pencil in the hand & a vicious stabbing with a pair of scissors, a needle to the eye, a gun shot to the head, & a badly decomposing teachers scalp is torn from her skull, plus lots of alien guck is shot around. Best of all, the film has some really clever plot twists & turns which abound throughout the film & one really cares for the characters & their fates, which is not something one can say about most genre films. ROBERT PATRICK is especially fun as the hard headed high school gym coach who winds up being taken over by the tentacled beastie & JOSH HARTNETT really shines in his role of the local drug dealer who sells everything from videos of Neve Campbell (SCREAM) & Jennifer Love Hewitt (I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER) in the nude, from drugs, fake ID's & even flavoured condoms! All in all, while the film did nowhere near the business that SCREAM did & while the film is pretty much been forgotten about amongst horror fans, lost in the endless batch of 1990's teen horror films, I feel that THE FACULTY deserves so much better than what it has gotten, the film is in my humble opinion one of the top ten best horror films ever released in the 90's.

The unique way that John Carpenter has directed this picture, opening the door to so many mock-genres, it will chill you to the bone whether it is your first time watching it or your fiftieth. The sound, the menacing horror of Michael Meyers and the infamous scream of Jamie Lee Curtis gives this film instant cult status and a great start for the independent era. I love the music, I love the characters, the familiar yet spooky setting, the simplistic nature of the villain, and the random chaos of it all. There is no really rhyme or reason to the killing in this first film, giving us a taste of Michael's true nature. Is he insane, or in some way just a very brilliant beast? That question may never be truly answered, but Carpenter gives us his 100% and more devotion to this amazing masterpiece.John Carpenter is the master of horror. While lately his films have not been the caliber that they once were (see Ghosts of Mars), Halloween began his powerhouse of a career. This is his ultimate film. While he did release other greats, I will always remember this one as the film that caused me to turn on all the lights, beware when babysitting, and check behind closed doors, because you never knew where the evil would appear next. Carpenter has this amazing ability to bring you into the world in which he weaves. With the power of his camera, he places these images of Meyers in places you least expected while giving you the perception as if the murderer is right next to you. I loved every scene in which we panned back and there was Michael, watching from the distance, without anyone the wiser. That was scary, yet utterly brilliant. I loved the scenes in which Carpenter pulled your fright from nearly thin air. There you would be, minding your own business, when suddenly that horrid mask would appear out of nowhere. Like the characters, you too thought it was just a trick of the eye, but that is where Carpenter gets you, it isn't. Michael isn't a ghost, he is a human being (or at least we think), yet he has a stronger mental ability than most of the main characters. This leads into some really dark themes and unexplored symbolism, but even without that, this is a spooky film.Then, if you just didn't have enough of Michael just vaporizing in the windows of your house, Carpenter adds that chilling theme music. I still have that tapping of the piano keys in my mind, constantly wondering if Meyers is looking at me through the window. Carpenter has found the perfect combination of visual frights and chilling sounds to foreshadow what may happen to our unsuspecting victims next. It is lethal, and it is done with refreshing originality and more unique thrills than anything released by today's Horror Hollywood could muster. Carpenter's Halloween is a breath of fresh air in the midst of what could be a rough horror year, with actual scares being replaced by Paris Hilton, you know that the quality isn't quite the same.Finally, I would like to say that even the simplistic nature of the opening murder in this film is terrifying and chilling. The use of the clown mask sent shivers up my spine. The way that it was filmed with that elongated one shot using the child's mask as if it were our own eyes is still one of the best horror openings ever! It completely sets the tone for the remainder of that film. You have the babysitter theme, you have the childish behavior which carries with Michael throughout the film, and you have the art talent of Carpenter all rolled into one. I could literally speak for hours upon hours about this film, but instead I would rather go watch it again. It is worth the repeat visit many times! Overall, I think this is one of the most outstanding films in cinematic history. Skip all those foreign films that think that they are going to chance the face of movies leave it to a budget tight Carpenter and the slasher film genre. This singular movie redefined a whole generation of horror films, and still continues to be an influence on modern-day horror treats. The lethal combination of a genuinely spooky murderer, the powerful cinematography of the events (which normally doesn't amount to much in horror films), and the beauty of Jamie Lee Curtis is exactly what makes Halloween that film above the rest. Sure, Freddy is cool and you feel sympathetic for Jason, but Michael is real, he is troubled, and he is on the loose lusting for the blood of babysitters. What can be better?

It's a story which happens in St. Louis in the year leading up to the World Fair held there sometime in the past. The exact year is irrelevant, and I cannot be bothered to look it up. It follows the story of a family embarking on all sorts of every-day adventures, such as the little girl's first Hallow's Eve, the slightly elder girl's problems with having a little sister, the two oldest sisters' problems with young men, and ketchup-making. Also the father's dilemma of being successful and getting a job in New York, thus disrupting the happy family's small-city life, or continuing to be only successful in St. Louis. Not much is to be said about the plot besides that. This movie has Judy Garland. And singing. And dancing. Of course. It's stupid. It's clever. It's silly. It's fun. Yes, there is a boy-meets-girl plot here. Yes, there is a girl-almost-misses-out-on-boy plot. And it's perfectly okay. Because it's fun. And that is the essence of a musical. To be fun. That doesn't mean it's only fun, and nothing more to be said about it. It does involve some technical innovations, like the crane dolly (I think that's what it's called), a clever little thing that allowed the camera to move and rotate in any direction. It's not exactly Bullet-Time, but still quite clever, especially for filming choreographed dance sequences. Like so many films from this era, it is greatly superior to many films of today (with the exception of Tarantino and a few other masters of film conversation) in terms of conversation. It's wit is a delight at times, and some scenes are what they are simply because of the sense of ingenious dialogue. The singing and dancing is seamlessly constructed and choreographed. They're diegetic (serve the advancement of the film's plot, instead of simply being a gratuitous musical scene, like in most musical in the late 1920's and early 1930's). And now for the shortcomings. It is a bit corny at times, but I'm not sure if it's because it's truly corny or if I've just seen it in so many films made *after* this film was made. I really like Judy Garland, unlike many of my colleagues. In this film, though, I did get a slight feeling of frustration with her, but not for too long though. It might be that I felt this way about her character because *she* felt this way about her character, which she apparently did. It's completely and utterly predictable, with only a couple of exceptions, which don't exactly have anything to do with the main plot, but more like subplots or deviations from the story. But that's okay, because this is a musical. In all, Meet Me In St. Louis is a fine film, I'll rate it at around 4 out of 5.Useless ps. A song in this film is called Skip To My Lou. That is also the nickname of an NBA player, Rafer Alston, who now plays for the Houston Rockets.

It's a story which happens in St. Louis in the year leading up to the World Fair held there sometime in the past. The exact year is irrelevant, and I cannot be bothered to look it up. It follows the story of a family embarking on all sorts of every-day adventures, such as the little girl's first Hallow's Eve, the slightly elder girl's problems with having a little sister, the two oldest sisters' problems with young men, and ketchup-making. Also the father's dilemma of being successful and getting a job in New York, thus disrupting the happy family's small-city life, or continuing to be only successful in St. Louis. Not much is to be said about the plot besides that. This movie has Judy Garland. And singing. And dancing. Of course. It's stupid. It's clever. It's silly. It's fun. Yes, there is a boy-meets-girl plot here. Yes, there is a girl-almost-misses-out-on-boy plot. And it's perfectly okay. Because it's fun. And that is the essence of a musical. To be fun. That doesn't mean it's only fun, and nothing more to be said about it. It does involve some technical innovations, like the crane dolly (I think that's what it's called), a clever little thing that allowed the camera to move and rotate in any direction. It's not exactly Bullet-Time, but still quite clever, especially for filming choreographed dance sequences. Like so many films from this era, it is greatly superior to many films of today (with the exception of Tarantino and a few other masters of film conversation) in terms of conversation. It's wit is a delight at times, and some scenes are what they are simply because of the sense of ingenious dialogue. The singing and dancing is seamlessly constructed and choreographed. They're diegetic (serve the advancement of the film's plot, instead of simply being a gratuitous musical scene, like in most musical in the late 1920's and early 1930's). And now for the shortcomings. It is a bit corny at times, but I'm not sure if it's because it's truly corny or if I've just seen it in so many films made *after* this film was made. I really like Judy Garland, unlike many of my colleagues. In this film, though, I did get a slight feeling of frustration with her, but not for too long though. It might be that I felt this way about her character because *she* felt this way about her character, which she apparently did. It's completely and utterly predictable, with only a couple of exceptions, which don't exactly have anything to do with the main plot, but more like subplots or deviations from the story. But that's okay, because this is a musical. In all, Meet Me In St. Louis is a fine film, I'll rate it at around 4 out of 5.Useless ps. A song in this film is called Skip To My Lou. That is also the nickname of an NBA player, Rafer Alston, who now plays for the Houston Rockets.

However, it is so bad, that anyone with even a little taste in cinema will start howling with laughter. The director clearly used as few words as possible to direct this film, and the acting is truly awful, making this film unintentionally funny. Ted Wass actually does act in the first scene and in the last, both shot on the same airplane, leading me to suspect that those were filmed before he met his co-star, the truly inept Tanya Roberts. After meeting her, it is apparent that Wass realized just how bad an actress she was, and gave up trying, producing a monotone performance for the rest of the film. Tanya Roberts may have been good looking but her acting range is limited to one expression where she screws her face up in an effort to look like she is concentrating (I thought she might just have been constipated throughout the filming since that is what her one facial expression suggested to me). The best actress in this whole mess, Elizabeth of Toro is killed off only a quarter of the way through the film, which brings the level of acting way down. The production clearly was filmed on a shoestring budget where they couldn't afford to re-shoot anything. Even the casual viewer in the theater is able to spot the wire the model helicopter is being guided by when it crashes (your not supposed to be able to see that), and there is never any kind of a herd of animals on screen in this African jungle movie, just one of any type at a time. If you watch carefully you will see the occasional shadow on the ground which doesn't belong to any actor in the scene(it must be a crew member's). The plot is blindingly obvious with absolutely no surprises or dramatic tension. The script is also very poor, with cheesy dialog running throughout it, and you can predict lines and jokes far in advance of their being said. Actually, the limited script helps as it means you don't have to suffer through Roberts trying to speak. So go to the film and laugh at it, and learn what not to do when producing a movie.

Here was a film which opened with a dedication to fallen SFPD officers. But the fashions haven't changed that much. Hairstyles are about the same (this wasn't a completely 70s-looking film). And the cynical, edgy behavior was very 90s, and even current, today.How does the film hold up? Well, the courts don't work. The criminals are preferred over the victims. Pets are protected, people aren't. One arm of the law seems at war with the other. One statue vitiates another. The 'system' only attacks the law-abiding. Etc. And Justice demands penalty for Scorpio's crimes. So Harry is justified at Kezar, something like that. He clearly is justified at the end, because Scorpio goes for the gun. It's literally self-defense. The angry wordplay, literally the taunting, could be excused as an effort to get 'the edge'. It does seem recklessly inviting nonetheless, making Harry the killer at that moment, and the psychotic killer his victim.There are inconsistencies. Earlier, when the tooth is revealed, Harry is sure the girl is dead. When Harry is on the phone, with only Chico listening in by wireless, he asks - is the girl alive? How could it be both? So Harry is sure she's dead. But then as 'bagman', he runs all over town to catch the psycho. He shoots him and tortures him in the stadium, because he wants to know if he can rescue her - before she dies? The stadium scene is really the key scene of the film. It's startling when DeGeorgio hits the stadium lights at just the right time. It ends in the helicopter shot, as that used in Easy Rider, for example (the final scene pull back, and stop, which terminates this and other Harry films). And it's a good explanation of San Francisco; 'rolled up' city streets, cold low fog, wet stadium (Kezar stadium was since rebuilt, lowered, and named after HOF 'niner Bob Sinclair).As others have pointed out, Eastwood had to apologize for Dirty Harry, at least in the subsequent two films. That's what really crippled those two sequels. They were Dirty Harry lite, even anti-Harry, that were afraid of Dirty Harry. The fourth film returned a bit to the original. And he does let himself, or rather his mirror image in Sondra Locke's character, off the hook as an angel of justice in her own right.This film is a hit because of the odd combination of the minimalist score, Siegel, Eastwood of course, but also Robinson who makes the film for his insanely perverted killer, who like Malkovich's killer in a later Eastwood film, and unlike aux. Rat-Packer Silva in a 'Eastwood-type' film from Burt Reynolds, doesn't even need to 'shoot up' to kill. He just shoots and doesn't blink, completely sober. And he seems driven to commit murder and mayhem at any opportunity. In that, he approaches the nightmarish demons of later slasher films in the 70s. And it rings true for his whimpering when it suits him, just like any real bully or hardened thug.As for Harry, again, hero or killer? He is the very model of competence without any wasted motion. Or is he just an egotist, a Bill Clinton before anyone really knew? How did you know he was a rapist - asks the mayor? Over his shoulder Harry explains - trust ME to do the job. Don't ask questions. You do your job. I'll do mine. Oh wait, that was Steve McQueen in Bullitt, dressing down Robert Vaughn's untrustworthy martinet. So yes, his role is similar to that of John Wayne, in that 'Wayne's characters would often make their own law, out of frustration or convenience, or to achieve advantage. But even as a loner, The Duke had a 'posse'. There were people in town who called him friend. Dirty Harry is the man-with-no-name, a past but no family, etc. You don't know about the guy. There is no 'posse'. There are no drinking buddies.And what else about Harry? He confronts Popwell, shotgun on the ground nearby, with the famous bluff. Harry's gun is empty. Of course, Popwell's character is injured, so Harry could just have stepped on his arm if he'd gone for it. But he taunts. He knows his bullet count, and he taunts. Harry enjoys the 'reluctant hero', a bit too much. The 'dirty job' - is fun. Dirty Harry breaks the law to satisfy justice; or at least that's his plan. But as Urich asks in one of the 'extras' - can we have cops like this? And his obvious answer is, not really. What you don't see in this film, or subsequent films, is the dangerous side of Harry; when the bet goes bad. You only have hints. On the exit to 'Q' (and, of course, Scorpio doesn't live long enough to even get to prison), he hops the bus, potentially putting the kids and driver in further danger.

The characters are unforgettable, with a wonderful musical score that sticks in the head. Jen, the main character, finds that he is ordained to fulfill a prophecy finally revealed to him by his master, the wisest of the Mystics. A single crystal shard was lost long ago, and must be recovered before the three suns align in the sky. But Jen must first find the shard, and then figure out what to do with it once he has it, all the while trying to stay one step ahead of the cruel Skeksis. And time is running out. The thing that I think makes this movie so memorable is the fact that it is so unlike other fantasy films. It exists in a world all its own, with new creatures and characters you don't find in other films. If looking for a companion to the film, I recommend the book of the same name. It goes into more detail about the world of Thra, and I feel it greatly enhances the immersion into the film.

He is a weatherman who is to Ground Hog Day as Ebenezer Scrooge is to Christmas. Fate gets fed up with his attitude and forces him to relive that day until he gets it right.Second, it's deep. He doesn't get it right the first time, or perhaps for years. He does what any human would do in the situation. Early on, he uses his knowledge of that day to play God. Then, he uses it to have fun and get women. Then, he is filled with despair and tries to end it with his own death. Then, after trying every crass and immature thing he can think of, he finally realizes that he can actually enjoy his fate if he is reliving a great day, so he makes it so. He makes himself a better person, but the transformation happens only after many missteps ... exactly what would happen to anybody really caught in the situation.How many comedies do you know in which the lead character quotes Chekhov and recites French poetry?

I remember the first time i saw this movie when i was in my mid-teens. I had just started my own personal gambling journey, attending my local dog track. There was something very special about this movie and i knew it would have a profound effect on my life. From the beginning, The Gambler is a very dark movie. The opening scenes are of James Caan leaving a casino in the early hours of the morning after losing heavily at the tables. He drives his car recalling his losses and curses to himself. The movie soundtrack plays Gustav Mahler's 1st Symphony (this piece sets the whole tone for the movie in my opinion). Mahler is great for tragedy (remember Death in Venice). Caan's character, Axel Freed, then wipes himself out completely, losing his last 20 bucks to some guys playing basketball for small change. This is the first indication as to Axel's self-destructiveness, that he is always looking for a 'result', be it good or bad. We learn that Axel is a an educated man, very educated. He teaches English as a University Professor. In his gambling though he chooses to play the fool, perhaps purposely. He avoids the 'locks' and sure things and instead courts uncertainty in his never ending craving for thrills and experience. Unless his bet is good for 'action', then it is no good at all. Unfortunately for Axel and everyone he loves (mother, girlfriend, grandfather) this cavalier style of play leads to nothing but financial misery and breakdown of valued relationships (particularly that with his mother, which is also key to the whole film). He is a martingale player in the true sense (double or nothing). One day everything seems to go right and he reaches a plateau when doubling on 18 and drawing a 3! He wins enough to break free from his shylocks, but is still not satisfied and he risks all his profits from his good day on a game of basketball. The scene when he loses this bet in the last second of the game listening to the commentary in the bath is incredibly real to anyone who has gambled for 'proper' money and lost will testify. That feeling of being absolutely sick to your stomach, not to mention the feelings of isolation, guilt and plain stupidity. The film could of ended there in a way, but it goes to another level. To finally free himself of the money lenders (local mob), Axel agrees to fix a college basketball game where he teaches by bribing one of his English students who is the star player on the team. In a close game Axel's student comes through and his debts are cleared. As at the start of the film though, Axel is still looking for a result. The only gamble left to him, is that of his own life. He walks into a bar and picks up a prostitute in the Harlem district of New York. Then he purposely does not pay her which provokes her pimp (Antonio Fargas a.k.a Huggy Bear) into drawing a knife on him. Caan pushes himself onto the knife, daring the pimp to kill him. Fargas pushes him away and Caan begins to beat on him relentlessly. As he drops his knife, the hooker picks it up and slashes Caan. Staggering from the building, Axel sees his reflection. Blood pours from the wound. He smiles to himself, he has his result! Mahler plays... Also watch out for the scene in the film when Axel and leg-breaker for one of the loan sharks visit a guy who cant pay. The first time you watch this its terrifying.

I enjoyed Sleeper in 1973, when it was first released and, seeing it on a recent, rare appearance on television I was surprised how fresh and amusing it still is.Sleeper comes immediately after Everything You Always Wanted To Know About Sex&#133; in the Allen chronology and his role as a white-faced robot with a shower rose for a mouth is reminiscent of his seminal role as a sperm in that film. These films come as he made the transition from the clumsy slapstick of Bananas and Take the money and run to the more cerebral Annie Hall and Manhatten. In this film, as many other people have commented, he strikes the perfect balance between the visual and verbal aspects of his comedy.The film seems to have been made on a shoestring the stormtroopers wear boiler suits and motorcycle helmets, the futuristic buildings look like a 1970's student hall of residence, the orgasmatron looks like a plastic shower surround.

And that would more-or-less be that. If you like being jolted out of your seat, this movie contains five or six moments that genuinely deliver. That said, if you like movies with a certain level of intelligence and credibility, you might just as well watch an episode of Road Runner (which would be twice as believable and ten times shorter!) It's a fair comment to say that Deep Blue Sea is the very epitome of the no-brainer popcorn flick.A team of scientists working on a cure for Alzheimer's disease have tampered with the genetics of Mako sharks in an effort to speed up their research. Team leader Dr. Susan McCallister (Saffron Burrows) is horrified to learn that her project is about to be shut down so, in an effort to buy more time, she invites one of the main financial backers, Russell Franklin (Samuel L. Jackson), to her oceanic research facility Aquatica to see for himself how close she is to a breakthrough. It quickly becomes apparent that Dr. McCallister's meddling has had an unusual effect upon the three Mako sharks at the facility. She herself admits that as a side-effect, the sharks got smarter. Before long, Franklin, Dr. McCallister and the rest of the research team - chef Sherman Dudley (LL Cool J), Jim Whitlock (Stellan Skarsgaard), diver Carter Blake (Thomas Jane), Tom Scoggins (Michael Rappaport) and Janice Higgins (Jacqueline Mackenzie) - find themselves being hunted by the three hyper-intelligent sharks. And, following an accident which submerges almost the entire research centre, their chances of survival look slim to say the least.... as the sharks smash into the place and glide ominously through the waterlogged corridors in search of human prey.Deep Blue Sea is a very contrived film. The script team of Duncan Kennedy, Donna Powers and Wayne Powers have gone significantly out of their way to devise a sequence of events that manoeuvres the protagonists into danger. The problem is that the whole chain of incident that leads to the submergence of the research facility, and the extra threat posed by the sharks, is too artificially engineered and too low on credibility. No-one seriously buys the idea of accelerating a shark's brain power to cure Alzheimer's. No-one seriously buys the idea that the sharks would consequently develop a desire to kill victims in a pre-meditated manner. Yet the film asks us to take these plot developments oh-so-very seriously (or, at least, there's not enough evidence to suggest that a tongue-in-cheek approach is being employed). Performance-wise, the film asks little of its cast and that's exactly what they give it. There's a little macho posturing, and a few bravura speeches, and that is more-or-less it. The special effects vary in quality, with some good explosions and shark shots, while the actual shark attacks\/killings look laughably fake. The one department where Deep Blue Sea IS effective is in its ability to generate sudden moments of shock. The death of one character after delivering a rousing heroic speech is particularly well-disguised (I'm not saying who, but I'll wager that it'll jolt you pretty good on your first viewing of the movie!) Throughout the film there are similar moments where suspense is nicely created and the pay-off - the scream-out-loud-moment - is well timed. Deep Blue Sea is good for a few scares, but fairly mediocre on other levels.

And that would more-or-less be that. If you like being jolted out of your seat, this movie contains five or six moments that genuinely deliver. That said, if you like movies with a certain level of intelligence and credibility, you might just as well watch an episode of Road Runner (which would be twice as believable and ten times shorter!) It's a fair comment to say that Deep Blue Sea is the very epitome of the no-brainer popcorn flick.A team of scientists working on a cure for Alzheimer's disease have tampered with the genetics of Mako sharks in an effort to speed up their research. Team leader Dr. Susan McCallister (Saffron Burrows) is horrified to learn that her project is about to be shut down so, in an effort to buy more time, she invites one of the main financial backers, Russell Franklin (Samuel L. Jackson), to her oceanic research facility Aquatica to see for himself how close she is to a breakthrough. It quickly becomes apparent that Dr. McCallister's meddling has had an unusual effect upon the three Mako sharks at the facility. She herself admits that as a side-effect, the sharks got smarter. Before long, Franklin, Dr. McCallister and the rest of the research team - chef Sherman Dudley (LL Cool J), Jim Whitlock (Stellan Skarsgaard), diver Carter Blake (Thomas Jane), Tom Scoggins (Michael Rappaport) and Janice Higgins (Jacqueline Mackenzie) - find themselves being hunted by the three hyper-intelligent sharks. And, following an accident which submerges almost the entire research centre, their chances of survival look slim to say the least.... as the sharks smash into the place and glide ominously through the waterlogged corridors in search of human prey.Deep Blue Sea is a very contrived film. The script team of Duncan Kennedy, Donna Powers and Wayne Powers have gone significantly out of their way to devise a sequence of events that manoeuvres the protagonists into danger. The problem is that the whole chain of incident that leads to the submergence of the research facility, and the extra threat posed by the sharks, is too artificially engineered and too low on credibility. No-one seriously buys the idea of accelerating a shark's brain power to cure Alzheimer's. No-one seriously buys the idea that the sharks would consequently develop a desire to kill victims in a pre-meditated manner. Yet the film asks us to take these plot developments oh-so-very seriously (or, at least, there's not enough evidence to suggest that a tongue-in-cheek approach is being employed). Performance-wise, the film asks little of its cast and that's exactly what they give it. There's a little macho posturing, and a few bravura speeches, and that is more-or-less it. The special effects vary in quality, with some good explosions and shark shots, while the actual shark attacks\/killings look laughably fake.

This biopic, and Spike's fifth full-length feature, makes only partial sense as a follow-up to his greatest classics, Do The Right Thing, Mo' Better Blues and Jungle Fever, the three films in which he created and developed his unique voice and made a name for himself as one of the most prominent independent filmmakers in the US; Spike's own voice can barely be heard in Malcolm X, and his usually immediately recognizable trademarks are tough to point out. The reason is that for the first time in his career Spike Lee took a step back, and he is not the dominant personality in the film; the dominant personality is Malcolm X himself, and Spike let Malcolm's voice be heard throughout the film louder than anything else.So Malcolm X is less a work of art and more a statement than Spike's previous films. It's scope is immensely larger than anything he did before &#150; it does, after all, span 200 minutes &#150; and is therefore, naturally, not as tight and focused as Do The Right Thing or Jungle Fever; but in Malcolm X Spike tackles head on the very subjects he treated with symbolism and subtlety in those films, and it was therefore a natural and important progression for him, and a logical continuation of those movies, and in it he proved that he has more than one voice.

The magical component that Stallone achieved was to tell nearly the exact same story, twice in a row, with the same characters... and yet, he gives us a one-two punch that hits just solidly as the first.It's truly a remarkable feat. Differences? We've already met all the characters. Gone is the sense of discovery, the sense of learning who these people are. We already know, don't we? Yet, Stallone's characters are sufficiently interesting enough for us to want to spend more time with them, seeing them in a world most of us don't know, living a life few of us would really want. While the sense of discovery about these characters is gone, our joy of being a voyeur into their world is not.It's a toss up which movie, Rocky or Rocky II, asks us to suspend disbelief more. In Rocky, we have to accept that a nobody, unrated, club fighter could a) get the chance to fight the world champion. B) He could possibly defy all odds and go the distance. That's a huge stretch only possible in Hollywood movies, classifying the first movie as a fairy tale along the lines of Cinderella.Soap opera-esquire is not a bad way to characterize Rocky II because of the emotional ride, but I don't find it as trite as a soap opera. Rocky's actions are very believable, from his earnings feeling like a fortune to him (when they were obviously not), to his illiteracy and his unsophisticated, punch drunk boxer. The ramifications of his past are believable. He fritters away the money and is unable to capitalize on his 15 minutes of fame. Hey, it happens all the time. Very believable.With a pregnant wife, no job, and no way to pay his bills, he's backed into a corner. What's a fighter to do? (And in this case, I mean a fighter in its most literal sense.) He's willing to risk his health and even his marriage to do what any man should do provide for his family.Adrian's bit of drama is the single problem with the movie, but it's also the heart of the movie. It's not a movie about losing it all and coming back again, it's much more than that. It's about a simple man who's trying to do the best he can with the only tools he has. And when Adrian is first to go down for the count, it puts it all in jeopardy.It's not until his wife is ready to accept him as he is, for what he is, that he can continue his quest, one more fight, for his family, for himself.The story arc feels so similar to the first movie that this one is often tossed to the side, yet it truly is amazing how Stallone managed to re-imagine all the magic of the first movie and, better still, give us a second helping of it that's just as sweet.

There is a motivation to the gore and violence here, thanks to the rich characters (many become fully fleshed out so to speak). The limited settings enhance the claustrophobia, still, larger vistas are hinted at and wisely left to the imagination. The cenobites have to be the most striking horror characters created for a modern film, and the first encounter with Pinhead is unforgettable. Back to Bergman, upon watching Cries and Whispers, I noticed some parallels, a dying relative trapped in a room, Erland Josephsons as the doctor, his menacing entrance and cold, ice stare reminiscent of Pinhead. Chris Youngs score is very effective throughout, my favorite moment are the aggressive pounding rhythms heard when Julias murdering spree gathers momentum. Its a pity that the sequels have failed to deliver like this one, although Hellbound have one or two striking moments. The Hellraiser comics could have supplied intriguing material for a sequel or two. One can only hope the franchise shapes up although the chances seem slim after HellraiserDeader and others.

No explosions or fires, and Schwarzenegger doesn't waltz onto the screen. Instead, it's a fascinating study of environmental illness, and it provides no real answers to the questions it raises. Some have noted the film as subversive, but it's also very entertaining (at least for those who appreciate cinema as an art form rather than simply a mindless escape). Demands a fair amount from the viewer, and is very rewarding for those willing to put something into the viewing experience.
