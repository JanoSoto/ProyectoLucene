Craven had been a legend for 3 decades, but with this he made possibly his best known film, reinventing a dead genre for better and worse, making horror films profitable again. More importantly it gave horror fans something to cheer about, a smart, funny, sexy, but above all scary film.Scream's intro has already gone down in movie history as the benchmark of a shocking and effective way to start a film. Take an established actress, and eventually butcher her to set the tone. The phone, knife, shocks, inevitability of death, blood, helplessness, and a love of scary movies. Craven turns what we expect on its head, and we know we are in for something special. We are introduced to Sydney Prescott, a teenager whose mother was murdered a year ago, trying to get on with her life, coping with school, boyfriend, the court case involving Cotton who has been charged with her mother's murder, and intrusion from journalists. She has become strong through this ordeal, but is still vulnerable. Her boyfriend Billy wants sex, but won't push her as she is still a virgin. The news of the new murder comes as a shock to the whole town. Journalists flock in, including Gail Weathers who had accused Sydney of lies. In school the news spreads, and the cops question the students. Sydney's tight group of friends try to work out who it was, believing everyone's a suspect. Her friends are Tatum, feisty, strong whose boyfriend is like her, and Randy, movie nerd who secretly loves Sydney. When Sydney is attacked, it seems the killer is after her. Her father is supposedly out of town and cannot be found, a curfew is ordered and all the kids have a party. Soon the killer attacks, but who is it? This is clearly one of the best horror movies of the decade, not just an excuse for gore, but clever on many levels, and self-referential. It is more than that, being one of the best looks at teenage life in the last few years. The characters are extremely well drawn, taking stereotypes, but changing them against our expectations, enhanced by some brilliant performances. Every cast member performs well, with special mention to Randy, Arquette and Lillard. Cox is good, but Campbell is excellent, going through a myriad of emotions, proving that her character does not have to be stupid like most would typically be.Craven is in control, feeding us clues as to the identity of the killer, but ensuring that by the end we are surprised. Gore is used wonderfully, the scares and jokes are many, but it is the story of Sydney which makes it a classic. She is strong willed, smart, and we go through every emotion with her, aided by Neve's performance. We feel for her, but know we cannot help. The film is shot beautifully, the scenery stunning, an idyllic place to live, but with dark secrets. We get many close-ups of each character's face, Leone style, and we are hurt when one is killed, but become suspicious of each one. The script is sharp with many references to horror movies which the fan will try to recognise.Thematically we return to Elm Street territory. We must fight for ourselves in the world, and while our friends are the most important people in our lives, they may not be around forever and we must be able to cope with their loss. Parents are either not around, don't care, don't understand, or are to blame. Sydney's mum seems to be the catalyst for the deaths, the only authority figure to gain respect is Dewey, who isn't much older than the teens. The opening scene as Casey crawls towards her nearby parents, with the killer behind her highlights this, that the older generation will not always be able to keep us safe. The Headmaster, played by Henry Winkler hates kids, but he cannot organise or gain respect from them either.We are never certain of Gail's intentions, another point to do with the media's involvement in society today. Death has become trivialised, the victims just a ploy for ratings or power for those who tell the stories. Our thoughts on violence, on violent movies are challenged, Craven a veteran of criticism over use of violence. In the end it's up to us as individuals. The film shows that places we believed to be safe-our homes, and schools, have become dangerous places today too, that we are not safe anywhere. In a group, or by yourself, we are still vulnerable. The scene in the school toilets emphasises this point, and is another beautiful scene. However, the film teaches us that rather than being overcome by fear, by the fact that we are not always safe, we should fight.The death scenes and scary parts are memorable. My favourites- Sydney on her porch, staring over the hills, and the scene with Sydney, Billy and Gus's Don't Fear the Reaper playing in the background. It gives a perfect glimpse of what it is like to be in love at that age, and together with Campbell's beauty makes an odd atmosphere, especially when viewed again, having watched the other 2 films. We become intimate with Sydney, wishing we could save her from her pain.With the combination of genres subverted, a brilliant script and score, some excellent acting, good scares and jokes, Scream paved the way for a new breed of horror films, none of which, like Halloween and Elm Street, have matched it. We should be thankful for Craven, as he has provided the world with another film which should be watched and talked about as much as those felt to be the best movies of all time. This is certainly one of the best of our time.

Some have quibbled about the catch-as-catch-can plot (if Geppetto doesn't insist on sending the puppet to school, there would be no movie), or the lack of characterization (even Jiminy Cricket is more of a device than a fully integrated character). But such cavils are blown away by the absolute brilliance of the animation and the pathos of the situations.The early sequence in Geppetto's workshop, with the multitudinous, individualized cuckoo clocks (biergarten ladies in quaint caps, quacking ducks, an annoyed little wooden mom spanking her brat, and on and on -- all of them wheeling in and out of their respective clock portals) immediately sets the highest standard of what the art-form can accomplish. It is a symphony of pure delight. Another insightful reviewer here at IMDb beat me to the punch when he\/she discussed the revolutionary achievement during the Monstro sequences. For the first time, physical scale is integrated within the spatial confines of the animated action fancy words for basically saying that we never lose track of the immensity of the whale. Pinocchio and his family are insignificant gnats compared to the leviathan; and they remain gnats even during the high-speed sequence when Monstro is furiously intent on their destruction. The animation is as disciplined as it is revolutionary.It also may be a little too baroque for very young children. Parents, beware a 3- to 4-year-old will likely be frightened by the whale scenes (that whale is really full of hate), to say nothing of the hallucinatory Pleasure Island sequence in its entirety. The misery-index is disturbingly high after the bad boys start turning into jackasses. The frightening score is emphatic; the suffering is not ameliorated. Indeed, as far as Walt is apparently concerned, these boys get exactly what they deserve, and they are shipped off to the circus or the salt mines . . . FOREVER. They are not rescued. Walt was never above using terror to drive home a moral. Be a good boy . . . or else. Let it also be noted that Honest John the Fox, his feline accomplice, and the scary Coachman (the most frankly evil character in the entire Disney canon) go unpunished. The world is a dark and dangerous place, so you had better let your conscience be your guide, pal.But the movie's darkness is easy to overstate. The virtues of family life provide a haven against the wolves snarling at the door. And in aesthetic terms, one has to merely witness the loving care that is lavished upon, for example, Figaro the kitten -- the thoroughly realistic bodily movement, the jealous but adoring feline temperament -- to come away from *Pinocchio* with the assurance that Life's dark underbelly will not hold sway with artists intent on bringing joy to our children.9 stars out of 10.

But such cavils are blown away by the absolute brilliance of the animation and the pathos of the situations.The early sequence in Geppetto's workshop, with the multitudinous, individualized cuckoo clocks (biergarten ladies in quaint caps, quacking ducks, an annoyed little wooden mom spanking her brat, and on and on -- all of them wheeling in and out of their respective clock portals) immediately sets the highest standard of what the art-form can accomplish. It is a symphony of pure delight. Another insightful reviewer here at IMDb beat me to the punch when he\/she discussed the revolutionary achievement during the Monstro sequences. For the first time, physical scale is integrated within the spatial confines of the animated action fancy words for basically saying that we never lose track of the immensity of the whale. Pinocchio and his family are insignificant gnats compared to the leviathan; and they remain gnats even during the high-speed sequence when Monstro is furiously intent on their destruction. The animation is as disciplined as it is revolutionary.It also may be a little too baroque for very young children. Parents, beware a 3- to 4-year-old will likely be frightened by the whale scenes (that whale is really full of hate), to say nothing of the hallucinatory Pleasure Island sequence in its entirety. The misery-index is disturbingly high after the bad boys start turning into jackasses. The frightening score is emphatic; the suffering is not ameliorated. Indeed, as far as Walt is apparently concerned, these boys get exactly what they deserve, and they are shipped off to the circus or the salt mines . . . FOREVER. They are not rescued. Walt was never above using terror to drive home a moral. Be a good boy . . . or else. Let it also be noted that Honest John the Fox, his feline accomplice, and the scary Coachman (the most frankly evil character in the entire Disney canon) go unpunished. The world is a dark and dangerous place, so you had better let your conscience be your guide, pal.But the movie's darkness is easy to overstate. The virtues of family life provide a haven against the wolves snarling at the door. And in aesthetic terms, one has to merely witness the loving care that is lavished upon, for example, Figaro the kitten -- the thoroughly realistic bodily movement, the jealous but adoring feline temperament -- to come away from *Pinocchio* with the assurance that Life's dark underbelly will not hold sway with artists intent on bringing joy to our children.9 stars out of 10.

Their fleeting time together evolves into romantic interest and they get off the train and spend a night together touring Vienna.The plot, however, says little about the essence of this gem of a movie. Because what we have here is one of the most true, honest looks at what happens when two strangers meet and connect - really connect - that has ever been captured on film.All too often, we talk to people we encounter without truly listening. We anticipate what they're going to say before they even say it, and we talk about superficialities just to fill the silence. What Hawke and Delpy manage to do in Before Sunrise is something altogether different. They really connect, in a way that is at once fleeting but incredibly deep and meaningful.What we're used to seeing in movies is a fast-paced plot and dialogue that carries a scene. In love stories, we rarely get to see why two characters fall in love, or what they actually talk about. Often movies skip over the happy scenes, showing characters strolling hand in hand with ice cream while a pop song plays on the soundtrack. We see them talking and laughing but we never know what it is that they are talking or laughing about. The subtle message is that it doesn't matter.Before Sunrise tells us that it does matter. It matters more than anything. Because we see all the dialogue between these characters, including the awkward silences, the fillers, the so-called meaningless conversation that most other movies would skip over.There are some tangential characters that the two encounter, and there's some scenery (Vienna is of course the setting and it's a beautiful city) but all of that is peripheral; the movie focuses on the two characters and their interactions together. There is no formula here, no neat-as-a-bow happy endings. No, these are real people, sharing their views and thoughts and hopes and dreams. We never learn much about them in terms of biographical details. They don't share their resumes the way so many strangers do when they meet. No, theirs is a connection at a deeper level.This movie stayed with me because I felt it was so realistic and true-to-life. It's also a little sad; what does it really mean if you meet someone and connect like that and then maybe never see them again? What are we after if not a connection like that? But on the other hand, that's why it works so well. We see many instances where the two characters clash on views and outlooks and politics and philosophies, but because their time together is so fleeting, none of these things become issues. We get the sense that a long-term relationship between them would never work, but that the chance one day encounter is going to stay with them forever.In fact, though I'm told the sequel (Before Sunset) is fantastic, I'm reluctant to see it. I prefer to see the ending as open, because it was so perfect in the context of the film.Before Sunrise is an honest, touching, wonderfully acted film that is sure to captivate anyone who sees it.

This film gives you a picture of a little bit of both as it intelligently explores five of the people behind the stereotypes.Five students - Andy (Emilio Estevez), the jock; Brian (Anthony Michael Hall), the brain; Bender (Judd Nelson), the hood; Claire (Molly Ringwald), the princess; and Allison (Ally Sheedy), the basket case - are assigned an all day detention on a Saturday. We are given a glimpse of their relationships with their parents as they are dropped off, and then they are greeted by their principal (Paul Gleason), a somewhat belligerent man who occasionally crosses the line into abuse. Their assignment for the day is to write an essay for the principal, who comes back periodically with the intent to do little else other than abuse them some more. While the five distinctive personalities clash in the beginning, with almost violent results, eventually, boredom and a little pot get them talking with each other, and we see how each of them feels the pressure of their assigned role, and what it's doing to them.It's a talky movie, so there's little action, although there is a rather amusing - and exciting - chase scene. The high school it's set in looks depressing enough to suck the life out of anyone, which helps add to the feelings of being trapped that everyone in the movie seems to have. This is used very effectively to tell the story.What is interesting about this movie is the character portrayal. The characters are distinctive, moving beyond the stereotype to the real person underneath. While these students are perhaps more self aware than we would expect of students that age at that time, they do articulate their angst about life in a believable way. With them, we come to see the similarities in the pressures that their peers and parents put on them, and that they put on themselves. We see how much they dislike the inauthenticity of their lives, and how powerless they feel to stop it. Their powerlessness even relates to their new friendships, as Claire articulates just how hard it would be for them to move beyond their defined boundaries to maintain their friendships with each other. This lack of sugar coating makes for a much more powerful message in the end.The acting in the film is generally quite good. John Kapelos gives a scene stealing performance as the worldly wise janitor, while Paul Gleason goes way over the top as the principal (to the occasional detriment of the scenes he's in). The leads all give solid performances. Anthony Michael Hall plays the high school nerd to perfection, unable to comprehend that things are not necessarily how he thinks they should be. Molly Ringwald gives enough depth to her performance that you like Claire even though she is spoiled. Emilio Estevez gives us a sense of the anger of someone who has been pushed to bring misery to someone else in order to cover his own insecurities. Ally Sheedy plays her character's strangeness to perfection. But Judd Nelson arguably gives the strongest performance as a disadvantaged teen who knows a lot more than he lets on.If you don't like psycho babble, this film may not be for you.

I must say that i am of a different opinion. I would rather have to say that this is one of the most overrated movies of our time.The story of the Cuban immigrant going from having nothing to controlling the drug-trade in Miami, making millions and millions of dollars, is nothing spectacular. The same story has been made numerous times both before and after. This however is not necessarily anything negative. The story does have it's points. What i can't help feeling is that the story has been done so much better before. While there are many things separating The Godfather parts 1 and 2 from Scarface, too many things to really compare them, the Godfather movies were still a so much better tale of an immigrants rise to criminal fame and riches.The main problem i have with Scarface however is that most of the time i don't even know if it's being serious or not. Simply because everything is so ridiculously over the top. Wardrobe, acting, music, cinematography and not least the dialog. It's all bordering on comedy, and sometimes quite blatantly stepping over that border. The most shining example is Al Pacino. A talented actor no doubt. But his accent here is... i can't even find the right word to describe it. It comes and goes through the whole movie, and his English is more broken in the finale than ever before in the movie (his English is WORSE in the end than it was when he first came to the US.

Through its bold and fearless acting (especially Edward Norton, absolutely brilliant) clever writing and masterful direction, American History X challenges the viewer to face the truth about hate in today's society. From the beginning of his career, Edward Norton has continually progressed as an actor constantly challenging himself artistically with projects that push the envelope of mainstream film-making and American History X is the prime example of his dedication. Norton plays Derek Vineyard, a former neo-Nazi skin head who just served three years in prison for killing a black gang member in self defense. Seeing the error in his ways, he returns from prison reformed vowing to stop his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong) from going down a similar path. From the beginning, Norton is nothing short of brilliant in his Oscar nominated role. His dedication was both emotional and physical; Norton gained 30 pounds of muscle for the role and is covered in tattoos, including a swastika. His presence and intensity command the screen so convincingly that the viewer needs to be reminded they're watching a film, not a documentary. In one of the film's most powerful scenes, Derek is talking to his brother about what happened to him in prison and what changed him. Norton uses body language and eye movement to create the most memorable monologue in recent film history. He looks at Danny with such conviction and says Looking back I can't believe I bought into all this s#$@, all this hate, this anger. It's just because I was p------ off, and I'm tired of being p------ off, Danny, it's not worth it. Aside from Norton, the supporting cast even the most trivial roles are top notch. Edward Furlong is perfect as Derek's brother Danny who's confused about his views and searching for truth in the ugly world of racism consumed by propaganda and contradiction. The rest of the cast including Guy Torry, Beverly D'Angelo and Avery Brooks as Derek's black High School English teacher who ends up mentoring him and steering him down the right path.The central point of the entire film is that hate and anger is nothing but baggage. The script carried this out with it's pace, intense dialogue and construction but the film needed a director with a strong visual sense to show the viewer what hate does to a society, a family and a man. Tony Kaye not only directed the film but also operated the camera for the film and was the lead cinematographer. Visually, the film is a flat out masterpiece from start to finish. By using color changes, time sequencing, and flashbacks, the film uses visuals to tell the story and metaphorically shed light on racism.When we see Derek out of prison, the film is shown in color to show how he sees everything clearly. While Derek is in prison and while he still had racist views, the film is shown in black and white to symbolize how he and other racists did not see minorities as people, just statistics. In the film's most beautiful scene, Derek returns home from prison and has reformed in his ways. He spends time with Danny and one by one, they take down all the posters and banners promoting racism and hate hanging in their room. Derek quietly out of the room to take a shower. The lush cinematography captures every single water drop as it falls off his body. The scene is crosscut with a flashback of Derek and Danny together on the beach as young children. The scene suggests all he has to live for and his love for his brother. At the end of scene, Derek steps out of the shower refreshed, as if he's just washed away his sins and has forgiven himself for his past. He looks in the mirror and slowly places his right hand over his heart, covering his swastika tattoo. Though very little is spoken, this scene is at the heart of the film's purpose and passion.The reason the film is so brilliant and why it works is the way the script is handled and translated to screen. The film proves its point about hate and anger through pacing, clever dialogue and offers an intelligent point of view on controversial issues impacting today's society. Issues such as gang violence, the job market and the Rodney King trials are topics concerning Americans today. The white supremacists are viewed as highly educated people with intelligent opinions concerning the issues of minorities in our society. The film looks at these points objectively and suggests that while these points are good, they are biased, unfair and illogical considering the basis for these arguments are hate and anger.American History X is quite simply the best film concerning racism ever made. It's more than just a great piece of cinema; it's a work of art. Through the powerful performances, masterful direction and thought provoking script, American History X is a testament to the truth about hate in our society and our world.

Colin Firth is so wooden he has caused me to re-evaluate my opinion of the acting talent of Keanu Reeves. The film is nominally a romantic comedy, but the degree of apparent romantic attraction between Bridget and Mark (Firth) can only be described as microscopic even at the end of the film, when they've managed to get together. It's also hard to see what Daniel (Grant's 'Mr. Wrong') sees in Bridget, who is consistently presented unattractively, with respect to clothing, behavior, physical attributes, and personality. Perhaps it's that the two of them are equally shallow. As for comedy, the film (ie. the director) time after time walks away from potential significant comic scenes with a whimper, not a bang. This, after taking some pains to set those scenes up. Cases in point the fire station interview, and the tarts and vicars party. In both of these cases we are apparently supposed to take the semi-exposure of Bridget's ample backside as sufficient comic payoff for the setup. This is more like British TV humor of the Benny Hill genre than what I expect to see as humor in a major motion picture. Given all of the above, and in all fairness, there are indeed four reasons to see this film (1) Bridget's speech at the book launch, which is actually quite funny, (2) the fight between Daniel and Mark with their apologetic asides to the restaurant patrons as they trash the place, (3) Zellweger's British accent, which I wouldn't have thought possible, and (4) Daniel's stunning book-lined apartment, which appears, unfortunately, only briefly.

This is more like British TV humor of the Benny Hill genre than what I expect to see as humor in a major motion picture. Given all of the above, and in all fairness, there are indeed four reasons to see this film (1) Bridget's speech at the book launch, which is actually quite funny, (2) the fight between Daniel and Mark with their apologetic asides to the restaurant patrons as they trash the place, (3) Zellweger's British accent, which I wouldn't have thought possible, and (4) Daniel's stunning book-lined apartment, which appears, unfortunately, only briefly. None of these, of course, are important.

It was not at all what I expected when I first watched it, so I was unsure of it. But I watched it again and now I love this movie and own it on VHS. It is hard hitting and hard to watch in places. But also very tender in a subtle sort of way in others. It confronts all the issues laid out in the movie with gusto. It is what I would call a no holds barred movie. It follows the lives of two very different people and their families and the people that they meet in everyday life. After a series of unfortunate, and sometimes tragic events these two people's lives become intertwined. In every day life, there are issues of racism, the death penalty, abuse and loneliness for these people. Tragedy strikes the two main characters, Hank and Leticia, in different ways yet the tragedy is similar in that they both lose their sons. The fact that they have this in common brings them together in an ironic twist. Sex also plays a part in how this movie progresses. From signifying the loneliness of a man who has to depend on a prostitute for affection, to the need of two ordinary people to get a respite, even if temporary, from a lot of heartache. The movie pivots on the latter of these sex scenes. It gives Hank and Leticia hope that things may not be so bad from now on. It is a raw, emotional and explicit scene, but it works because it is essential to the plot. After this the movie explores the highs and lows of their relationship. But you want things to work out between them after all that has happened. Can they learn to overcome their personal tragedies? Can they learn to love again? What does the future hold? If you want to know the answers, watch this movie. I would recommend it to anyone who is open minded about the issues dealt with in this movie. In my opinion Halle Berry deserved the Oscar.

The concept of a monster that hunts you in your dreams - and follows you when you wake - was original for horror flicks.Mass murderer Fred Krueger (Englund) had killed 20+ children with the now-infamous claw-glove - an ordinary working glove outfitted with 4 straight razor blades. When he was caught by Lt. Don Thompson (Saxon) and a group of officers from the Springwood Police, several bodies of the town's murdered children were found in the boiler room where he worked. (This boiler room became the setting for the nightmares of the Elm St. teenagers in the film.) Unfortunately, as young Nancy Thompson (Langenkamp) finds out later in the film, a legal technicality sprung this monster loose from police custody. Krueger was followed to the boiler room, which an angry mob of parents torched with gasoline. Krueger burned to death inside. (Adapted from The Nightmares on Elm Street novel).Years after his death, the ghost of Fred Krueger returns - this time in the nightmares of the children whose parents had torched the boiler room and killed him. Nancy and her friends Tina (Wyss), Rod (Corri), and Glen (Depp), are experiencing nerve-wracking nightmares involving a deformed madman in a dirty red & green sweater, who is horribly burned, and wearing a glove outfitted with 4 razor-sharp blades on the fingers! Tina is the first to encounter him, first in his boiler room - from which she escapes - and again in an alley behind her home. This time, she is killed by Krueger in the dream and dies in reality - a violent, frightening death while her boyfriend Rod watches helplessly. Next morning, Rod is arrested by Nancy's dad as an obvious suspect. But Nancy has a horrifying nightmare at school in which she also encounters the horrible man with the finger-knives, and narrowly escapes. Realizing that before her death Tina had described the EXACT SAME man to her, Nancy visits Rod in police custody where he describes having a similar nightmare - in which he ALSO faced the monster with knives for fingers. When Nancy has another dream encounter with Krueger - in which she sees Krueger threatening Rod - she & Glen go to her dad's precinct and urge him to check on Rod. But by the time they reach the cell, Rod is dead - the victim of a hanging by Krueger. At Rod's funeral, Nancy describes the man in the dirty sweater and deadly finger-knives who killed Tina & Rod to her father - and a disturbing look crosses her dad's face. Nancy's mom takes her to a sleep-disorder research clinic, where Nancy has another frightening nightmare involving Krueger. This time, she emerges with a bloody gash from Krueger's blades, and something more disturbing - the old fedora hat that Krueger always wore. It is only after learning Krueger's identity that Nancy's mother reveals the true story of Fred Krueger to her daughter. Armed with this knowledge, Nancy goes about preparing herself for the final confrontation with Krueger, to bring him into her world in the same way she did with his hat - and hopefully to erase Krueger for good.In the DVD commentary, director Wes Craven described the story that inspired his concept of Fred Krueger as the demonic presence that haunts people's nightmares. Apparently it was based on a series of true events involving children of immigrants from Thailand who were living in the Los Angeles area. The children had been describing horrific nightmares to their parents and were terrified of going to sleep. In 1 case a child stayed awake for 7 days. Their parents brushed off their children's concerns, and several died in their sleep. I had never heard of this until watching the DVD version 18 years after I first saw the film! Despite its low budget, the film still does an awesome job of creating the illogicality of nightmares, such as the appearance of the sheep in the boiler room and the 20-foot-long arms that Krueger extends across the alley to block Tina's escape, not to mention Tina's terrible death which was made in a revolving room set.Still the most frightening of them all!

So he decides to pick up his brother first. During a pit stop, Fuller has a mechanic install a CB radio. They joke around with truckers, going so far as posing as a woman and setting up a false date with one. When the prank turns to tragedy, the trucker seeks revenge.For the most part, Joy Ride is an enjoyable horror\/thriller. It is loaded with tension and it's easy for viewers to picture themselves in the scenario, as it's relatively realistic. The horror is formed from everyday situations, where just a couple bad decisions can lead one into the sights of a madman.However, I had to subtract two points for something I very rarely subtract points for--stupid decisions on the part of protagonists. Of course, some people think that horror films are primarily based on characters making stupid decisions, but in my view of the genre, even if such actions are clichéd, filmmakers generally justify such decisions at least in the context of the film. Too often in Joy Ride, writers Clay Tarver and J.J. Abrams, along with director John Dahl, make little attempt at justification. Why don't they just turn the CB off? Why don't they just ignore the villain? Why don't they call the police? Why don't they stay in places that are more populated (like the truckstop)? Why do they keep trusting the villain? While there are some cursory answers to a few of these questions, taken together, you keep wondering, In the film's world, how can someone so stupid be in college? One possible answer is suggested by the Joy Ride DVD. It contains a 29-minute alternate ending that thankfully has a bit of commentary from both the director and the writer. The alternate ending is just is good as the theatrical version, in my opinion, and tries to put a slightly more logical spin on the film. Our heroes do end up at a police station, with some police cooperation. However, it was apparently felt that this alternate (actually the original) ending didn't work and didn't maintain tension. Abrams felt that involving the police more directly in the plot removed too much of the focus from our heroes. Dahl also states that he thought there was too much character development in the original ending. I beg to differ on all of those points. Although the revised ending has many positive aspects not found in the original--especially a Rube Goldberg-like scenario involving maximum, immediate risk and creating maximum tension, the original ending may have worked better overall in my opinion.But Joy Ride is good enough overall to transcend stupid decisions on the part of the characters. If seen as a sequence of high-tension scenarios, where logical plot connectors are only secondary to creating thrilling rides, Joy Ride almost deserves an A (a 9 in my rating system). There isn't a scenario in the film that's not smart and inventive in some way. The three principles--Walker, Zahn and Sobieski--give good performances, and the villain is masterfully done by Matthew Kimbrough (who provided the body), Ted Levine (who provided the bizarre, creepy voice), and Dahl, who wisely shows glimpses of him, but only glimpses. The villain is almost supernatural in his cleverness, strength and obsession. It's just too bad that we haven't had a sequel yet.

In between the scenes when Marty was recovered in the McFly home in 1885 by his great great grandparents and when Marty arrived back home to the year 1985 I found this film quite boring, but before and after those scenes, I found this film quite entertaining.In all three Back to the Future films there's sequences in which Marty and his descendants\/ancestors are being confronted in a cafe\/bar by Biff and his descendants\/ancestors as well as when Marty injures himself and ends up being recovered in his mothers\/great great grand mothers home and including a few other examples. I quite like this repeated sequence in the first two films, but seeing it again in the third film simply bored me, for its as though the same old storyline in all three films is being regurgitated over and over again with no originality whatsoever.If you think about it, there's no reason why Marty should have been temporarily stuck in the year 1885. The fact that Marty and the Doc couldn't fuel-up the delorean as there was no fuel(gas) facility in the year 1885 shouldn't have been a problem. Why - because if Doc Brown was able to write Marty a letter from the year 1885, for Marty to receive in the year 1955, and as a result of the letter Marty then went back in time to the year 1885, he could of also easily written another letter to Marty to receive in the year 1955 saying 'Oh yeah and by the way bring an extra supply of gas(fuel) when you visit me in the year 1885 for its the only way we can get back home to the future'. If he wrote that letter the moment he'd given it to Western Union postal Service, the fuel would have instantaneously appeared with them in the year 1885 and they would have been able to get back home to the year 1985, without going though the hassle of being pushed by a runaway train in order to get up to 88 miles per hour. This is just one example on how this film didn't make sense as there are many more examples similar to this one that I won't get into. One good element about this film is how it shows how bad things happen for a reason. When Marty went back in time and changed his parents destiny from being losers to winners, he not only changed his families past and present lives, but he also changed his families future - but for the worst. Seeing as Marty changed his fathers destiny, as a result of this change his father George McFly didn't loan his 4 by 4 jeep to Biff, for which Biff would've smashed up in a car accident in the parallel universe for when George was afraid of Biff. If Marty didn't change his fathers destiny, his father George McFly would've loaned the jeep to Biff out of fear and the car would've have been totalled in a car crash. That car was destined to crash! so that Marty and his girlfriend Jennifer wouldn't have used it that night to go camping, in which they wouldn't have crashed it out of a dare from Douglas Needles to go drag racing - leaving their and their children's lives in ruins, for which this car crash led to a result of their children being arrested in the year 2015, however their children's problems in the year 2015 was fixed when Marty and the Doc changed it for when they travelled into the future to the year 2015. It goes to show that although Marty did change his families lives for the better, in the long run it would have been better if he had left things the way they were. Destiny is set for a reason, whether its good or bad.I think making a third sequel to this film was a good idea, but I think it would have been a lot better if the director of this film made this sequel completely different from the first two films. A good idea would have been if Marty and the Doc were travelling all over time to different years doing whatever they want and meeting up with themselves in the same year that they've visited more than once without worrying about a time travel paradox. In my opinion this film could have improved, but even though I feel this way I'd recommend anyone to watch it, for it did have some good moments and if you've seen the first two 'Back to the Future' films you've gotta see this film in order to complete the trilogy.
