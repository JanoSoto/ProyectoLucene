He finds her again and takes her ashore to learn to be human for a bit. He lives in Manhattan, hence why she coins her name after Madison Ave. They fall in love and she catches the attention of the scientific community and is kidnapped. The point? She misses the water too much and makes Tom a merman to live happily ever after. I liked the movie as a kid and probably still do now. It was cute and you can see the humble beginnings of Tom Hanks.

Eastwood is Lee Marvin, and pretty good at that. Mario Van Peebles, overacting as usual, is John Cassavettes, and a weak one at that. there's a huge guy named Swede that is the Clint Walker of the film. & there's the same situation where Eastwood fights the Swede to prove his formidable strength to his troop; the same thing happens with Lee Marvin and Walker. weakling Boyd Gaines is the skinny equivilant to the neutral George Kennedy. and of course there's the bad guy Lt. played by Everette McGill that is the shadow of Dirty Dozen's Robert Ryan. and there's Eastwood's old war buddy who backs him up and is hard as nails and had wartime expirience with him, this the equivilant to the legendary Ralph Meeker's too-small role in Dozen. okay, okay, enough comparisons already. the surprise here is that i liked the DIRTY COUSIN even better than DOZEN. while it's corny and dated (Mario Van Peebles cannot be more 80s) it's a very entertaining movie from beginning to end. you get a lot of action and a lot of good times, even if the jokes aren't too funny. it's very tuff sitting thru Peebles acting as if he were playing guitar and rapping in a redneck bar (and having fans at that), but it all grows on you, somehow, by the end. and hey, speaking of end - there's a different ending on the DVD.

I loved all the performances. Although some scenes did make me angry I thoroughly enjoyed it. I'm not a particular fan of Billy Bob Thornton, but he is a very good actor. I didn't like his character at first because of how racist he was and how he caused his son's suicide but once he hooked up with Halle Berry's character all his old ways changed. Halle Berry deserved that Oscar. I liked her character because of how lonely she was. Her husband has been killed in the electric chair and her son has been killed in a car accident. Although I didn't like how she treated her son because of his eating habits, she truly loved him and his death just tore her apart. I think if she hadn't met Billy Bob, then she probably would have killed herself. She just didn't have anything to live for after her family died. I can see why some people would be upset by the sex scene between Billy Bob and Halle but it was necessary. Hank and Leticia needed each other. And I loved the fact that she helped him get over his prejudice ways. And I was so glad when he put his father in the nursing home. What an ass! Saying that rude comment in front Leticia. She didn't deserve that. I did think it was a little sad when Hank puked after having sex with Leticia but that didn't stop him from wanting to be with her.  Heath Ledger's small part was good. I felt so sorry for him because of his father telling him that he never loved him. That would make someone commit suicide! P. Diddy had a great role as well. It's always sad to see someone die in the electric chair. I can't imagine how horrible that must be to experience.  I thought the ending of this movie was somewhat disappointing  but it didn't make me hate the movie. I really liked this movie and all the actors gave great performances.

Every thing that made the first and second one enjoyable were missing. Characters like Taggert and Boghamil were gone, and the unfunny Judge Reinhold is left with the NYPD BLUE guy and an almost embarassing Broson Pinchot. Those faults would be bad enough. But no, they weren't the only ones in this trash. A weak and formulaic storyline, cheezy, campy violence filled this movie.

It lacks the stability to be considered a good film even when you don't compare it to its predecessors.

August finds himself through helping Annalees.It's beautifully filmed and very stirring, with the kind of conclusion that makes many other films seem incomplete and shallow. This is an excellent film. It's also very family-friendly aside from some thematic elements (a slave is cleaved in half, animals are slaughtered, and so forth). I purchased it on a whim and never regretted the twenty bucks I spent. Everyone should see this at least once.

He keeps forcing questions until Jon admits he raped her - a statement Vince captures on tape.  With Amy on the way to the room to meet Vince to catch up, the stage is set for old secrets and hurts to be unearthed.Having seen Dogma recently, I am weary of critics just calling things a `filmed play' because I know from that film that the media can add a lot to a play.  However here the fact that it has been filmed adds nothing of value to what is essentially a good story with good dialogue and interesting characters.  The camera zooms back and forward between people as they talk and it lies back as an observer but really it just serves to distract than add.  I will ignore the media for now though, and look at the content. The film is compelling and enjoyable and I would love to see it as a play; the basic story twists and turns with slight touches.  I didn't know where it was going and I was held by it more or less for the whole film - only a slow start hindered my enjoyment of it.The dialogue is great - it fits the characters and rarely sounds forced or contrived.  Sadly the bits that do sound forced are entirely the fault of Ethan Hawke.  As much as I feel for the problems and hurts he must now have, his performance at the start is pretty poor.  He forces his character and doesn't convince as Vince.  Happily he is carried for the majority of the film as the focus leaves him and settles on Jon and then Amy.  Leonard is really quite good and his character is convincing.  Thurman's character has to veer all over the place and she deals with it very well.  Those who believe she was `acting' in Kill Bill should see this film for an idea of what she looks like when she acts!As a film, I don't know what to say.  In a way I am glad it was a film because it brought it to my attention and I may not have seen it otherwise, but that isn't enough by itself.  I don't understand why Linklater simply filmed the play as if it occurred on a stage.  I accept that it was done on the cheap but placing it on film should have added to it - sadly it only serves to take away.  A good play can have intimacy even with a large audience; the film should have easily been intimate as it can get as close as it wants, but the spinning camera etc damage it in that regard.Overall this is well worth seeing.  The material is well written and engaging, while the cast are very good despite carrying Hawke.  I just wish that the committing to film and the direction of Linklater had added something to it.

This was where the cast and crew were supposed to pick up filming of Superman II in early February of 1979. However a new order was called in by producer Ilya Salkind. A new director to be exact, and that was the dellima of Superman II. In 1977-78, Richard Donner shot a near estimate of 80 % of Superman II simultaneously with Superman, but that is not the point. The point is that his version was a much more subtle version, which followed the characters emotions from the blockbuster first film, and had an exciting plot of Lois and Superman falling in love, villains killing earth beings, and Superman almost having to risk it all for the world...or the woman he loves! But when director Richard Lester came in to do reshoots and shoot all new scenes, he had a different vision in mind. His version was simple. Make the villains look like dumb butts, while Lois and Superman enjoy an unequal relationship where Lois is given the back seat treatment to mediocre looks and a Superman that would rather make the metropolis people laugh than save the world! As that is what so wrongly happens, we shall go over the facts. Superman and Lois are supposed to have the kind of love that EVERY American dreams of having. Donner insured this in never seen love scenes which would have garnered the film an R-rating. Lester's love scenes are cheap and tacky with hilarious dialogue and no wit to back it up. The villains scenes in the Donner version are cruel, ruthless, and downright evil. In Lester's scenes, the villains pronounce names wrong, look at eachother in stupidity, and act like imbeciles. The film had a good premise going for it Superman has just saved the world from nuclear destruction and then the villains arrive and start destruction. Meanwhile, Lois and Superman fall in love. That was still the plot, but the myth and mystique which made the original film such a classic are nowhere to be seen here. Instead we get NASA jerks talking about a curl in space! Lester was really trashing the mythology with this peice of junk. America had thought that the second Superman film would be a film that they would remember. No such luck as one would have guessed. The film is basically two unfinished films sloppily put together in this turkey! Superman II is NOT without interest. In fact, alot of the scenes are fun to watch because of the action sequences. But it is true what others say, that it seems like Lester was trying at a Beatles\/Superman film. Clumsy comedy and stupid chaos ensues as the villains blow through metropolis. Another thing that gets on this writer's nerves is when the townspeople are rooting for Superman in the battle sequence! This villains are trying to kill these people and what do they do? They don't run in fear as they should, but root for Superman when he beats the villains up, calling out rediculous dialogue such as C'mon! Get 'em Superman! as if they are present at a high school football match! Too much stupid writing and directing. I will always have respect for Superman II because the whole Superman series has been a part of my better memories in life for a long time. We have yet to see if the true version of Superman will ever be released on DVD, in the form of the Richard Donner cut, as so many fans like to call it. IT is really Ilya Salkinds cut, as he has the contract to the rights of ALL the films(including Supergirl) and their footage. All in all, Superman II fails on a lot of top levels but has the interest for lower levels.

I was a little skeptical about watching it because I'm not a huge fan of Jennifer Aniston but it was like 3AM and there was nothing else to watch so my mom and I decided on this movie. It was so good! It was somewhat slow-moving, but it had a great storyline. All the actors gave great performances. Especially Aniston. She was convincing as the bored store clerk who can't conceive with her pot-smoking painter husband (John C. Reilly). I liked Reilly's character, though. Even though he smoked pot occasionally he was generally a sweetheart and he loved Justine dearly. And I thought it was kinda sad when he hit her for having an affair and he was truly sorry for what he'd done. His actions really broke his heart. Anyways. Jake Gyllenhaal was great as Holden. I thought his character was somewhat disturbed though. He seemed really sweet but once Justine stopped wanting sex and tried to get him to go to the hospital for help he would just snap and get angry. It was like he had multiple personalities. It was real shocking to find out that he killed himself. Over Justine!!  And I thought it was sh*tty of Bubba to blackmail her by making her sleep with him so he wouldn't tell her husband about her infidelities. I couldn't imagine how she must've felt. What I really liked about this movie was that I felt so sympathetic for Justine because of all the wrong she done when she didn't really want to do it and all the tragedies that are happening around her. It seemed like she should've been the one to kill herself instead of Holden! But I liked the ending and even though the baby wasn't her husband's, she still loved him enough to be with him and lie to him. He was nice and really good to her. I liked how all the characters were well written and you got the feel of each one's personality. Well, I liked this film and thanks for reading my review. P.S.

Alan Parker povides the film with a new kind of shrieking score that makes the feel a little eerie as the original shark theme is put to the test, and brought to a new level of scary. What most call boring, is the intellectual discussions that the main characters speak of as they, being adults, must deal with the water crises in the most mature way they can. Different ideas of murder, explosions, and captivity are all the order of the evening as the exposition is revealed. Later, the film takes a plunge when hungry mamma is let out, and all hell breaks loose, literally. Not so much the scares, as the shocks, are what draws me to this film, and every minute is worth while. Never trust the ocean, it is always full of suprises, and in all the wrong ways. Yes, the 3rd demension is pure terror, and Jaws 3-D will not fail to serve audiences with a real bang and boom! 9\/10 ","genre":"Horror"},{"date":"23 March 2004","score":"4 out of 8 people found the following review useful","review":"  I absolutley love this movie, i thought it was one of the best romantic comedies i had seen in a while, it was smart, yet interesting.

Makes you look at this movie a little more analytically. Parents treat their kids like mini-adults and pressure them into being something at all costs just to realize the American Dream. Whatever that is. These kids represent those pressures and isolation. Claire, the popular prom princess who's used as leverage between rivalling parents; John, the punk bad boy with a foul mouth and abusive family; Andrew, the jock with no mind of his own; Allison, the emotionally unstable psycho with no friends and a bit of a compulsive\/pathological liar. She's unsatisfied with her home life and wants to run away. And Brian, the geek who would rather commit suicide than face his parents about failing shop class. Each one feel pressure from parents, friends, and themselves to be or act a certain way. We can all relate to that. Yet, I can see why they're called the brat pack. You find it a little annoying that all it takes is some middle class kids to have some problems for people to be aware. What about urban kids who face these issues? Nobody doing a movie about their issues till Dangerous Minds or unknown films. It's sad that this country doesn't care about anything til it hits a certain class.

But more importantly, it is one of the downright BEST films ever made. Walt Disney has given us some of the most popular and utterly entertaining motion pictures of all time -- among them Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, Alice in Wonderland, and Beauty and the Beast (which remains the only animated film to be nominated for a Best Picture Academy Award to date) --, but none were more daring (or interesting) than this. It is a genuine one-of-a-kind movie experience -- a seamless visualization of classical pieces that can be appreciated on so many different levels. Firstly (and foremostly) there is the animation, which was not only groundbreaking but appallingly well-done; each image is so meticulous and beautiful that it could almost stand alone as a silent film. But the music does, indeed, play a major role here in fact -- as is joked about at one point by narrator Deems Taylor -- the soundtrack itself is the principal character of the picture. The film can be broken down into nine distinct segments first, there is Bach's Toccata and Fugue, set to abstract orchestral images; that is followed by my personal favorite, The Nutcracker Suite by Tchaikovsky; next we have the most popular vignette (it was originally intended to be a film of its own), Paul Dukas's The Sorcerer's Apprentice, in which Mickey Mouse is immortalized as a magician who can't control a group of renegade brooms; Stravinsky's Rite of Spring is set to a prehistoric visualization, and Greek mythology provides the setting for Beethoven's Pastoral Symphony (the most controversial number of the movie -- the original print featured potentially racist imagery that has since been cropped out); Ponchielli's Dance of the Hours is oddly (yet very successfully) performed by a ballet company of ostriches, hippos, elephants, and crocodiles; A Night on Bald Mountain by Modest Mussorgsky is set to a surprisingly dark vignette of Satan summoning spirits, and it is countered by a very tranquil and spiritual representation of Schubert's Ave Maria. Fantasia is possibly the most unpretentious art movie ever made it doesn't assume that it's great, or even pretend to be anything more than light entertainment, and yet it is -- it is SO much more. With this film, Walt Disney opened the door for many future abstract film-makers, proving that you don't necessarily need a story as an excuse for your imagery. In fact, the parts that work best in Fantasia are those that DON'T have any particular meaning (see The Nutcracker Suite). But more than anything, this movie is a true American classic; its visuals have given new life to musical pieces that could have otherwise gone forgotten (in watching it today, you can tell things have changed when Taylor states that The Nutcracker hasn't been performed much), and they have fueled the imagination of many generations of viewers. Fantasia is innovative, imaginative, and creative -- it never ceases to amaze me with just how much it accomplishes; more than sixty years following its initial release, it remains just as important and timeless. While you could argue that it doesn't amount to much as a whole, you'd be missing the point each gorgeous frame of this masterwork speaks for itself, whether or not it really adds up to anything.Grade A+ ","genre":null},{"date":"23 March 2004","score":"","review":"  I was the kind of geek that watched Fantasia a lot when he was a kid, and I must confess that, even after all of these years, it remains one of my very favorite films.
