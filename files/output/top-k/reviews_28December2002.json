As a girl I admit that I was first interested in the eye candy that is Vin Diesel but as the movie played on I really got a good glimpse that it is still possible to make a good science fiction movie.The one problem with this story is that we are led somewhere and then totally jerked in another direction.  What i'm talking about is about 20 or so minutes into the film we are believing that we are going to get an awesome insight into the mysterious Riddick and then all of sudden it's WTF it's dark and aliens are eating the crew!.  Granted no the aliens weren't uninteresting or anything but Riddick was what got me interested, and I don't mean Vin I mean his character.  I wanted to know what he had done, and wanted to hear more about him (BTW I hear they are making a Riddick movie sometime in the future sort of a prequel).There are some good characters that I cared about and then there are some Oh well they're dead.  I never got around to caring about Fry so the ending didn't hurt me none.  Despite the fact that no the movie didn't go where I wished it would have it was still a great movie and enjoyable.  Though you do have to overlook some parts, like how they so conveniently landed on the planet on the one day a year there is an eclipse.  I think if you don't dig too far into it you'll find that you'll enjoy it.  It is really quite a simple movie and you won't forget Vin Diesel's Riddick.9 out of 10 stars.

E.T. joined Michael and Elliott when they go trick or treating, then Elliott and E.T. head to the middle of the forest and set up the communicator made from a record player, umbrella, spelling computer, saw blade, etc. It worked! Now all they could do was wait. Next day, Elliott came home and didn't look so good. Michael found E.T. who was pale, weak and not feeling good at all. Things were about to get worse, for the men from the forest, who were actually government agents, barged into the house along with scientists and guys from NASA in space suits. They began running tests on Elliott and E.T. Elliott seemed fine but E.T. was fading fast. Elliott tried to stop the men from working on him but they ignored him, except for one man, Keys, who felt for Elliott and E.T., he actually appeared to care! Well, matters got even worse. E.T. stopped breathing and was declared dead. Elliott said a few kind words to him and soon his red heart glowed brightly and E.T. came back to life! He knew his people were coming to get him. Michael and Elliott make a plan to get E.T. to the forest and it works pretty good! They steal a van and ditch some agents, but then the cops are on their tail.

Its every bit as majestic and great as it has been before.The Lion King Mufasa (James Earl Jones) just had a baby cub named Simba. All of the animals come to the ceremony, except for Mufasa's brother Scar (Jeremy Irons). Scar desperately wants to be King, but can't. As long as Mufasa and Simba are there. Soon Simba is able to walk and talk and is voiced by Jonathon Taylor Thomas. After hearing about an elephant graveyard from Scar, he and his friend Nala (Niketa Calame) visit it. They meet three bumbling hyenas Banzai (Cheech Marin), Shenzi (Whoopi Goldberg), and Ed (Jim Cummings), but they manage to leave unhurt. Scar is upset that the hyenas didn't do the job, so he orders a stampede to wipe out both of them, but it only takes care of Mufasa. Scar convinces Simba that he killed Mufasa, not Scar. So Simba flees into exile.The Lion King really benefits from the larger screen. Its lavish landscapes will be able to capture you more, and you can really savor the animation. Disney didn't need any humans, so they could spend all of the time on a great story and lush landscapes. In fact, its camera movement was so majestic that you actually felt like you were part of the pride of lions.The music boomed and really created the atmosphere. Although I had seen this picture before, I still was tense because of the way the music played out. Most of the time, I would just roll my eyes at the attempt to make me nervous. But Hans Zimmer's music really bowled me over and made my heart do calisthenics. Unlike such new Disney pics like Lilo and Stitch, the songs actually did some good. They took you out of a somewhat dreary mood and put a smile on your face and made your feet want to tap along. There were only a few, but they were very entertaining. And the Circle of Life song at the beginning was beautiful, with its perfect pictures and perfect sound.I really like James Earl Jones (he's pretty diverse), and this time was no exception. He seemed to act like he didn't want to do this role, but he couldn't contain his excitement for wanting to do voice-overs again (he had done some work in The Simpsons before).

Its every bit as majestic and great as it has been before.The Lion King Mufasa (James Earl Jones) just had a baby cub named Simba. All of the animals come to the ceremony, except for Mufasa's brother Scar (Jeremy Irons). Scar desperately wants to be King, but can't. As long as Mufasa and Simba are there. Soon Simba is able to walk and talk and is voiced by Jonathon Taylor Thomas. After hearing about an elephant graveyard from Scar, he and his friend Nala (Niketa Calame) visit it. They meet three bumbling hyenas Banzai (Cheech Marin), Shenzi (Whoopi Goldberg), and Ed (Jim Cummings), but they manage to leave unhurt. Scar is upset that the hyenas didn't do the job, so he orders a stampede to wipe out both of them, but it only takes care of Mufasa. Scar convinces Simba that he killed Mufasa, not Scar. So Simba flees into exile.The Lion King really benefits from the larger screen. Its lavish landscapes will be able to capture you more, and you can really savor the animation. Disney didn't need any humans, so they could spend all of the time on a great story and lush landscapes. In fact, its camera movement was so majestic that you actually felt like you were part of the pride of lions.The music boomed and really created the atmosphere. Although I had seen this picture before, I still was tense because of the way the music played out. Most of the time, I would just roll my eyes at the attempt to make me nervous.

They took you out of a somewhat dreary mood and put a smile on your face and made your feet want to tap along. There were only a few, but they were very entertaining. And the Circle of Life song at the beginning was beautiful, with its perfect pictures and perfect sound.I really like James Earl Jones (he's pretty diverse), and this time was no exception.

This is the best Hitchcock chase movie and certainly one of his most enjoyable. I feel many are put of by the somewhat shaky production values and the age, which makes the film seem tremendously old (only five years before Rebecca?).  Coupled to this Robert Donat's hair and moustache does the film no favours.  Being a fan of older films and FILMs in general, I have no such worries.The film is better than North By Northwest I think.  Now I have watched the latter film 3-4 times since I believe in giving every film its deserved viewings, but I cannot shake the feeling it is somewhat overrated BUT BY JUST.  It is still an EXCELLENT film, but by no means up there with HIS best.  The 39 Steps is better, the story has better pacing, a wittier interchange between the 2 leads (and from the supporting characters - i.e. the 2 gentlemen in the train) and some subtler comedy substances.  Plus the fact the locations are moodier - London, and dark, misty Scotland!  The chemistry between the two leads is phenomenal much better than in North by Northwest, and yet, is based purely on the their mental and verbal interactions rather than their physical (incidently I found Madeleine Carroll very sexy even if, all she does is remove her stockings).There are also some great touches such as that famous sound cut to the roaring train when the first murder is discovered, and the chases on show. Although these set pieces are more brief and low key compared to his later films, they complement the story to no end.  They all fit in with the natural flow of the film as opposed to being flamboyant showpieces.  For me North by Northwest is a more glossier affair and is a great example of the stereotypical Hollywood romance including the long gazes, long kisses, and reliance on star charisma to give charisma.The 39 Steps is something special and deserves to be in the BFi's greatest list.  Certainly as good as the THIRD MAN (not as accomplished a piece in terms of cinematic art, but definitely more thrilling enjoyable).  While not as deep or psychologically complex as some of his other works - for pure entertainment, atmosphere and storytelling its hard to beat.  After all, Mr Hitchcock was always primarily in it for good, intelligent entertainment fused with creative art  - he never cared much for the pretension and pointless symbolism that most yearn for (that is why I like his work so much), and certainly the amount of interest and exhaustive examination into who Mr Hitchcock was, is utterly pointless - people need to spend more time watching his films, rather than partaking in pointless exercises.Some may argue that the film COMPLETELY skimps over the criminal elements of the story, NEVER elaborating on details, or the motivation of the crime perpetrators (they are very much relegated to the shadow), but I prefer it this way since mystery and intrigue is built up and  and the picture is devoid of all the (intrusive?) talky, exposition evident in his later works. Instead Mr Hitchcock focuses on his two leads, letting them light up the screen.The 39 Steps is certainly up there with Rear Window, Vertigo, Notorious, Man Who Knew Too Much etc.. as his best work and still better than accomplished chase pictures such Minority Report and Mission Impossible which come out today.  A five star film - must see for all art fanatics.PS the similarities of this film to 1942s Saboteur (an underrated Hitchcock movie) are extraordinary, if it were not for the fact that both films are made by him it would be plagiarism.  Similarities extend to the device with the handcuffs, the somewhat feisty and hysterical blonde, journeys to the middle of nowhere to confront the mastermind, and the way the main protagonist is helped by locals who are all too quick to place faith in believing him.

Being a fan of older films and FILMs in general, I have no such worries.The film is better than North By Northwest I think.  Now I have watched the latter film 3-4 times since I believe in giving every film its deserved viewings, but I cannot shake the feeling it is somewhat overrated BUT BY JUST.  It is still an EXCELLENT film, but by no means up there with HIS best.  The 39 Steps is better, the story has better pacing, a wittier interchange between the 2 leads (and from the supporting characters - i.e. the 2 gentlemen in the train) and some subtler comedy substances.  Plus the fact the locations are moodier - London, and dark, misty Scotland!  The chemistry between the two leads is phenomenal much better than in North by Northwest, and yet, is based purely on the their mental and verbal interactions rather than their physical (incidently I found Madeleine Carroll very sexy even if, all she does is remove her stockings).There are also some great touches such as that famous sound cut to the roaring train when the first murder is discovered, and the chases on show. Although these set pieces are more brief and low key compared to his later films, they complement the story to no end.  They all fit in with the natural flow of the film as opposed to being flamboyant showpieces.  For me North by Northwest is a more glossier affair and is a great example of the stereotypical Hollywood romance including the long gazes, long kisses, and reliance on star charisma to give charisma.The 39 Steps is something special and deserves to be in the BFi's greatest list.  Certainly as good as the THIRD MAN (not as accomplished a piece in terms of cinematic art, but definitely more thrilling enjoyable).  While not as deep or psychologically complex as some of his other works - for pure entertainment, atmosphere and storytelling its hard to beat.  After all, Mr Hitchcock was always primarily in it for good, intelligent entertainment fused with creative art  - he never cared much for the pretension and pointless symbolism that most yearn for (that is why I like his work so much), and certainly the amount of interest and exhaustive examination into who Mr Hitchcock was, is utterly pointless - people need to spend more time watching his films, rather than partaking in pointless exercises.Some may argue that the film COMPLETELY skimps over the criminal elements of the story, NEVER elaborating on details, or the motivation of the crime perpetrators (they are very much relegated to the shadow), but I prefer it this way since mystery and intrigue is built up and  and the picture is devoid of all the (intrusive?) talky, exposition evident in his later works. Instead Mr Hitchcock focuses on his two leads, letting them light up the screen.The 39 Steps is certainly up there with Rear Window, Vertigo, Notorious, Man Who Knew Too Much etc.. as his best work and still better than accomplished chase pictures such Minority Report and Mission Impossible which come out today.  A five star film - must see for all art fanatics.PS the similarities of this film to 1942s Saboteur (an underrated Hitchcock movie) are extraordinary, if it were not for the fact that both films are made by him it would be plagiarism.

I must say, Disney has marketed Lilo and Stitch out to be a light, happy, cute little buddy picture between a little girl and an alien.  However, from it's 10 minute intro to it's aerial final it is as deeply developed, exciting and intelligent as something it's brilliant sibling company Pixar might create.  See, Stitch is actually a genetically engineered beast designed by a evil genius alien to be a destruction machine.  When he escapes to the water covered planet of Earth (the aliens at one point have a funny phonetic way of pronouncing out planet) he poses as a household pet (or attempts to anyway despite his destructive urges) to evade capture by two aliens who have followed him. As fascinating and engaging as Stitch is the movie really takes off when it puts my biggest fears to rest that Lilo would be a typical cute Disney kid playing the straight man to Stitch.  She is anything but.  An angry, imaginative, slightly disturbed child she has endured the loss of her parents (the movie never explains what actually happened to them) and was forced to grow up beyond her years.  The movie contains a shouting match between Lilo and her sister that is so brutally honest it actually shocked me to see it in this type of movie.  I mean I've always known that Disney movies were more intelligent and adult than the Dreamworks stuff (Shrek...gag), but Lilo & Stitch take it up to another level.  It's strange to see the serious drama of the increasingly disastrous child custody battle going on parallel to the loony exploits of the two aliens hunting down Stitch.  The movie is one of the most well written of the Disney movies to date.  It looks great (yes, even with hand drawn animation) and the music is gorgeous and perfectly suited.    This movie could be lumped with The Emperor's New Groove in the sense that both are part of this New Disney trend that seems to be moving away from the musical numbers, sappy morals and annoying sidekicks.  Let's hope anyway.  (My scale has rated Groove slightly higher.  This reflects a kind of bias in it explained like this Groove is a movie that is straight comedy, it's aim is narrow, but what it does it does to near perfection. Stitch, aims a little wider and is richer and more complex.  It doesn't get everything to near perfection ,but It juggles more, and does it  VERY well making it- I think- in many ways a better movie.)  Both crackle with originality and pure bombastic imagination.  There are many moments here- from it's ugly aliens to fast-paced action scenes- where Lilo and Stitch seems to be trying to out-weird Groove.  Stitch driving a gasoline truck into a volcano is a great moment.  Both also prove that Disney is still the king of animation.  Another must-see!
