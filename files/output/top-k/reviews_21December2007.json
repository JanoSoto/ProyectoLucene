Aided by a CIA operative (Bening) and his own team of agents he tries to resolve the situation in a sound and lawful manner, but when the U.S. Army (led by tyrannical general Willis) take over and declare martial law, it leads to an outbreak of fear, discrimination, and hostility against innocent Arab-American citizens.

Although some of the soundtrack seems to have aged not quite gracefully much of it is haunting. The Bounty is a well done movie based on The Mutiny on the Bounty tale\/accounts over 200 years ago. The costuming and ship were pretty convincing, and there seems to be some attention to detail of Older British Navy Protocols during the tail end of the age of discovery and trade. Photography and effects are well made as well. By far the best performance is by Anthony Hopkins (quite a bit younger of course) who's Blithe seems determined but later paranoid of his social surroundings and his heavy hand of authority with his crew. He enthralls with vigor as a salty sea- dog captain. Mel Gibson is well cast as a troubled younger man who doesn't quite agree with the tactlessness of his captain. Gibson turns in a good performance, perhaps a bit subdued. (spoilers) They, together with some other familiar European actors meet some of the usual at sea problems that we've seen in other films. And of course later there's the requisite romance with islander savages. Perhaps more enjoyable than the mutiny itself is the survival of the smaller skiff, with the thrown out but spirited captain and company surviving through high spirits. One of the best scenes in the movie involves the Hopkins character donating his food rations to disheartened enlisted. Of note, Lawarence Olivier throws some added weight in a cameo type for good measure. Done imo during a great time of movie making - early to mid-Eighties, catch The Bounty especially if you like Vangelis or at-sea adventures.
