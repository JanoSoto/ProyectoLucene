I think it's always heartbreaking to say the least, when you have to part ways with someone whom you feel an immense connection with. Be it after a single date of the evening, and definitely when the separation is going to be longer. And Richard Linklater has encapsulated this feeling in Before Sunrise perfectly.11 years is a long time, and that's exactly how old this movie is, but it never felt dated as I watched it for the very first time today. I too have heard about the premise, and wondered whether it would be possible to try and do what they did. No such luck P But romanticism doesn't die, and I think I'm still holding on to that sliver of hope to be swept and sweep someone off their feet in the same manner, under mutually attractive circumstances, exploring a new city without any plan whatsoever on what will happen. Junk plans, order, and processes, and just welcome and embrace the unknown, together with a special someone.It's all about moments, and the seizing of chances as they come along. This movie is dialogue laden, but it doesn't bore. The characters discuss a vast range of topics, from their fears, family, their past relationships, and of course, love. They flirt with each other through an overnight stay in Vienna, Austria, all the while conscious that their impromptu and spontaneous decision to join each other in a night about town, will have to end come the next morning, with each going about their separate ways. It's easy to exploit the film and turn it into a Visit Austria commercial, and I'm glad that it didn't. Rather, having it serve as a backdrop to an intense, short relationship worked wonders both ways. The performances by Ethan Hawke (as the American Jesse) and Julie Delpjy (as French student Celine) are top notch, and would have you believe right away that these are two lovebirds falling in love with each other in the early stages of their relationship. I believed.However, despite the upbeat premise about love, the movie somehow had this sense of gloom hanging over it, and it is uncomfortable, though the feeling's made lighter by the lovers having great conversation, and having a great time hanging out. They don't skirt unhappy issues either, as past relationships which didn't worked were discussed, and that too struck a chord within me, especially Jesse's recollection of what happened just before he boarded the train, the bit about how little others have thought about you. Definite ouch in my direction.There are many beautiful moments in the movie, but my absolute love is the one where the couple enters a listening booth to sample a vinyl. Everything there is to say about love, just happened to be captured so succinctly. Despite being a talkie movie, there is totally no need for any dialogue. The stealing of glances of each other, is done to perfection, it just brings back any memories you have of yourself stealing glances at your other half. Everything about this scene is perfect, and I can rave about it till the cows come home. Simply amazing, and you have to see it to believe! This scene alone will justify watching the movie!This movie is so damn good, I just wanna watch it again, before I pop the sequel into the DVD player. Watch this! And it goes into my list of all time favourites!Warner Bros Code 3 DVD contains no extras, save for the theatrical trailer. Which is kind of disappointing. Visual and audio transfers are great though, with 4 different subtitles to choose from, and scene selection features.

ROCKY is a legend given form in the shape of the biggest most satisfying, inspiring! Or simply&#x85; THE GREATEST MOVIE EVER MADE!Rocky is quite simply one of the best movies ever made. A good movie for me is one that does not end with the credits, and Rocky certainly stays with you long after the final credits have rolled.Plot In A Paragraph Rocky Balboa, (Sylvester Stallone) a small-time boxer gets a chance to fight the heavy-weight champion of the world Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), in a contest in which he aims to go the distance. If there is anything to complain about (and this really is nitpicking) it's all the empty seats during the fight, but that really is nitpicking of the highest order!! The story is filled with the standard elements, but the movie is anything but standard. It's a love story, but set in the run up to a boxing match. It's a movie that leads to a boxing match, but the outcome of the fight is secondary to the characters reactions to what just happened. It's got friendship, second chances, people who hate for no reason and the greatest underdog story ever told. I can't praise the cast enough of this movie enough here. Sylvester Stallone, who has contributed some tough fisted, hard as nails characters over the years, is perfectly cast as the title character, he should be, it's well known he wrote the role for himself. Burgess Meredith is always reliable, but here he is truly awesome. Talia Shire is also awesome as the shy Adrian. Burt Young and Joe Spinell deserve praise for their performances too, as does Carl Weathers for his turn as Rocky's opponent Apollo Creed. Tony Burton does well with what he has too. Favourite scenes (outside of the training and the fight) for me are Rocky and Adrian's first date and the I should have broke your thumbs scene. I also like a scene were Rocky's boss gives him $500 for training expenses too. All this and I've not even mentioned the music. Bill Conti's score is absolute perfection. If I can't go in the ocean without hearing John Williams score for Jaws going through my head, I can't go for a workout or jog without hearing Conti's Gonna Fly Now but it's not just the inspiration trainin music that is great, check out 'First Date' on the soundtrack. Superb. I was recently privileged enough to run the Rocky steps with my two kids and Philladelphia's number one Rocky impersonator Mike Kunda. You can't have any idea what it meant to me to do that!! He also took us on a tour of the movies filming sites. It was great going round seeing all the sights from this movie. This is basically a fairytale story in a different setting and feels very real. and at the heart of the movie is the greatest love story in the history of motion picture. thats right better than Jack and Rose in Titanic and better than Ryan O Neil and Ali McGraw in Love Story. here are two people totally devoted to each other and stay that way through six moviesThe script by Stallone is exceptionally good and completely deserved the Oscar. Rocky is a treasure of a character and Stallone plays him to perfection, he really should have picked up an Oscar for that as well.All in All Rocky is a highly professional piece of work, with a good sense of heart and atmosphere it makes for perfect entertainment.

In the end, I was a little disappointed with the film, as it's touted as a great film. The film I saw was a good film, but certainly lacked that little oomph necessary to take it to great.But there was a lot about it that I liked. The casting\/acting continually surprised me throughout the film. The characters are all a little... angular, but despite that, the performances are quite good and one of the highlights of the film. Indeed, despite seeing his name boldly credited, I completely forgot that Frank Sinatra was playing the lead character in the film. The story itself is nice too, complete with a few twists to keep things interesting. I even liked the dialogue writing.But I don't feel like all the components were strong. In particular, I felt like the overall direction of the film was a little stale. I often felt like everything I was watching was set up in front of me, rather than flowing naturally. Okay, that's a little vague, but the directing choices, including framing, mis-en-scene and the editing just kept things seeming just a touch artificial. The story, I can tell, is trying to go for paranoia, but the because there is little that's hidden from the audience, it ends up being a drama until the end, where a little suspense comes in. But since the film mood is that of suspense, it's hard to say whether the film really managed to get the whole thing right.I certainly wasn't convinced and halfway through the movie, I started getting fairly bored. It's not that stuff doesn't happen, but that the drama wasn't fully there. And then I had to keep wondering whether or not Janet Leigh's character had any significance to the film, because she seems a little like an afterthought. I would've excised her character entirely from the story, since she has no impact on the main characters.But I did finish it and the few twists that the film has were interesting enough to keep me from giving up on the film. That and I was still impressed by the underlying story as well as the acting. I just wish it were all presented better.

My older cousin and her boyfriend took me to the Mall to watch a movie. Back then I wasn't going very often to the cinema, due to the fact that my parents didn't have time and I wasn't old enough to go alone to any theater. The movie captivated my attention like nothing before and I became so interested in anything that had to do with this movie, and I heard that it was made after a book. I didn't had Internet back then, but I found the first book at a library and convinced my mother to buy it.

However, this being said, he's made a lot of films and I've seen just a few. In my minds eye I am keeping the images of his performance here and the one in The Thin Red Line. Nolte has a a full range of acting talents. When it's necessary to shout he roars like a wounded lion. His best moments are the ones I treasure in actors when he just emotes through facial, hand and body gestures, without saying anything. Having come to the conclusion that our present generation of actors, by and large, have no appreciation of what an actor can do without speaking, having no conscious appreciation of the mastery of Keaton and Chaplin, this generation of actors relies far too much on the mechanical wizardry of computers. Of course it is also just a sign of the times we live in. Had Chaplin lived in our times....who knows, he just might as well have become an aficionado of CGI tools.I have not read the Vonnegut novel from which this film comes to the screen. However, the plot is not so far fetched or convoluted that we cannot follow the path laid, even with all its surprises. Of course on the outset it appears preposterous. However, it is also not impossible.Consider these for starters A Spy at the Heart of the Third Reich He Extraordinary Life of Fritz Kolbe, America's Most Important Spy in World War II by Delattre and Prichard (look at Amazon for more details). Consider History Undercover Piercing the Reich American Spies Inside Nazi Germany DVD (I saw this here http\/\/store.aetv.com\/html\/product\/index.jhtml?id=75054) seems to be a History Channel production.So, is the story ridiculous? Far fetched yes, impossible, no. Back to the plot. Nolte's character is recruited and accepts an impossibly dangerous mission and unfortunately the script does not give us an adequate reason why he accepts. Was it a type of passivity, that he got sucked into this role as it says because it was the best story he had ever written and he got to play the part? That's a hard thing to imagine any of us would grasp. But, it was an unusual time and people did extraordinary things.The acting throughout the film by the entire cast is excellent and as people have pointed out Alan Arkin, always fantastic, is very good in a small role.I was really shocked by the ending of the film (no - I won't spoil it) and it made me feel terrible about the choice. Did this person feel that the road was finally over and that he had spoken all that was necessary and that any more would be chapters added to a life already filled with many burnt pages? Hard to say but it really jolts.Nolte gives one of the finest performances you can expect....the premises of the film make you wonder about a lot of things. It's very entertaining and provoking.

The book was very detailed & fairly intense, so when I saw the movie, I was somewhat disappointed to see the truth in the statement that Movies are Never as Good as the Actual Book Still it was an okay movie, though nothing very great or special.When I first saw this movie, I was still growing up & I thought it was a better movie than I do now, even though I have not seen it again recently, so this opinion is in retrospect.In my opinion, there was a LOT of room for improvement in this movie.First of all, I don't think that Sally Field was a good casting choice for the role of Betty Mahmoody. In this movie, like in some of her other work, Sally majorly overacts, making this particular character come off as a spoiled, whiny, elitist American & precisely the what those in the Middle East & elsewhere in the world detest about America.Now, Alfred Molina, who played Betty's husband Moody, acted very well, but he too was a wrong casting for the role, because he is nothing like the real-life Moody, either in stature, size or appearance, giving viewers a wrong idea of the differences between Betty & Moody. As a result, in the movie, the situation was manipulated and exaggerated towards Betty's point of view, so that viewers will automatically support her, when in reality, there are two sides to every story, including this one - the other side which has not been shown until recently.When I first saw the movie, I was still in my preteens. Because of that I was still somewhat naïve & believed most things, without always verifying it for accuracy and factual basis.So when I read the book, and saw the movie, I immediately believed that what Betty claimed in the book & movie really happened, and I never bothered to question it.Even though a Iranian friend who watched the movie with me one time, said life was not really like that in Iran, and that most Iranian people did not act like that, I was unsure.Then recently, I started Googling, and researching, about Betty Mahmoody. Because her daughter, Mahtob, is just a year or so younger than me and they're originally from the general area that I lived\/live in, I felt a sort of connection, and was interested in where they were\/are and what's been happening with them, in the years since the movie came out.So I started researching them, and what I found out was eye-opening, and has made me question the truth of the very foundation of the movie and book.First of all, in the book and movie, Moody is portrayed to be this big, strong, powerful guy who physically attacked his wife, Betty and daughter, Mahtob often to the point of injury.In reality, Moody, is a fairly short (smaller than Betty!) soft-spoken guy, who looks like he couldn't harm a flea (and even if he did, couldn't hurt him much!) Betty is nearly double the size\/strength of this man, and there is no way that he could physically attack her in any way that could cause the harm that she has described in her book, and movie.Betty's husband Moody, has recently come out with a film of his own side of the story, that was produced by a Swiss production company.In the movie (which I've seen several clips) that shows him as the soft-spoken, gentle, kind man that he probably is who just loves and misses his daughter.Furthermore, Moody has NUMEROUS witnesses, including friends of Betty's, both in Iran AND in America who state that Betty had agreed to relocate to Iran with her husband and daughter willingly, and that she had been given the option of returning to the US anytime, both with and without her daughter Mahtob.I think Betty Mahmoody is just a bitter, spoiled rich American woman, who went to Iran willingly with her husband and daughter, thinking that she would have all the creature comforts available to her in America, and when she found out otherwise, instead of just coming home where she would have to work for her own living, she instead stayed in Iran, so she could be supported by her husband, and live off his money, in relative luxury (read the description in her book of the HUGE mansion as well as the lavish jewelry and clothes that Moody bought her and Mahtob in Iran) Then when her husband asked her to return to America to liquidate their assets so he could have the funds to support her in her exorbitant Americanized lifestyle, she got mad, and ran away, taking their daughter with her.So she turned Mahtob against her father and she came back to the US. But without her sugar daddy around to support her, she found another get-rich-quick scheme by selling the rights to her story.She just played up her role as the poor American woman oppressed by the big mean old brute Iranian husband and government, which the US media just ate up, even in the pre 9\/11 world. So by playing victim, Betty has gotten books published and a movie out of the deal which I'm sure has her just about rolling in the bucks now.Meanwhile Moody is an aging, frail, sickly, and lonely, pitiful man who just wants to see his daughter again before he dies. Yet because Betty has brainwashed Mahtob into thinking her father is a cruel, controlling, and violent man, Mahtob and her dad have yet to reunite after years of separation and estrangement.Way to go, Betty Mahmoody. Nice job at destroying your daughter's relationship with her dad over money!

While RoboCop was supposed to be the star, John Lithgow really stole the show. And, all those people who worked for Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems with the name John (that was just too funny - imho). This is a movie I had to watch more that once to get all of the subtle plot details and twists. But every time I watch it, I say that this is one of my favorite movies of all time! And, all those fabulous moments - conference room - and no matter where you go there you are! Peace!

The film covers Ali's first world pro heavyweight title fight against Sonny Liston in '64 and ends in The Rumble in the Jungle against Foreman in '74, with the Vietnam controversy in the middle. Turbulent times which the director Michael Mann unsuccessfully portrays.Some reviewers here have applauded Will Smith's portrayal of the charismatic, dynamic and quick-thinking boxer. I can't say Will Smith did a bad job, but the film worked against his efforts. The film has too many characters, and too many characters without personality. When you place the world champion boxer side to side with other icons like Malcolm X, Don King, Howard Cosell and Martin Luther King some personality description has to give. Unfortunately it turned out to be all the protagonists lost - at times Mohammad Ali the person was no more than a lackluster cut-out figure around which the other icons of the time revolved.The cinematography was sombre, dark and lethargic. The musical score is similarly a heavy-handed monotonous base, indicating a misplaced mood of impending doom (!). The director Michael Mann has used this type of scoring to great effect in films like Manhunter (1986) and Heat (1995) - here it simply is formulaic and confusing. OK so the director wanted to describe a dark period in American history with race riots and the assassinations of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King but this was never fully explored. There is also a lack of emphasis on boxing in the film, which would be OK if it was replaced with a new and interesting point-of-view, but here it just was sacrificed to no end.It's hard for me to recommend this film to anyone. Someone new to Ali's greatness would never get it from the movie. Someone who has more than a fleeting acquaintance with Ali's life will be confused by how the period of 1968-1974 is misrepresented.I have to agree with director Spike Lee's comment - how can it be possible to make a boring movie about one of the most exciting figures of the 20th century?

Apparently a lot of this footage has been lost for over 20 years and there is some good stuff, good performances by James Brown and of course a lot of Ali talking his jive and poetry, and some of it is pretty good yesterday I hospitalized a brick, i'm so mean I make medicine sick. Ali is mesmerizing, I was born in 1970 so I missed the whole Ali phenom, he was just a vague idea of somebody important, like Evel Knievel and Farah Fawcett. Lately I've become very interested in this guy, I guess because the legend has passed and Ali is more of a distant memory, the hype has died down and you can study the real man. I think a lot of the sports writers at the time had a romanticized view of boxing, it is not a pleasant sport, it's too men beating the hell out of each other. Now there is some skill involved and Ali proved that you can win brains and will power as well as brawn, but they seemed almost amazed that a black man would stand up and say he was the greatest, and when he said that you knew he meant of EVERYBODY, black or white. I think that's what annoyed them the most, he wasn't the quiet humble lap dog they wanted from a black athlete who just did his job, thanked everyone and shut the hell up.Sorry, my reviews tend to wander. Ali truly showed has smart he was and Foreman was oblivious to how he was being played. Ali realized during his build up to the Norton fight that having a psychological edge was as important as a physical one. Telling everyone you're the greatest has two effects, if builds yourself up and it frustrates your opponent. It's one thing to see a man boast that he's a scientist, it's another thing to see him actually deliver on the promise, and it is a wondrous thing to behold. Also, the fact that monsoon rains held off until 20 minutes after the fight finished, what a story! My major complaint with this film is that there a lot of Norman Mailer telling slightly exaggerated tales of the fight and Plimpton pompous pontificating (two men who probably never got into a fight their whole lives) but very little of the actual fight. Did they lose some footage? I would have liked to have seen some more rounds of Ali getting pounded on. I'm amazed he could take that punishment, considering what Foreman did to the punching bag. But in the end he fell right into Ali's trap and the fight ended in one of the biggest upsets in boxing history.

Also, the fact that monsoon rains held off until 20 minutes after the fight finished, what a story! My major complaint with this film is that there a lot of Norman Mailer telling slightly exaggerated tales of the fight and Plimpton pompous pontificating (two men who probably never got into a fight their whole lives) but very little of the actual fight. Did they lose some footage? I would have liked to have seen some more rounds of Ali getting pounded on. I'm amazed he could take that punishment, considering what Foreman did to the punching bag. But in the end he fell right into Ali's trap and the fight ended in one of the biggest upsets in boxing history. ","genre":"Documentary, History, Sport"},{"date":"2 January 2007","score":"","review":" This is a pretty documentary of the legendary fight between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman in 1974. Apparently a lot of this footage has been lost for over 20 years and there is some good stuff, good performances by James Brown and of course a lot of Ali talking his jive and poetry, and some of it is pretty good yesterday I hospitalized a brick, i'm so mean I make medicine sick. Ali is mesmerizing, I was born in 1970 so I missed the whole Ali phenom, he was just a vague idea of somebody important, like Evel Knievel and Farah Fawcett. Lately I've become very interested in this guy, I guess because the legend has passed and Ali is more of a distant memory, the hype has died down and you can study the real man. I think a lot of the sports writers at the time had a romanticized view of boxing, it is not a pleasant sport, it's too men beating the hell out of each other. Now there is some skill involved and Ali proved that you can win brains and will power as well as brawn, but they seemed almost amazed that a black man would stand up and say he was the greatest, and when he said that you knew he meant of EVERYBODY, black or white. I think that's what annoyed them the most, he wasn't the quiet humble lap dog they wanted from a black athlete who just did his job, thanked everyone and shut the hell up.Sorry, my reviews tend to wander. Ali truly showed has smart he was and Foreman was oblivious to how he was being played. Ali realized during his build up to the Norton fight that having a psychological edge was as important as a physical one.

Besides providing us with good performances, original plot, fantastic special effects, thoughtful messages and a lot more, it was an, until then, completely unseen world to the public. This is the first sci-fi movie that takes us out into the unknown space of our galaxy with such splendid effects and mind bursting reality that the audience is left without words. I am only 16 years old, and therefore I was raised into a world of modern effects and 3D animations in the movies. But nonetheless I was really, and I mean completely, blown away by the quality of these effects, even after almost 40 years. The visual effects was just one of the merits of this movie, the camera was in true Kubrick style amazing and enchanting. It feels like you are consumed by the screen and sucked into this surreal world (especially in the round control room or whatever you call it). The effects, the camera and the sheer size of this movie caught me of my guards even though I had seen the rating before I bought it. But this movie has more to it than this. The meaning of this movie can also be interpreted as you wish yourself, even though I think there are some clear points concerning humanity (also true Kubrick style). How humanity on top of its evolution is just maintenance on board, and therefore not needed by the computer, one of humanities tools. How we in space appear like babies, learning to walk once more, losing control of our tools in zero-gravity, breathing through equipment as fish out of water. On the peak of evolution, we set out into the never-ending adventure as simple primates. Many might think that the length and slow pace of this movie is, boring? ridicules? or just a waste of time. But before you can jump to those conclusions, think about why Kubrick spends time with calm music and a spaceship in the middle of space for several minutes. This is to illustrate the beauty of it. Beauty, beauty is in many cases not granted the rightful respect by viewers. Kubrick wants to show us beauty, and if we do not succumb to it and relax, we can not enjoy this film as it was intended. This is not an ordinary movie, we can not just sit and watch as we can with some other movies, this requires time, thoughts and above all commitment and feelings to watch. All of this together, makes this one of the greatest achievements in the world of moving pictures. 10\/10 Let me know if you agree with me.

What a waste. Script was soooo dumb, I almost threw up. Direction was terrible. Casting even worse. Megan Edwards, not very bright, doesn't know what's going on around her and spends the last 20 minutes of the movie walking around in slow motion. Maybe that's where her head was most of the time. I burst out laughing when she suddenly turns the car around after getting away from our villain, and heads back. Smart. No calling police, nothing but walking around in a dark house, that's right lights went out and phone didn't work. Surprise, surprise. It was the slow motion that got me. She moved like in a trance with no expression on her face. Please Kurt Voss, director, teach her how to act. Then there's the father, played on one level by Michael Des Burres, who also succumbs to the tramp even though he didn't want to. Please, she's not that attractive. Overly made up, with too much lip gloss, and obvious acting, I felt she was the worst in the picture and believe me the others were bad.Anyway the father ends up in a garage with the car running while our little girl, Megan, is wandering around the house looking for everybody. You never know if she ever got to her father. In the end she just leaves the house. Another stupid move on the writer's part, Karen Kelly. There's Greg Vaughan as the boy friend who isn't too swift. Sort of just let's himself be done in. The only redeemable character is the housekeeper, played by Susan Tyrell. At least she had doubts about our little Jamie. Unfortunately she wasn't smart enough to know better.This is among the worse films ever. And I've seen a lot of bad films. How do they get produced? At least the first POISON IVY had the presence of Drew Barrymore and Sara Gilbert in the roles. Don't waste your time or money on this.
