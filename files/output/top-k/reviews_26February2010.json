Before renting it the other day, I thought it was released in 1935, but it turns out that's another werewolf movie, entitled Werewolf of London, which I've yet to see. By the time I finally watched The Wolf Man just last night, I knew this film was actually released in 1941. I haven't seen most of the old Universal horror movies, but had seen several of them from different decades by the time I saw this one, and most of them had been good. Before watching it, I knew this 1941 release was not the most highly regarded film from the Universal horror years, but still highly praised, so my expectations were reasonably high, and they were basically met.After the death of his brother, Larry Talbot returns to his ancestral home, a castle in Wales, where his father, Sir John Talbot lives. Shortly after arriving, he sees a young woman named Gwen Conliffe, who runs an antique shop in town. He buys a silver headed cane with a wolf-shaped head from her store, and is told that it represents the werewolf, a human being who sometimes transforms into a wolf. That night, Larry goes out with Gwen, who brings along her friend, Jenny. They come to a gypsy camp to have their fortunes told. Shortly after meeting a gypsy named Bela, Jenny is found by Larry in the forest, being attacked by what appears a wolf! Larry fights and kills this wolf with his cane, but is badly bitten during the fight and Jenny has not survived the attack! When police investigate, they find Jenny's body, but don't find a wolf's body nearby. Instead, they find the body of Bela, and it appears that he was the wolf! Now that Larry has been bitten by a werewolf, he might be one himself! After the film starts, it isn't very long before Larry sees Gwen through a telescope and immediately goes over to her store, telling her he's psychic. He falls in love with her just from finding her with the telescope. Scenes like this show that the romantic aspect of the film definitely could have been done better and probably certain other aspects could have as well, though I still was intrigued during this early store scene for some reason. However, with horror movies like this, viewers obviously expect tension, and there's a lot of that in The Wolf Man to help make most of it entertaining. The film also has some very good visuals for its time, especially in the mist-enshrouded forest scenes. The only film I had seen Lon Chaney Jr. in before this one was the first Of Mice and Men adaptation, but his performances in both of these films didn't let me down, and I'm convinced he was a talented actor. Most of the acting in this 1941 Universal horror movie is good, even if not everyone in the cast can match Chaney. It's been nearly seventy years since the release of The Wolf Man, but if you're into old black and white movies and want a memorable adrenaline rush, this could certainly be a good choice.

Jackie Brown has everything going for it, including a straight up crime plot with some great, logical twists. The woman playing Jackie Brown is Pam Grier, the real deal, famous for early 1970s blaxploitation films, and of course included not only for her great presence, but for her ties to the scene the Tarantino was trying to recreate.Then there is Robert Forster, as amazing as Samuel Jackson, and with a more difficult part (playing a bondsman who is lowkey and subtle, next to Jackson's bad guy cool guy gunrunner). The two cops (including Michael Keaton) are great, and Robert De Niro has a small, steady role as well. If there is any one weak actor it's Bridget Fonda, and her role is to be exactly the kind of shallow, selfish person she portrays, so maybe that works, too. Does the movie transport you and sweep you in? Absolutely. Do you care about what happens to all these believable characters? Not entirely, but mostly.

Probably had something to do with the fact it was rather violent and had good action scenes. Still, I even liked the parts of the movie that had little action as the ending to this one was rather emotionally powerful. How Mel Gibson did not win an academy award for acting is beyond me as he did just as good a job or even better (in fact I say better) than Russell Crowe would do in the movie Gladiator. Still, he got best director and best picture during the days when he was not crazy (or the days when he hid it better). This film tells the tale of Wallace a man who tried to break Scotland free of English rule back in the days. Why did he begin this crusade, well this is established in a early scene where Wallace's new wife is killed by the British guy in charge of the area. Well William Wallace quickly gets his revenge and soon begins his quest of trying to liberate Scotland from the Brits. You have a couple of rather good action scenes that involve the standard arrow attacks and the charge of two factions. Very well done and there is a bit of humor to this one as well. The movie though is not all action as we get to learn of things about the king who rules England and his son who is married to a very beautiful lady, but for some reason he does not seem to care for her much 'wink'. The final scenes of William Wallace are very emotionally charged and powerful and despite a somewhat sad fate for the main character, the film ends with one final charge. In the end a grand movie that I am always surprised did not make more money than it did as it did not even break the 100 million dollar barrier despite being a very good film.

Soon the wife finds herself pregnant but fears start to slip in that her eccentric neighbors might be trying to do her and the baby harm. She finds out that they could be part of a coven of witches and that they might just be needing the baby for evil deeds. I'm not one who thinks this is a flawless movie as I do have a couple issues with Polanski's screenplay but there's no question that the film contains a certain cold atmosphere and some great performances that make it worth viewing. I think the real key to the film's success is the direction by Polanski because he perfectly blends all the elements and really makes a complete film. I love how the movie starts off with this sweet and innocent nature as if you were watching the happiest film in the world. These calm moments are handled perfectly by the director and he also manages to direct the darker scenes just as masterfully. The dream sequences are brilliantly done and some of them are extremely disturbing to watch. Polanski also handles the smaller, personal drama well and one of the best scenes in the movie happens when Rosemary is in the phone booth trying to find someone to help her. The way Polanski directs this sequence is flawless and Farrow really hits it out of the park and delivers the paranoia that the movie needs. Farrow is simply magnificent in her role as she nails every emotion that she has to play. I really found her chilling in her paranoia that someone is possibly trying to kill her kid. Cassavetes is also excellent even though I think one of the screenplay's major faults is how his character falls in with this group out of no where and the fact that his character comes off as a creepy from scene one. Supporting players Ruth Gordon, Sidney Blackmer, Ralph Bellamy, Maurice Evans and Patsy Kelly are extremely good as well. The disturbing nature of a child being harmed is something that has been attempted in many movies both before and after this one but the creepiness that Polanski brings to the subject is something that hasn't been matched.

Howitt has here a brilliant concept, but what to do with it? How to end it? Where to take it? Certainly the first time director has given himself a huge challenge with this movie of endless possibilities.Plot (or plots) concerns a young woman's two lives, each affected by a twist of fate that hinges on a split second. Helen is fired, and despondently heads for home, however she just misses her train, thus setting off a chain of events which see her almost mugged, hospitalised and home much later than she would have liked. Parallel story sees her making the train, getting home early and catching her boyfriend in bed with another woman. From here, Howitt is faced with his What to do? dilemma, much as the two Helens are in the film.Rather that carrying one story to its conclusion and then going back to give us the other, Howitt decides it would be better to allow his audience to compare Helen's two lives by running them simultaneously side by side. Problem is, our director keeps the two stories too similar, which makes comparison easy, but stretches the bounds of reality. Surely even the smallest event would change a person's life a whole lot more than this. Then comes the finale. How to close this thought provoking flick. Howitt again errs in ending both stories almost identically, and it was here that he lost me completely. He even manages to sneak in a happy ending, perhaps trying to suggest that this was the reality, and the other only the what if scenario.In short, Peter Howitt fails to do two things. He does not allow his movie to go off into two completely different tangents, giving us a much more believable script; he delivers a crowd pleasing closure, rather than endings that reflected the true nature of his stories. No real finale was required for either, just an indication of where our heroine was headed in each would have been fine. Howitt has sadly lacked the courage to be truly bold in this first event. Sure the general movie-going audience may not have been pleased, but the film would have been more true to its theme.Well, having thoroughly dissected Sliding Doors, you can see it certainly had me thinking. Of course the cast are the other side to this pic. Gwyneth Paltrow is suitable as Helen, the woman whose life takes two different paths thanks to the hand of fate. Most impressive is her English accent. Paltrow had me thoroughly convinced she was a Brit. Enjoyable in support are John Hannah as James the shoulder Helen finds to cry on in scenario two, and John Lynch as the philandering Gerry who is too weak to take control of his own life.

Certainly the first time director has given himself a huge challenge with this movie of endless possibilities.Plot (or plots) concerns a young woman's two lives, each affected by a twist of fate that hinges on a split second. Helen is fired, and despondently heads for home, however she just misses her train, thus setting off a chain of events which see her almost mugged, hospitalised and home much later than she would have liked. Parallel story sees her making the train, getting home early and catching her boyfriend in bed with another woman. From here, Howitt is faced with his What to do? dilemma, much as the two Helens are in the film.Rather that carrying one story to its conclusion and then going back to give us the other, Howitt decides it would be better to allow his audience to compare Helen's two lives by running them simultaneously side by side. Problem is, our director keeps the two stories too similar, which makes comparison easy, but stretches the bounds of reality. Surely even the smallest event would change a person's life a whole lot more than this. Then comes the finale. How to close this thought provoking flick. Howitt again errs in ending both stories almost identically, and it was here that he lost me completely. He even manages to sneak in a happy ending, perhaps trying to suggest that this was the reality, and the other only the what if scenario.In short, Peter Howitt fails to do two things. He does not allow his movie to go off into two completely different tangents, giving us a much more believable script; he delivers a crowd pleasing closure, rather than endings that reflected the true nature of his stories. No real finale was required for either, just an indication of where our heroine was headed in each would have been fine. Howitt has sadly lacked the courage to be truly bold in this first event. Sure the general movie-going audience may not have been pleased, but the film would have been more true to its theme.Well, having thoroughly dissected Sliding Doors, you can see it certainly had me thinking. Of course the cast are the other side to this pic. Gwyneth Paltrow is suitable as Helen, the woman whose life takes two different paths thanks to the hand of fate. Most impressive is her English accent. Paltrow had me thoroughly convinced she was a Brit. Enjoyable in support are John Hannah as James the shoulder Helen finds to cry on in scenario two, and John Lynch as the philandering Gerry who is too weak to take control of his own life.

In 1985, he was known mostly for his work in action\/adventure movies (in particular, of course, the Star Wars and Indiana Jones movies.) Aside from that he had done mostly guest work in TV series. Witness - although it has some action scenes - is about as far removed from an action\/adventure movie as you can get, and Ford pulled it off well. The movie is book-ended by a story about police corruption, as a young Amish boy (well played by Lukas Haas) witnesses the murder of an undercover police officer, and then identifies the killer as another cop. Ford's Det. John Book (an appropriately simple name) decides to root out the corruption, but then has to hide out in the boy's Amish community to protect both the boy and himself from the cops he's going after. A story about crooked cops is nothing really special, but the appeal of the movie is really this look at the inner workings of an Amish community.This is rather slow-paced, and while that's usually a criticism, in this case it fits the Amish setting perfectly. Book - taken in by the boy's family - has trouble adjusting, but develops an affection for the community - and, of course, for the boy's mother Rachel (Kelly McGillis), although their relationship is kept platonic. Throughout the movie you get a real sense of the tightness of the close-knit Amish community through such depictions as the barn-raising for a newly married couple and the entire community rushing to Eli's farm when the bell rings. The movie makes good use of what I would call low-key humour. It's never laugh out loud funny, but there are simple scenes, like old Eli waking Book up with the words 430 - time for milking! that you can't help but smile at. What I see as the inherent contradiction of Amish life is also shown here. They're a simple community, deliberately keeping everything simple to avoid any sense of pride, and yet by keeping themselves so simple they turn themselves into the centre of attention - a tourist trap for Lancaster County, Pennsylvania.

He's no cry baby though, in this story.At one level, this is a humdrum narrative a bright &#x96; perhaps gifted &#x96; young pianist, Robert 'Bobby' Dupea (Jack Nicholson) drifts around south-west USA enjoying a free and easy hedonistic lifestyle &#x96; all to avoid facing up to his roots and himself. He has a not-very-bright girl, Rayette Dipesto (Karen Black, in an acting performance as good as Nicholson's) who just loves him, and won't let go. So much so, Rayette simply becomes Rayette the Pest; he calls her Dipesto most of the time, anyway. And she becomes even more of a pest when Bobby finds out she's pregnant.So, he quits his job at an oilfield, goes to LA and finds out from his sister that his father has had two strokes, and is now mostly paralyzed. Grudgingly, he agrees to visit his father and, almost as grudgingly, takes Rayette with him. Embarrassed by Rayette's homespun, low-class upbringing, however, Bobby leaves her at a motel so as to see his family alone. There, he gets involved with his brother's fiancée, gets into a fight with his father's male nurse, tries to tell his mute father how he feels (in a remarkably poignant scene) and is forced, when Rayette shows up unannounced, to eventually defend her simple nature from the cutting remarks of a family acquaintance. Unable to face the family or his perceived failures any more, Bobby leaves with Rayette and, at a gas station further on, simply abandons Rayette by cadging a lift from a passing truck driver while she's busy buying a coffee in the diner. The stark end shows Rayette wandering around the gas station, trying to find Bobby...So, it's not much of a plot, all told. What raises it to the level of tragedy, almost, and makes it superlative drama, though, are the characters and the actors who bring them to all-too-believable life &#x96; and the life of small town Americana, about which Peter Bogdanovich also captured so well, a year later, in The Last Picture Show (1971). In FEP, however, the small town scene is simply a stark counterpoint to the classical family life that Bobby loves to hate, almost as much as he hates to love anything or anybody, including himself. One mixed-up dude, no question.The Oscar-worthy performances are from Nicholson and Black, for sure; but, the acting of the remaining cast cannot be faulted, I think, including Sally Ann Struthers in her first movie. Hence, much kudos must go to the director also, Bob Rafelson, for eliciting such strong performances from such a diverse group of actors; and for the script which has some of the best lines ever spoken on film. In truth, the entire experience of this movie reminds me of the perfection of Casablanca (1942), one of the most highly regarded movies of all time, where everything gelled.So also Five Easy Pieces, a film that will stand the test of time, I'm sure, as one of Hollywood's best. For me, the scenes that stick are Bobby throwing a fit of frustrated anger in his car; his attempts to get a sandwich at a diner (a classic scene, if ever there was one); playing the piano on a truck stuck in a traffic jam; crying at the feet of his mute and wheelchair-bound father in a futile attempt to communicate; and, of course, the truck disappearing in the distance as poor Rayette wanders about, looking for Bobby.As to the title? Well, some mention the classical music that permeates the sound track. I prefer the interpretation that links Bobby's misogyny with the five women he manipulates and plays so easily his girlfriend, a pickup from the bowling alley, the two lesbian hitchhikers, and his brother's fiancée.This is film making at its most mature.

I prefer the interpretation that links Bobby's misogyny with the five women he manipulates and plays so easily his girlfriend, a pickup from the bowling alley, the two lesbian hitchhikers, and his brother's fiancée.This is film making at its most mature. Highest recommendation for all adults, young and old.

They created the genre back in 1937 with 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' and kept making animated movies, even until today. The company holds credit for some truly all-time classics, such as the own 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs', 'Cinderella', 'Sleeping Beauty', etc. But back in 1994, when 'The Lion King' came out, it seemed like Disney was losing its touch, without the magic of the movies in former times. But 'The Lion King' changed that, showing that Disney still had it what it took to make a great movie, and they managed to make one of their best flicks.'The Lion King' tells the story of Sinbad, a young lion, son of the village's king, Mufasa. But the brother of Mufasa, Scar, always wanted to be king, and he feels threatened once Sinbad is born, because the throne goes to Sinbad, not to him. He then performs an elaborated plan to kill his own brother and convince the young Sinbad that he did it. Now Sinbad runs away because of shame, only to be persuaded to come back already as a grown lion and try to rule the kingdom instead of Scar. 'The Lion King's story is assumed as been a crossover of 'Hamlet' and 'Bambi'. It does have lots of elements of both's story, but the movie hold its own rights by telling the story, in a very excellent manner. The character study and development is amazing, extremely well-written script, except for a few parts, where characters make stupid choices, but it's really minor and you don't realize it. One thing I didn't like is the movie's running time, I mean, of course it's a children's movie, but it could run a little longer, showing missing parts like Sinbad growing up with Timom and Pumbaa. And talking about them, these are some of the best and most charismatic characters in an animated movie. They really stole the whole show. And the charisma Timom and Pumbaa have left, the main character doesn't. I really didn't like him, and when he grows up he is just like his father, you can't really distinguish them.The voice-acting in here is truly great. I think that the movie is quite well-cast, with some famous names like Matthew Broderick as the main character, Rowan Atkinson as Zazu, the king's adviser, Jeremy Irons as Scar, Whoopi Goldberg as Shenzi, one of the hyenas, and others not so- famous names, like Nathan Lane as Timon and Ernie Sabella as Pumbaa. In my opinion, the best member of the cast is Jeremy Irons. He managed to put such a depth on the villain, Scar, which I dare to say it's one of the best performances by an actor in a animated movie. It really blew me off. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella were also great as Timon and Pumbaa. Excellent chemistry between both.This movie was directed by two people, Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff. Generally, people say that directing an animated picture is easier than a live-action one, because you can put the camera wherever you want. It's true some times, but the animation has other challenges than a normal picture, and the both directors did a good job, except in the final fight scene. The use of slow-motion bothered me, it seemed like one lame action picture. But aside from this, the rest of the movie is greatly directed and animated. As for the animation, it's simply fantastic, there's nothing more to say about it. It one one the best 2-D animation ever. All the character's moves, the background, the effects of light and shadow, the representation of Africa's nature, the effect of depth and mainly the effects of fire and water are so real, but at the same time they have a beautiful, unique style. Thumbs up for the animators and the art-director, they used the huge movie's budget to animate it perfectly.This movie is also well-known by having one of the best soundtrack of an animated picture. It's true indeed. Elton John's and Tim Rice's songs are great for a children's film, but it's Hanz Zimmer's original music score that sets the mood perfectly. It has such a depth, such a soul to it, it's hard to imagine the movie without it. All the sequences are perfectly composed and executed, but it's the opening scene that still gives me chills every time I watch it. It's one of the best introductions to a movie of all time. That's mainly because of the perfect score and also the great cinematography, another perfect aspect about this movie. It's an animated movie, yes, but it has an excellent cinematography. There some scenes with a groundbreaking photography, the kind of thing to set the bar for others to come. Overral, 'The Lion King' is one of the best Disney's animated flicks and one of the best animated movies off all time. Personally, been a Pixar fan, I still prefer 3-D animation, but I can't deny that the 2-D animation here is excellent, with some great effects. The voice acting is nice, and Jeremy Irons delivered an incredible performance. Hanz Zimmer's original music score is one of the best of all time, together with the cinematography. 'The Lion King' proved Dysney still had it on them to make excellent pictures, but unfortunately they didn't make anything that even comes close to 'The Lion King' after it.

So it comes as a surprise that the Farrellys made a gentle romance...and it actually works.Oh, there's some of their trademark humor in the film. But it's more toned down, and while the film is undeniably light-hearted, the focus for the main part of the film is the romance between two people.Hal (Jack Black) is an immensely shallow bachelor. His standards for what qualifies as datable material are so high that they must be heard to be believed. Unfortunately for Hal, he's no Brad Pitt. After a chance meeting with self-help guru Tony Robbins (as himself), Hal's views of women are turned inside out. Now, how they are on the inside is projected (to him, at least) on the outside. What I mean is that good people look like bombshells to Hal, and the jerks look like hell. Then he meets Rosemary (Gwyneth Paltrow); to him, she's a goddess, but to others, like his equally shallow pal, Mauricio, she's a two-ton blob!Shallow Hal is about perception, and the difference between that and reality. People's visual appearance is only half of what makes a person who they are (if that), and that's something that Hal learns over the course of the movie.The two leads are great. Jack Black is surprisingly effective in a semi-dramatic role. We totally believe him as he tries to swoon Rosemary, who not being the blond bombshell that he thinks she is, believes he is making fun of her. As his opposite, Gwyneth Paltrow is simply radiant. She's a good person with a good soul, and while in other hands Rosemary may have turned out to be a caricature of Mother Theresa, Paltrow keeps Rosemary believable. Black and Paltrow have excellent chemistry together, and in a film that focuses more on the romance than the comedy, this is especially important.Supporting players like Jason Alexander, the late great Joe Vitrelli, Susan Ward, and of course, Tony Robbins, are great as well. Jason Alexander is great as the best friend whose shallowness is a response to his insecurities. Surprisingly, Tony Robbins is very effective, and not uncomfortable in a performance, but then again, this is kind of what he does for a living.The Farrellys have a reputation for being politically incorrect, and proud of it. And while there's some of that here, the people who make the jokes are shown to be stupid and shallow, or in the case of Rene Kirby (a womanizer who walks on all fours because of his spinal bifida), making fun of themselves.

Jason Alexander is great as the best friend whose shallowness is a response to his insecurities. Surprisingly, Tony Robbins is very effective, and not uncomfortable in a performance, but then again, this is kind of what he does for a living.The Farrellys have a reputation for being politically incorrect, and proud of it. And while there's some of that here, the people who make the jokes are shown to be stupid and shallow, or in the case of Rene Kirby (a womanizer who walks on all fours because of his spinal bifida), making fun of themselves. This avoids the trap of making the film exploitative or offensive.There's nothing especially noteworthy about this film, but it does do what it tries, and overall, it's a fun movie.

I was even more hyped when realized the movie has won five Academy Awards. As it turned out, however, I was greatly disappointed, as many fans of the books had echoed. I want to start by stating I have ever expected the movie to follow the book entirely, for it is understandably impossible to cram a 300+ pages story into a 2 hour movie. The main issue I have with the movie is that the director and actors had totally misinterpreted the characters and the core issues the writer of the book wanted to convey.Nurse Ratched was this machine-like ex-army nurse who represented the oppressive and dehumanized aspect of the modern society; she allowed no one to disrupt her absolute power in the ward and was depicted as a manipulative and tyrannous person in the book. Yet in the movie, she was cold-hearted and sort of oppressive alright, but one who essentially seemed to have the patient's best interest in mind. Who, as a matter of fact, was sort of the victim here, having this random guy messing around in the ward.And McMurphy. Oh boy, he was the ultimate hero in the book. Flawed and imperfect like the rest of us, he came to the realization that his initial rebellious acts against the Nurse out of selfishness became a ray of hope among the patients. He then came to challenge the Nurse on behalf of the patients, in hoped that by defeating the Nurse, the patients would heal from their sicknesses. In the movie, Jack Nicholson captured the free-spiritedness of the character but no further. His action seemed to be motivated by amusement rather than self sacrifice, which, imo, completely ruined the purpose of the book. Of course, the movie itself is not bad at all, there were some substantial acting, certain messages worth reflecting. However, if you want to capture the true beauty of the story, I strongly suggest you to read the book instead.
