The thought of big budget US movies with so many famous names that they can't all fit on the DVD box makes me want to run away and hide. In a box with no holes. Underground. But on holiday in Scotland with nothing else to do on a Tuesday night, i opted to watch Armageddon rather than listen to my dad give us the potted history of The Isle of Mull, thinking i could at least laugh at the bad acting and melodrama. The opening scenes didn't disappoint, they were suitably badly acted and melodramatic, and as i didn't check the credits, i hadn't realised that i had opted in for Liv Tylers weird ass body shape and crappy airy-fairy voice. Introducing her as the 'smart' daughter seemed too incredulous even for Hollywood. But i'm rambling; although the plot was implausible, when Bruce Willis our big Captain America calls in the help of his oddball team in the forms of Steve Buscemi, Owen Wilson, and t'others, i was in stitches right up until Liv Tyler had to share a scene with Ben Affleck. Steve Buscemi's performance was priceless, even when playing sleazy weirdo's he's got this amazing comic touch and an ability to make you care about his fate. If he had died I would have stopped watching. Maybe. I was actually quite surprised he didn't, i swear he always dies in films. I felt a bit sorry for Owen Wilson too, he didn't get enough screen time, even if he does have the weirdest nose ever, and I was genuinely surprised that they didn't sweep back and pull Bruce Willis from the brink of death, doom and destruction, in true Hollywood style. But ah well, I didn't exactly miss him.The angst scenes with Liv Tyler were unnecessary. As were the love scenes between her and Ben Affleck. In fact, her entire performance was unnecessary, i reckon they only cast her cos tehy needed a chick. Come of think of it, if they wanted a chick in the movie they should have put one on the mission. Bruce Willis was watchable, he's not a great actor but he knows what he's good at and sticks to it, and I like some of the films he's been in (Army of the 12 monkeys, 5th element) and Ben Affleck was so inoffensive i forgot he was there for most of the film. Oh yeah, i just remembered there was a chick on the mission, i forgot her too.Anyway, onto the bulk of the film, where they drill holes in an Asteroid and nuke it, I thought this was formulaic, but tense all the same. Probably because i'm paranoid about the end of the world. The special effects i thought actually added to the drama, which is odd because I could usually do without them. The great part about this was that it wasn't even taken too seriously, Steve Buscemi's space dementia picked me up at times where i felt any more layers of tense situation would make me explode. some of his one-liners, if not particularly original, were delivered expertly and with just the right amount of laughter at himself. I love Steve Buscemi, I really do. I want him to rule the world. And that pseudo Russian guy who didn't sound Russian (I dated a Russian bloke OK, I know what tehy sound like) he was funny too. I've forgotten his name but he's been in some good films. So anyway, they save the world, everyone (including me) is very relieved, Steve Buscemi makes it back to earth (i'm even more relieved) and the film ends. It was good, I felt satisfied with it. If I'd seen it in the cinema I would have felt that i'd had enough thrills and laughs for my money. And Steve Buscemi! ^___________^Maybe i'm a little biased. I have a soft spot for overly-long films, and films about the end of the world (because i'm paranoid about it), but anyhow, apart from King Kong (which i loved, also overly long!) I'd say this is my favourite Hollywood Blockbuster; it was tense, injected humour and sorrow in similar amounts, it was professionally done and very slick, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.

Character like LeFou, Lumiere and Cogsworth makes you laugh time after time, and parents can also find them self laughing of the sweet Chip. And lets not forget the evil in this movie, and his name is Gaston. Not scary, but VARY selfish and he won't give up for the things he want (okay maybe that's scary).

Everything in this film that is supposed to be so original had been done before and in most cases much better. Look at Black Christmas were the dolly shot was first pioneered, Blood Feast and Psycho, where some of the first slashers came out to play. See also the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Last House on the Left, and The Hills Have Eyes, for all of you people who say that Halloween was the first to be instrumental in bringing the modern wave of horror to America. I also hate it when John Carpenter acts like no one else can possible make a movie as great as him. You know what Rick Rosanthal's Halloween II, it's a better movie and it should be the one that is praised. Yeah I said it Halloween II is the better movie, and John Carpenter needs to get off his high horse and stop bad mouthing his legacy. Halloween is just a very, very slow paced independent movie that was lucky because it had a soulless producer named Moustpha Akkad who in later years would destroy every thing he worked so hard to build with Halloween H-2-0. To add to that he also never admitted it. I can say never because he's dead now (Which I am sorry for, when he died it felt like the Joker died, he was my enemy, and I miss him.)Now don't get me wrong. Just because I went on this rant does not mean that I do not have an affection for this little film. I just wish people would stop acting like it's the Beetles and maybe see that it's a little more like the Rolling Stones (It will never die.) I also in fact do love John Carpenter I just feel that he tries excessively to go out of his way and put down this series, and toot his own horn. I feel that his films Dark Star, Assualt on Precinct 13, Escape From New York, The Thing, and They Live are all better indications of his style. Why can he not be known for those films, and not for this film that is it's self a knock off, however a decent knock off. If you want to see real horror watch Halloween II (which Carpenter wrote but did not direct) and stay away from this dull first installment unless you just want to see where Michael started.It should also not go without mentioning that Donald Plesance rules in this just like everything else he does and he is the true spirit of the Halloween series (Not Carpenter, Curtis, or even Micheal Myeres can take that title away from him!!!)
