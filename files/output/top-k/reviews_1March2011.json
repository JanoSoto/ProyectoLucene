[{"date":"1 March 2011","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" **** out of ****Rushmore is a clear enough explanation to why Wes Anderson is my current favorite filmmaker. While I wasn't as smart as some and I didn't start liking Wes Anderson with his most successful film, I came to appreciate it more as time went on. Now, Rushmore has come from being a film I loved to a film I will cherish. It is now one of my favorites. Maybe it's because this time around, I caught a lot of things. I found the story to be a bit more touching than it already was; and I discovered just how much I want to be like Max Fischer. The kid carries himself like a gentlemen yet he's a dud when it comes to academics. Maybe I am somewhat like him already; just not quite as fascinating (or likable). Rushmore is a truly rare piece of cinema because for the first time in a while, everything in it seems to come together to make this massive dramedy that ranks amongst the best I've seen. Maybe it IS the best I've seen. Or maybe it's too soon to tell. None the less, Rushmore will forevermore be known as one of my favorite films of all time. Maybe it's not the most historical; and maybe it's not the most well-known, but this cult favorite is a hell of a time. Not only is it funny and touching but it's also artistic as far as complex style goes. The cinematography is flawless, the soundtrack is awesome, and the characters are endearing and layered with the kind of ominous complexity that makes you want to uncover their secrets (or problems, if you prefer). I've also come to realize that all of Wes Anderson's films end with a realization. The character(s) learn to value something through the ordeals of the film, and I guess it's safe to say that their troubles will pay off. Rushmore is almost the kind of delightful feast that makes you want a sequel, but then again it's too great of a film for a second coming. I think any further continuation of Max Fischer's story would ruin the thing all-together. Besides, I like how the film ends. This is the best film of 1998 and one of the best films of the 1990's all-together. If I had a top five list of my favorite films, then Rushmore would fit the bill. That's how much I love the most well-known of all Wes Anderson's wondrous creations. With Rushmore, I think he has improved a lot over the flaws of his previous Bottle Rocket. While I enjoyed that little film, it's nowhere near as awesome as Rushmore. And I don't care if it doesn't suit everyone's fancy; I just love this movie so darn much. I'd say it's worth it for everyone to give it a chance; whether they agree with the style or not.http\/\/www.rottentomatoes.com\/user\/721884\/reviews\/?search=rushmore ","genre":null},{"date":"1 March 2011","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" **** out of ****Rushmore is a clear enough explanation to why Wes Anderson is my current favorite filmmaker.

The movie is about six criminals who work together to rob a bank but their employer attempts to keep it professional. They all dress in suits and never use their real names so as to keep their real identities hidden. Interestingly the film completely revolves around the robbery but it is never actually shown with the entire movie jumping back and forth from before and after the robbery. It shows how the different men got hired on for the job and how they react to the robbery going completely wrong. Most of the group believes that they were set up so they also must discover which one of them is an undercover cop. So the story is very non-linear which really keeps it interesting and the movie really makes you keep on guessing about who the undercover cop is which is really good storytelling. So overall an excellent plot that works very well in the film.All of the actors do a stupendous job here in each of their roles. Harvey Keitel plays Mr. White and does a great job at getting sympathy, professionalism, and the ability to do what is necessary without needing to be pushed. Then there is Michael Madsen as Mr. Blonde or your psychopath of the film. He seems incredibly calm and professional around others but once they leave he really seems like a loon which means that he does a good job in his role. Tim Roth plays Mr. Orange who is injured throughout the majority of the movie (all of the after the robbery scenes) and he works really well too with how someone would act when they are injured like that. And we also have Steve Buscemi as Mr. Pink who isn't crazy or very professional either but he is smart and plans everything out. Just like everyone else in this movie he does his job perfectly. So we have some excellent acting here from the entire cast.When it comes down to the special effects they are quite good for the time period and budget with some very realistic looking injuries and wounds plus some great looking gunshots and just about everything else. The music has a lot of 1970s songs in it and it works surprisingly well for the movie. The soundtrack is iconic and memorable which really helps get the film off the ground.Overall, this isn't Quentin Tarantino's best film but it is still incredibly entertaining. It is incredibly violent and has some very course language but if you can sit through all of that then you'll really see a skilled filmmaker just beginning to master the craft. The non-linear storytelling is rarely used in films which really keeps the audience thinking and with such an incredible story, stupendous acting, and some decent production values this one is worth a watch.

Taking a humanistic viewpoint on an unbelievable and fictitious Italian family mob, The Corleone's, communicates to me how truly unAmerican this movie is. Seeing how Michael Corleone (aka Al Pacino's worst role) is experiencing inner dualism between morales and his family showed me how boring this movie really is. When I'm watching a good American film I want action, not character development! This movie was one big slumber-fest and there wasn't enough boobs!But what truly made me come to this decision was discovering the pile of popcorn and butter vomit that came from my mouth onto my smart phone's IMDb application, after revisiting this so called winner of Best Picture, Best Actor, and Best Adapted Screenplay. Critics of Coppola's uncreative, cookie-cutter, three hour long cheep film cheated and lied to the American population. Make no mistake, this Italian cultured film is worse than a serving of stuffed calamari in tomato sauce with no garlic, rotten eggs, and a pregnant squid pulled out of the Sarno River. For the those of you spent time to even explore the other two parts of the story, I apologize. When I eventually got up from my imitation leather lazy-boy for a bathroom break all that came out was Marlon Brando's crappy performance. Not to mention Diane Keaton expanding her acting career... should of stayed with Woody. I feel this movie was pretentious and belittled the American audience. Even Italian film theorist Jean Epstein would probably say, this movie was about as sincere as using Ragu in spaghetti. For my own taste, I'm going to stick with the true mob classics like Corky Romano and Mobsters (with the truly talented Christian Slater). Thanks for the waste of time Francis Ford Coppola!

Set in the wet summer of 1969, it's also about the come-down after the summer of love and revolution years of 1967 and 1968 as Withnail (and I) move in and out of various stages of intoxication to get through their grim existence.To escape their filthy squat and state of unemployment, they embark on a weekend in the country at Withnail's camper-than-Butlins older Uncle Monty who has his beady eyes on Paul McGann's I and can't resist turning up to attempt to have his way with him. This is probably the comic highlight of the film, with Richard Griffiths' passionate intent (literally) up against McGann's terrified reserve in a scene that'll have you squirming and giggling at the same time. There are other funny scenes too, as the drunken duo alight on a posh tea-shop as well as Withnail's brush with the law after being caught drink- driving, where his carefully worked-out anti-breathalyser strategy comes unstuck.That said, there's pathos in the ending too with Withnail's bemoaning the loss of his friend of the summer, declaiming Shakespeare in the pouring rain, leaving the impression that the film is also about this intense sometimes bizarre moments you go through and then look back in with a mixture of pleasure and incredulity, but also sadness for their passing.It's impossible not to like both leads, Richard E Grant, in particular, creating an iconic character study in dissipation while McGann is just as good in the less showy part of his partner in crime. Griffiths almost steals the film with his turn as the blinded-by-lust uncle, but really all three actors inhabit their parts terrifically well, although you'll be glad you only had to witness rather live through this particular weekend.

She always wears dresses, is polite, and even curtsies. Rhoda can even roller skate. But anyone that crosses her the wrong way is in danger, danger for his life. Rhoda is not beyond lying, cheating, or murdering. The scratchy-voiced, strained and suspicious mother Christine (Nancy Kelly) suspects that she herself was adopted into the nice Bravo family from a family of criminals. Is it possible that she has passed on her evil genes to Rhoda? After all, the amoral child has no conscience she can readily read a child's book right after causing a drowning or she can play a musical piece on the piano after causing someone to burn to death.The Bad Seed may have been a bit talky and theatrical as it was adopted from a Broadway play with many of the original actors. For instance, ten-year old Patty McCormack reprised her role. Nevertheless it can be a bit unnerving for any parent of a young child who wonders how she will turn out. The subject matter is so difficult and the tension so obvious that the film director had the cast take bows after the movie's end.
