Now I must disagree; while this is bad; it's not amusingly bad, or even close! This equation of it is so clear. It is Pamela Anderson + the comics Barb Wire + Casablanca + low budget + Tasteless everything = hellish movie-making! I'm absolutely not a Pamela's fan. The best description she ever got came from one friend of mine (strangely about her sight in here in specific), he said word for word  she looks like a fat black woman who turned into thinner and white suddenly!. I think with the matters of the big lips and the thin legs the problem gets weirder, since according to that she'd be half black, and half white (without many qualities from both!). In brief  she's the most photographed ugly woman I've ever seen !As an actress, she can be funny sometimes. Hence with a Rick Blaine role, it could've been so funny, kind of ha haa haaay funny. But it didn't !Nothing is distinct in this movie, if we're talking about right things of course ! It tries all the time to hit the furthest campy degree anyone can reach. The idea of remaking Casablanca with Pamela Anderson could have been ironic or sexy enough, but it is done just horrible enough, being you mustn't remember this by all means! The actors are brought out of the worst V movies I don't watch. The clothes and the sets are supposed to be atmospheric but it ended up turning me off. I hated the many fade-outs (as it's a sad meditative movie), the no special effects, and the outdoor scenes; since they seemed all made around the same warehouse !Actually the lighting, the cinematography and the whole directing achieve a goofy status more than a decent comic book action. Now this is a director who has no good taste in anything. At times I thought that his main plan was to make a poor man's Batman and Gotham city, but eventually I found out that he already made just a poor thing of entertainment ! I couldn't find one factor, or moment, that can be called fun. Even the action is dull; suffice to say that I found myself pressing the fast-forward button at the climax&#x85;AT THE CLIMAX! As a whole it can create so perfect uninteresting mood while it's on, with a strange feel about it in your stomach as well. WAW, it serves defining campiness smartly! Frankly the mix of serious story, odd sets, poor production, crappy acting and a lead like Pamela suits usual pedant porn. So, how about having all of that already without any sex scenes ! True that I don't like porn, but the irony is just killing me!Why the genre movies, I mean the non-pornographic ones, of playboy's dolls like (Anna Nicole Smith, Pamela Anderson, Paris Hilton) were in most cases terribly made ones ?! Well, they surely wanted to be just movie stars, not movie actresses. And they were stupid enough to pick the wrong movie-makers every time!So what's here to be loved? Hmmm, Nothing! I'm a fan of good looking women and sexy dances. And apparently this one got none! To be fair; maybe the kisses of the lead to her ex-lover in the elevator would be something watchable. But on a second thought; they were forgettable! Ahhh, it's a campy movie, one of the highest indeed. However it even can't be liked for that apart. Hence the thing that this movie accurately defines isn't campy after all; it's rather the *hateful* campy!P.S  I'm still vexed that Pamela Anderson didn't win the 1996 Razzie's nomination for her Impressive Enhancements as the Worst Screen Couple.

They could be the means with which to tell a simple story or present a message with contemporary relevance. Friendly Persuasion is an unpretentious costume drama (not technically a Western although it looks a bit like one) which speaks about pacifism and the difficulties of reconciling religious discipline with human self-expression.Unusually for a picture from this era, Friendly Persuasion only had one screenwriter, the blacklisted Michael Wilson. Although Wilson had done some great stuff in collaboration, the fact that he was on his own here shows. The overall idea and structure of the story is very strong. The first part is full of light humour and touching vignettes of family life, the idea of this presumably to give more impact to the darker and more dramatic final act. However this build-up and meditation on Quaker life is all a bit too neat and simplistic, as temptations such as dancing, fighting and gambling are lined up and dealt with one after the other. Even the weightier finale I feel pulls too many punches, with a very pat ending that seems almost disrespectful to the issues involved.Behind the camera is director William Wyler, one of the very best. Unfortunately Wyler, who around this time had a self-confessed urge to move away from small-scale dramas towards the fun of the big picture, seems to have neglected some of his dramatic sensibilities. It is great that he brings the most out of the landscape's beauty, and uses this as a backdrop for the tenderness of the story. It's also brilliant that he tends to use long takes with multiple characters in the shot, allowing scenes to play out naturally before us. However, he doesn't close things down often enough to bring in intimacy or personal space. He doesn't isolate characters so our whole focus is on them, at least not until the final act. In the broad expanse of the first part of the picture, we miss out on any real emotional connection with individuals via the camera. Not that I would want him to overuse the more intimate techniques, and in fact the beauty of his earlier pictures was that he didn't overuse them, but when he did put them in he got them just right. Thank goodness for the cast, upon whose shoulders it mainly falls to convey the sympathy and humanity of this picture. Although he apparently didn't like the role, Gary Cooper is just what you need here &#x96; relaxed, steady and universally likable. Conversely though, he and co-star Dorothy McGuire did not get along &#x96; although you'd never know it, since she comes across believably as his perfect companion. Some wonderful supporting players provide the picture with its only effective comedy. Walter Catlett, here sounding more than ever like Honest John from Pinocchio, manages to give a hilarious turn from a part that isn't really funny on paper, but is under his delivery. Marjorie Main is terrific, in a section of the story that is somewhat silly and unnecessary, but made bearable by her understatement. And then of course Russell Simpson, a familiar face from many John Ford pictures, who does little more here than give disapproving looks, but adding a wonderful comic touch by doing so. The standout performance is undoubtedly that of Anthony Perkins, perhaps a little unfairly so because his role is the only one that really calls for such a level of passion and intensity, but he does magnificently. At the Oscars he lost out to Anthony Quinn in Lust for Life. Fair enough, Perkins is a little too overwrought at times, whereas Quinn is always full and rounded. Friendly Persuasion is a picture that ought to be excellent, and in many little ways it is.

It could be the most expensive Hollywood movie without stars. It looks so-innocent-it's-so-80s. And it's a cult classic for anyone wants to study the bad decisions of big studios' executives! I love it. Save (The green alien) plus seeing (Mark Addy) and (Stephen Baldwin) in girly dresses it's nice. Not indigestible like (Bad Boys 2). Not unfunny like (Pirates of the Caribbean2). Not filthy like (American Pie). And not eye-exhausting (like the new Star Wars movies). But even if you loved it you've got to notice 2 things. The stars of the movie aren't stars. And the budget is big.. just strangely big. In fact the jest of live Flintstones came to a point where it had been taken seriously, REAL seriously. I believe the mentality of Hollywood has never been bolder to put all of these millions in a family, no stars, movie. Well,.. I said bolder, not dumber!The costumes, the sets and the extras were all overblown. Many backgrounds were made without any CGI ; true that seems now as an attractive point apart, but I bet that demanded a whole lot of money back then. The bad irony of this movie is that after the first one the cast got smaller and everything else got bigger!Over and above, (Harvey Korman) was out of his gloss. (Baldwin) looked suitable as goofy but not too memorable. (Alex Meneses) is nothing compared to her antecedent (Halle Berry). (Joan Collins) well, I have never known anything good about her (to be fair  a photo of her on the beach while she was in her early twenties, and that's it!). The leads did their best to be enjoyable, being the cornerstone of the movie's cuteness. But to spend this amount of money on them is so unwise move; especially when they looked like shadows for the first hit's cast. Let alone being in a prequel for it ?? (Have you ever heard about a hit prequel ?!). Sometimes I think that it was mainly intended for the first one's stars, and then it got a last minute change. And other times I think that the sets were intended to be part of the studio's tour whether the project hit it high or flopped. Whatever the case may be, this movie wronged its cast; they seemed so tiny in it. Generally, this is fun time for sure.

Not filthy like (American Pie). And not eye-exhausting (like the new Star Wars movies). But even if you loved it you've got to notice 2 things. The stars of the movie aren't stars. And the budget is big.. just strangely big. In fact the jest of live Flintstones came to a point where it had been taken seriously, REAL seriously. I believe the mentality of Hollywood has never been bolder to put all of these millions in a family, no stars, movie. Well,.. I said bolder, not dumber!The costumes, the sets and the extras were all overblown. Many backgrounds were made without any CGI ; true that seems now as an attractive point apart, but I bet that demanded a whole lot of money back then. The bad irony of this movie is that after the first one the cast got smaller and everything else got bigger!Over and above, (Harvey Korman) was out of his gloss. (Baldwin) looked suitable as goofy but not too memorable. (Alex Meneses) is nothing compared to her antecedent (Halle Berry). (Joan Collins) well, I have never known anything good about her (to be fair  a photo of her on the beach while she was in her early twenties, and that's it!). The leads did their best to be enjoyable, being the cornerstone of the movie's cuteness. But to spend this amount of money on them is so unwise move; especially when they looked like shadows for the first hit's cast. Let alone being in a prequel for it ?? (Have you ever heard about a hit prequel ?!). Sometimes I think that it was mainly intended for the first one's stars, and then it got a last minute change. And other times I think that the sets were intended to be part of the studio's tour whether the project hit it high or flopped. Whatever the case may be, this movie wronged its cast; they seemed so tiny in it. Generally, this is fun time for sure.

The film provokes the subconscious part of the ''watcher'' through a mysterious and obscure gigantic space. Millions of years ago before humankind existed Kubrick choose to personify that mystery in The Monolith scene to express the dawn of man, the way the monolith behaved, and try to communicate could be interpreted as an ''attempt to communication '', as the monolith disappears once the magical alignment appeared and foretells us the beginning of Man's development. The journey through space started with a magnificent soundtrack completely opposite of the one in first chapter which extraordinary matches with the description or the promenade that Stanley Kubrick made us experience through the so wonderful space, to show us one of the best quality of this movie which is the quality of the image and visual effect (knowing that this film was realized in 1968) which personally wowed me. In this part it shows us the cerebral human being in the pinnacle of the technology development and also introduce us to one of the most important actor or character I would say ''Who is'' HALL 900 plays a big role in the depiction of the technology versus Human being , a computer capable of interacting emotionally and intellectually as humans. The dramatic scene in where hall doesn't want to open the pod bay doors to Bowman, Stanley Kubrick showed us how humankind can be victim of its own tools. The film is much more known for its mysterious end because the plot isn't something limited, let us remember you that this film isn't about a definite subject and it becomes what you see in it while you are watching it and that's make the movie even beautiful and special at the same time.

Then I remembered that a short time before the incidents on which this film is based occurred, there was a film made called Tic Tic Tic. This also involved a southern town growing out of the old days and into the new ones with the post Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act. In that film a new black sheriff played by Jim Brown is elected in a southern town and he asks the former sheriff George Kennedy to stay on as his deputy to help ease the tensions.When the folks who were making Tic Tic Tic happen on the big screen, how could they have known that life was imitating their art. This northern Virginia town was being integrated, black people were now voting, the schools and businesses were being integrated, the city fathers had to take into account a whole new population with the franchise. Successful football coach Will Patton is asked to step aside for Denzel Washington, newly arrived from North Carolina. Patton agrees to stay on as his defensive assistant coach to help the team and not incidentally the town. Because of the good will and good intentions of two strong personalities they make the newly integrated team the Titans work.Even with two Academy Awards and several nominations besides, I doubt Denzel Washington will ever get a more beloved role than Herman Boone. In addition to coach, Washington is husband to Nicole Ari Parker and father to Krysten Leigh Jones. Later on when Patton's daughter Hayden Panettiere comes over to the Washington household to visit, she spends more time with Washington going over the game than with her peer dressing the dolls that little girls are supposed to play with. My favorite scene in the film is with Washington and Panettiere who loves the idea of a child even a girl taking an interest in what puts food on the table, but not quite understanding it. The kids make it work as well. Ryan Hurst who was the team captain under Patton and Donald Faison one of the new black players forge their own bond and make it happen for the rest. Those who won't go with the new program have to learn or leave. My two favorites are the two outsiders who also help make it work. Kip Pardue plays a California hippie type kid who also likes football, if you can fathom that combination and Ethan Suplee who just moved into town and just wants to play football. Neither of them are hung up on all the racial stuff the town was going through, they're presence on the Titans is invaluable.You won't have any problems in remembering the Titans. This is a fine inspirational film showing that people of good will can put hate aside if the better parts of their person is appealed to.

In addition to coach, Washington is husband to Nicole Ari Parker and father to Krysten Leigh Jones. Later on when Patton's daughter Hayden Panettiere comes over to the Washington household to visit, she spends more time with Washington going over the game than with her peer dressing the dolls that little girls are supposed to play with. My favorite scene in the film is with Washington and Panettiere who loves the idea of a child even a girl taking an interest in what puts food on the table, but not quite understanding it. The kids make it work as well. Ryan Hurst who was the team captain under Patton and Donald Faison one of the new black players forge their own bond and make it happen for the rest. Those who won't go with the new program have to learn or leave. My two favorites are the two outsiders who also help make it work. Kip Pardue plays a California hippie type kid who also likes football, if you can fathom that combination and Ethan Suplee who just moved into town and just wants to play football. Neither of them are hung up on all the racial stuff the town was going through, they're presence on the Titans is invaluable.You won't have any problems in remembering the Titans. This is a fine inspirational film showing that people of good will can put hate aside if the better parts of their person is appealed to.

Almost definitively, from here on out.He had plenty of features after Eraser (and before his governorship,) but none that reminded us why Schwarzenegger was a justified big-budgeted action star. And though predictable, silly at moments and mimicked Schwarzenegger's Terminator in more than one way, Eraser is still thoroughly enjoyable. As was Vanessa Williams. She stole every scene she was in, and it would be nice to see more singers-turned-actor take a performance like this.Schwarzenegger stars as John Kruger whose job is to, well, erase the lives of people set up for witness protection by faking their deaths and setting up anonymous new identities. Sure his methods might be severe, unorthodox, unethical and obviously confidential, he's the best and gets the job done. The movie's main target is Lee Cullen (Williams) after she's approached to rat out an illegal weapons manufacture. But, wait! Inside the branch Kruger works, there's a mole! If you can't tell who the mole is in first few shots, don't worry; they'll tell you soon enough. Kruger spends the rest of the movie on the lam with Cullen as he's being, get this! Set up! And he attempts to clear his name and save the dame at the same time.Sure the movie's as predictable as most Schwarzenegger movies are, but due to a lot of great action sequences, Williams' performance and a real ode to The Terminator (Terminator 3, a few years down he road, doesn't count as it sucked bad) this movie is highly recommended for die-hard Schwarzenegger fans.Suffice to say, it's hard to go further into this without giving away so-called surprises. Skip everything since this 1996 gem and enjoy the real Schwarzenegger.

As far as what is translated from the book goes, the mystery does work well. It is fairly engaging, and keeps you guessing to an extent. With that said, you know who's behind it the moment you see him, since *the score instantly becomes ominous when the camera shows him*. This has its entertaining moments, and occasional humor. The performances are great, though these talented actors have all done better work elsewhere. Ormond fails to make the character particularly likable, and her accent does not convince.

Basically, it is all about the origins of the world's most famous Christmas character, the has become the staple of many seasonal films, with a little adventure as well. The first half of the film sees Santa Claus (David Huddleston), in the 14th Century, arrive at the North Pole with his wife Anya (Judy Cornwell), and as a kind woodcutter delivering presents to the children of his town, they are found by the Vendequm, or Elves. They are the chosen ones, given immortality, with Santa being the big red suit, sleigh and eight (where's Rudolph) reindeer to deliver all presents to the nice children of the world, throughout the centuries. When it reaches the 20th Century, the second half of the film begins, when elf Patch (Dudley Moore) leaves for making mistakes in present making, and he winds up in New York City. There he meets toy making company owner B.Z. (Shrek's John Lithgow), convinced their toys are fast selling (they weer actually clearing out), and he gives them the secret of his flying dust, which is manufactured into special sweets. Santa finds out about what Patch has been up to, and knowing B.Z. is a villain, he is determined to stop him, save Patch, and retain status as the true toy making magic man, or whatever. Also starring Batman's Burgess Meredith as Ancient Elf, Jeffrey Kramer as Towzer, Christian Fitzpatrick as Joe, Carrie Kei Heim as Cornelia, John Barrard as Dooley, Anthony O'Donnell as Puffy and Melvyn Hayes as Goober. Huddleston seems a suitable choice for the jolly hero, Moore is alright as the troubled elf, and I recognised the voice of Lord Farquaad as an appropriate villain.
