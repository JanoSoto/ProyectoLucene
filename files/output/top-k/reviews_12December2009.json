As for John Travolta, I liked the character a lot and every time, it it fun to watch. Honestly, without him, the movie might have been run of the mill. His smoking cigarette style and his mimics are unforgettable. The scene which he tries to break the bomb is one of my favorites. There is a very long action sequence in a cave that recalls The Rock. As we expected from a John Woo movie, a lot of bullets, acrobatic acts etc. almost all it has. I like the explosion scene, too, again especially for John Travolta. Despite, the movie and the characters seem shallow, I believe that one of his best performances of John Travolta is here. The relationship between Riley and Terry is very cliché (generally, there is a supporter of the hero in action movies and it is often a female), but this is not so important. The last part of the movie is again a very long action sequence and some moments feed on other John Woo movies like MI-2, but I did not like the end, it was disappointing and a bit weird.

Even after all these years I remember my parents taking me to the movies to see ERNEST GOES TO CAMP and I remember how happy I was at the age of eight to know this movie here was coming out. As I went to view this movie again, probably my first time in fifteen-years, I wasn't really sure what to expect but it wasn't too bad.

The film certainly didn't thrill me or entertain me as much as when I was a kid but that's to be expected. I'm sure kids today would still eat this film as it's still extremely cute and the message is still there. I'm sure adults will have to be fans of Ernest but I find him charming in his own way. Only Jim Varney could create a character like this and while it's true he's obnoxious, that's kinda the point as the character was aimed at children. With that in mind I think he made a very love able character that many kids will continue to enjoy over the years. Even when I forget that I'm now an adult, the character makes me smile. As for the film, it starts off a lot better than it ends. I think the first thirty-minutes are quite clever as we get a few good twists and the storyline itself, while simple, is still pretty imaginative. I think what really hurts the movie are the cut aways to the Chuck and Bobby characters by series regulars Gailard Sarain and Bill Byrge. The scenes with them and the reindeer's never get any laughs and they really take away from the action going on with Ernest and Santa.

Giant is a true epic drama or, if you like, dramatic epic, of a kind rarely seen since Gone with the Wind.The adaptation apparently makes a fair few changes to Edna Ferber's novel, while still remaining faithful to the ideas and tone of the original. I'm not familiar with the book, but I can recognise the brilliance of its screenplay, written by Fred Guiol and Ivan Moffat. Yes, it is very long, but while some might harp on about a story just as deep being told in half the time, length must be correctly suited to the material. It is important to give us the real impression of the passage of time, and allow change to be shown gradually. This is why the skimpy extant version of Magnificent Ambersons is so dissatisfying &#x96; it's not so much the content of what was lost, but the amount that was lost. The stupendous length also allows for believable character development, whereby our sympathies for different characters (particularly Bick and Jet) shift as the story unfolds.But it's not just the screenplay which is rich. Director George Stevens demonstrates a terrific economy of expression, and packs meaning into every shot. His round-the-clock coverage of scenes allows the editors (who were closely supervised by Stevens himself) to quickly insert shots of individuals on the periphery of the situation, perhaps just adding a little visual commentary to a moment, or reminding us of a character's existence &#x96; for example the cut to the black servant's reaction when Elizabeth Taylor states that Texas was stolen from the Mexicans. Sometimes a speaking character will be offscreen, allowing us to follow two threads at once. When a scene requires a continual flow rather than lots of cutting, Stevens still manages to maintain similar effects by staging in depth and keeping multiple characters active on different layers within the set. He acknowledges just how much information the human brain can take in at once, and uses this to tell a story that is a wealth of detail and interwoven narrative, much like a major novel.What's very unusual though about Stevens' direction, is that he is one of the few directors who does not clearly define spaces (other than those who couldn't simply through being inept). What I mean is, the varying shots in a scene are so confusingly different, it's sometimes hard to get a clear impression of the layout of each room. This might seem annoying if you focus on it, until you realise that Stevens chooses his angles entirely in terms of where people are in relation to one another. A good example of this is in that dinner scene a few minutes in, where we get some really freakish angles from the edges of the dinner table. But what these particular angles suggest is that, while conversation is going on all round the table, it is the budding relationship between Taylor and Rock Hudson that we have to watch.An intelligent creative team is well served by an able cast. This is the most convincing upwards-ageing of actors I have seen from this period, and it's not just down to the considerable talents of the makeup department. The leads do their best to actually act old. Rock Hudson is the most successful at this, as well as having the guts to play Bick Benedict as apparently rough and unfeeling, allowing our admiration for him to emerge gradually from his words and actions. James Dean shows some development since his impassioned teenager roles. His middle-aged man act is quite impressive, although once or twice slips into caricature, and his overall performance is still outdone by that in East of Eden. A couple of honourable mentions among the supporting cast &#x96; Chill Wills, nicely understated in one of his best performances, Mercedes McCambridge, who it really appears could do no wrong, and Dennis Hopper, betraying his inexperience but still more satisfying here than in later, more extreme roles.Giant is not quite as well known as many of the other big pictures of this era, but despite its dramatic storyline and lack of razzmatazz it is still gripping and fast-moving.

The quick fire dialogue and superb repartee are so engaging that they command the attention of the audience right from the start and also provide added impetus to all the action that follows. Billy Wilder and Raymond Chandler collaborated in adapting James M Cain's story for the movie and the end result was nothing short of brilliant and was understandably nominated for the Academy Award for Best Writing, Screenplay in 1945.The characters featured in this evil tale are very memorable and in the case of the two main protagonists are also very immoral. Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray) is a fast talking insurance salesman who goes to visit a client and in his absence meets his wife Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck). Their first encounter during which Dietrichson appears dressed only in a bath towel, leads to some flirting and their relationship develops further when Dietrichson eventually convinces Neff to take part in a scheme to sell her husband an accident policy (unknown to Mr Dietrichson) and then to murder him so that the couple can collect the insurance money and enjoy a future together.Neff advises that the policy will pay out double if the fatal accident occurs on a train and so, when Mr Dietrichson is due to go on a business trip, arrangements are made for him to travel by train. Neff carries out the murder and dressed like Mr Dietrichson (complete with crutches) takes his place on the train journey before the couple place the body on the tracks to give the impression that Mr Dietrichson died as the result of an accidental fall from the observation car of the train.After having carried out their plan successfully, the events that follow conspire to introduce a series of complications which lead to the couple losing their trust in each other and also to the movie's dramatic conclusion.Fred MacMurray is perfect in his role as the very self assured Neff who's corrupted by lust and a greed for wealth. His portrayal of someone who thinks he knows all the angles but whose confidence is gradually eroded as things start to go wrong is very convincing and Barbara Stanwyck is also excellent as the cold, manipulative seductress who is utterly ruthless and seemingly devoid of any human feelings. Edward G Robinson appears in the role of Barton Keyes, a claims investigator who works for the same firm as Neff. Barton is very experienced and incredibly good at his job and possesses a strong instinct which enables him to sense immediately if a claim is likely to be fraudulent. He and Neff enjoy a longstanding friendship which involves a good deal of warmth and mutual respect. Robinson's performance is outstanding as he delivers some super-fast speeches and conveys the nature of his character's idiosyncrasies with great panache.In typical film noir style, the story is told in flashback with Neff's narration providing a particularly matter-of-fact account of what happened. When he says I killed him for money and for a woman. I didn't get the money and I didn't get the woman, there's an inherent poignancy in his words but the delivery is completely lacking in any sentimentality or self pity. The same can be said for his remark that we did it so that we could be together, but it's tearing us apart.Double Indemnity is a dark thriller which became the prototype for many later movies which told similar stories but rarely with the same style and impact as the original. Billy Wilder's direction is superb and especially successful in contributing to the high levels of suspense that are generated at various junctures throughout the action. This is a film of rare quality and one that, because of its subject matter, will undoubtedly continue to be a source of great entertainment and fascination for movie lovers for many years to come.

It has been a sticker in my collection in that I turn to it now and then for some sort of indescribable fix. I can't put my finger on it but there is something about it that clings to the visual memory. But then when I do watch it after a long hiatus I wonder what I ever thought was so good about it when it possesses so many flaws and laughable dialogue.Part of the attraction, a major part, is the physical magnetism of William Holden, who was too old for this role but managed to convey a compelling animal magnetism that rivets the eye and the imagination. There are just too many lines in his forehead to convince as a 20- something drifter. And the impetuousness of the character, as written, sits uneasily with the older actor.But somehow Holden makes it work, though he wasn't the greatest actor in the world he was a great star and that's what this movie is all about. Kim Novak is a better actor than Holden and if you can get past the horrible mess technicolor makes of her rat's nest of a hair-do you can see clearly how versatile this often-maligned actress was. I watched her carefully this last viewing and was struck by how she was very much the earlier prototype of Patricia Arquette (Lost Highway). Novak also has Arquette's sweet\/gritty quality that makes her headlong rush towards sensuality convincing.The script is structurally brilliant but the dialogue is often risible. 'Picnic' is indeed a sexy film, almost over the top in camp innuendo, and the dialogue plays this up. There they are, a community of aging women and sexually naive girls, then bammo, here comes a studly hunk out of a passing box car and all hell breaks lose. All the women go bonkers, overwhelmed by long-dormant hormones that are suddenly aroused by Holden's atmosphere choking testosterone level. I last watched this with a younger friend who had never seen this movie before and he was swept away by the barometric pressure of repressed sexuality and spent the rest of the movie making up his own highly pornographic dialogue, which was funny for awhile but, being young, went on for too long and ruined the best parts of the movie which come near the middle and at the end.Every character in this film is effected by Holden's sexuality, even, especially, the men. Nick Adam's young dude inspired much imaginative chatter from my young friend, especially the scene at the lake with everyone in swimming trunks. As 'Picnic' was made in the mid 1950s it is extremely coy about sex in that you don't see any, but it's going on behind the scene. There are two acts of fornication, off screen, that are lightly alluded to. When Holden moves and dances the camera cuts him off mid-crotch, rather like Elvis being edited from the waste down on the Ed Sullivan show. But Holden's attributes are abundantly obvious when he's just standing there presenting no momentary sexual threat. But the dancing scene between Holden and Novak is unadulterated eroticism and is one of the reasons this film remains in the forefront of 1950s melodrama.Having said that, there are some highly charged scenes of the underground sexual stampede in progress. Rosalind Russell plays a frustrated middle-aged school teacher who fears a lonely life in a boarding house with other old women. Her hormones go ballistic when she claps her eyes on Holden. There is a very intense scene at the night-time picnic in the park in which Russell gets drunk and throws herself at Holden, ripping his shirt in shreds at the end. Later she gets her half-gay boyfriend, Arthur O'Connell, to screw her then marry her. Potboiler stuff!The poorer technical aspects of 'Picnic' are the primitive ugly technicolor plus careless editing and continuity. The switch from medium shot dialogue to close-up reveals a lack of attention to detail, like the sudden change in hair-styles between the two shots, and so on. The backgrounds for little trips in the mustard colored Lincoln convertible are clearly filmed on a set and look fake but that was par for the course in those days. There are some stunning visuals of sunsets and wide-angle views of the Kansas prairie. It is the cinematography, in spite of the technicolor, that keeps me coming back to this movie.This film shows the 1950 Midwest ethos exactly as it really was. My young satiric friend found sinister undertones in the Neewollah (that's Halloween backwards) ritual when the Queen of the picnic comes floating down the lagoon in her swan boat. But those were innocent times, not universally rife with religious repression and social unrest, as the current press will have us believe as it tries to rewrite the history of that era. People, generally speaking, were much happier then than they are now.'Picnic' is a strange movie; a classic of homo-eroticism and simmering sexual desire and, as time passes, ever more camp, and a sui generis display of the Method school of acting. But it will hold its place in the annals of film if only as a museum piece with some sultry scenes of sexual mania unleashed in a quiet Kansas town. A staple of any complete film buff's library.

Well, frankly, it seems to put forth all it really has to say within the first fifteen to twenty minutes, and after that, it simply keeps restating it, occasionally in a different way than earlier in the movie. The one message that this contains is that the press can and will blow things out of proportion, and manipulate facts as well as those who follow them in order to stay informed. As admirable as it is to make an effort to ensure that everyone is aware of that sad truth, don't we all already know that? If this would at least explore it, go into what has led to it, and what makes people go along with it, it would quite possibly make for excellent cinema. As it is, this honestly winds up being a one-sided attempt at convincing its audience that things are a certain way, no matter what else they might believe, which is, ironically, exactly like the type of news-reporting that it is trying to decry. While 15 Minutes wasn't a masterpiece, it at least had satire, and was more entertaining than this. There is some violence and brief language in this.

If the experiments conducted in this movie for example perhaps could had led to a cure for cancer the whole story and characters would had worked out more compelling and the story as a whole would had been more intriguing.The movie is still more than a good one though. It's a movie that has David Cronenberg written all over it, except that it's not made by Cronenberg at all. See this movie perhaps as a mixture of Cronenberg's Videodrome and The Fly. The movie does definitely has some tripping visual moments in it, that are done very well and could had easily fitted in one of those early Cronenberg pictures like Videodrome or Scanners.The movie is helped made somewhat more believable by the fine actors that are in it. It was actually William Hurt's first cinematic movie role, while he was already 30. He was really fine in this movie, as the leading man. It also stars Bob Balaban, in one of his roles in which he plays a scientist again. For an 1980 movie it has some pretty good effects, though the movie still mostly relies on its editing techniques for its trippy moments. The movie often does a good job at creating both a science-fiction and horror feeling for the movie. The musical score by John Corigliano also helps with this. He actually deservingly received an Oscar nomination for it. This guy is a real great composer and conductor who however never scores much for movies. So far he only did 3 movies in his career, for which he in 2000 received an academy award for his work on Le violon rouge.Not a bad movie to watch but lacking a real purpose to leave a truly lasting impression.7\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":null},{"date":"12 December 2009","score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" This is one of those science-fiction movies that puts it emphasis on science.

Everyone should know the story but Scrooge is warned by his old partner Marley (Leo G. Carroll) that he's going to be visited by three ghosts and his fate depends on what he learns. I've seen quite a few versions of this famous story and I must admit that I think all of them are charming in their own right and most of the credit must go to Dickens himself for writing such an amazing story that we all know so well that sometimes it's hard to believe someone could come up with such a clever story and message. I wouldn't say this is my favorite versions of the story, that would probably be the one with George C. Scott, but there's still plenty to enjoy here. What works best is that the film really doesn't add any filler as the thing runs a brief 68-minutes so it's pretty much to the point from start to finish. We briefly get to know the characters and then we're off to the races as the filmmakers are certainly expecting the viewer to know what's going on and who's who. Owen was excellent at playing the happy Scrooge but I felt he wasn't nearly mean enough in the darker role. I certainly enjoyed his performance here but it seems like he was either held back from being too dark or he simply didn't go a bit further with the role. On the other hand, he's flawless as the happy Scrooge and really makes that part of the character his very own and is quite memorable in the final moments of the film. Gene Lockhart turns in a very good performance as Cratchit and Barry MacKay is also very good as Scrooge's nephew.
