However, it would be a big mistake to think that every 50s horror movie was a bad display of special effects, as the classic Warner Brothers film titled Them!, one of the first of those nuclear monster films, proves clearly. Made a year after the success of The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms, this movie followed similar themes, but gave them a more horror oriented spin and single-handed became the source of countless imitators.Sgt. Ben Peterson (James Whitmore) investigates a strange series of disappearances and murders happening in New Mexico's desert, and since one of the missing persons was an FBI agent, agent Robert Graham (James Arness) is sent to collaborate with Peterson in the investigation, however, the only clue they have is the strange prints found at the crime scenes. As the death toll increases, they send the print to be analyzed in the FBI headquarters, but in return the FBI sends Dr. Harold Medford (Edmund Gwenn) from the Department of Agriculture and his daughter, Dr. Patricia Medford (Joan Weldon), in order to aid them in their work. While the two law enforcers are confused at first by this decision, soon they discover that the Medfords were sent because the responsible of the killings is not human.Based on a story by George Worthing Yates (actually his first foray into science fiction), Them! presents a story that still feels fresh in this its original form (despite having been copied countless times). Playing on the Cold War fears of Nuclear technology, Them! starts as a murder mystery that grows bigger and suddenly becomes a matter of global security. What truly makes Them! to stand out among the rest of the movies of its time, it's the way it takes its plot (as silly as it may sound to today's audiences) with a respect that few works of science fiction (not only films) do. Another of the elements that makes Them! a very special movie, is the way the characters are fleshed out in a very realistic and human form. While basically stereotypes (scientist, cop, government agent, etc...), every one is given enough depth to stand out and become really multi dimensional characters.Experienced b-movie director Gordon Douglas brings the story to life in a sober yet very effective style that at times echoes his work in Westerns and Film Noirs. Just like the script does, Douglas takes the plot of his movie seriously and with a strong basis on reality; creating an atmosphere of dread and a slight dose of pessimism that adds a lot of feeling to the movie. Unlike his imitators, Douglas favors suspense over visual shock, and by hiding the monster during most of the time and giving a really brilliant use to the score and sound effects, he transforms it into a terrifying and very real threat despite his low-budget effects. Combined with the serious take on the plot, this really makes the whole movie be more believable and adds an powerful feeling of impending doom that makes it haunting and truly terrifying.The four actors that give life to the key roles in the film really make the most of the characters they play, starting with James Whitmore, as the county cop whose simple and quiet life gets changed after his discovery in the desert. James Arness is excellent as agent Graham, and shows off the natural talent and charm that would make him a star in Gunsmoke. Joan Weldon is also very good in an atypical (for the 50s) role very ahead of its time. She plays Dr. Pat Medford with a confidence that shows that women can be both beautiful and intelligent. However, the true highlight of the film is the performance done by Edmund Gwenn as Dr. Harold Medford. It is he who gives the film the heart and becomes the basis for the old scientist role of future creature features.Like many movies of its time, Them! has earned a reputation as outdated, silly or worse, badly done movies of a bygone era; however, Them! is a film that offers not only a glimpse of the 50s attitudes, but also an example of a movie that twisted the conventions of its time. While James Arness and Whitmore play the typical archetypes of the hero in this kind of films, they are shown as confused at first, and later afraid of the nature of the beasts they must fight. They are not know-it-all macho men ready to save the world, but everyday people who must learn to overcome their own fears. As written above, Joan Weldon's role was also ahead of its time, and certainly, Edmund Gwenn's role represented the fears of a society afraid of the results of Nuclear testings.I was not expecting a lot of Them!, I mean, the overall concept is really simple, yet the way the movie is crafted makes it one of the most haunting movies of its type ever done.

That being more than anything else, young people want to grow up to be somebody famous. It used to be doctors and firemen that kids wanted to be. Now, everyone wants to be famous. Fame is a story of a group of kids accepted into the High School for Performing Arts in New York City. We seen them first audition, then take classes and learn about life for the next four years. The film has a lot of fine qualities, but ultimately leaves you feeling a little unsatisfied.Alan Parker's bold directorial style fits the story pretty well. The film has been classified as a musical, but more than anything it is a drama. Musical numbers and dance routines break out here and there, and Parker keeps them as close to realistic as they really could have been filmed. The acting is for the most part top-drawer with a few exceptions. The pacing is a little off, particularly toward the end of the film, but by that point, the story has already taken a few wrong turns anyway.First off, the auditions at the beginning of the film should have weeded a couple of the principle characters out. It seems unlikely that anyone would show up and audition for one department, then stumble their way through admissions to another. Some of these people just don't look that talented or interested to begin with. Once the first year of classes gets going, the film settles into a nice groove. The interaction between students and teachers is very well handled, and it leaves you wanting more. The film begins to lose itself later on as we see more and more of the students' lives out of school. Some of these people just aren't worth caring about.The film's biggest mistake is making the Ralph Garcy character so prominent. This guy is a boorish; self-centered jerk. A professional a-hole as he proudly declares on stage during his comedy routines. The audience is supposed to somehow feel for this guy and his tragic personal situation, but I was just hoping they'd throw his butt out of school. Irene Cara, Maureen Teefy, Paul McCrane and the late Gene Anthony Ray are the people you'll care about by the time this film is over. Try as I might, I still can't develop abs like Gene Anthony Ray had in this film.Overall this film is good. It is memorable, interesting, and full of daring scenes and performances.

To be perfectly honest I wasn't quite sure what to make of this film the first time I saw it due to its, for lack of a better term, strangeness but upon repeated viewings the film begins to make sense and you'll begin to appreciate the intricate plotting of Richard Kelly's script, the fine acting of the cast, and the overall excellence of the film Donnie Darko.Jake Gyllenhaal is the one who carries the film and his performance is nothing short of hypnotic to watch. Gyllenhaal is perfect in the role as the weird, troubled, and confused title character. Gyllenhaal never steps out of character and it is his performance that keeps you glued to the screen even during some of the film's weirdest and confusing moments. In short, the talent that he has that would appear during the years that followed this film's release is seen here in an inkling.The rest of the cast is not very far behind Gyllenhaal in terms of their performances. Jena Malone gives a surprising performance as Donnie's girlfriend and she is in many ways the emotional anchor of the film. She is also the source of sanity for Donnie throughout the film as it goes along and even she is drawn into whatever is effecting Donnie. Holmes Osborne and Mary McDonnell play Donnie's parents who seem not to be sure of what to make of their son's unusual hallucinations. Added to the family is Donnie's sisters played by the seemingly innocent Daveigh Chase and with, a nice sense of sibling rivalry, by Gyllenhall's sister Maggie. Add to these appearances by Katharine Ross, Drew Barrymore & Noah Wyle as the authority figures of Donnie's life plus Patrick Swayze as some self-motivator and the highly unusual appearance of Frank (played by James Duval) and you get a spectacular cast.And now onto the script. Richard Kelly has managed to create a script that is both gripping, well-textured, and confusing as hell upon the first viewing (or two). The script is layer upon layer of story, character development, and a plot involving parallel universes and time travel (I think). The script explores issues of acceptance, existence, and everything short of and including the meaning of life. Not east stuff to get the first time around but as I wrote above, repeated viewings makes it easier to understand (plus the fact that Richard Kelly himself has said the film is open to one's own interpretation). In short, the most confusing film script since 2001 A Space Odyssey is the only way I can really describe Donnie Darko.Beyond the script lies a film masterpiece. The film is beautifully photographed from start to finish, starting with the sweeping opening shot of Donnie and ending with the waving between characters at the end of the film. The music score for the film is an interesting combination of well-chosen pop songs (including the opening song Never Tear Us Apart by INXS and the hypnotic Mad World) and a well done score by Michael Andrews to create a hypnotic soundtrack to an hypnotic film. Add to this some weird special effects to Donnie's visions and it is a journey into&#133;well something (as I said this is one of those you figure out what it means films).Overall, Donnie Darko is a masterpiece of modern film-making. With an exceptional performance by Jake Gyllenhaal, fine performances from the rest of the cast, an intricately layered script, beautiful photographed, well scored, and being truly hypnotic, Donnie Darko is a must see for anyone who wants to take a though-provoking two plus hours and go into the unknown. See this as soon as possible. You won't regret it.

To be perfectly honest I wasn't quite sure what to make of this film the first time I saw it due to its, for lack of a better term, strangeness but upon repeated viewings the film begins to make sense and you'll begin to appreciate the intricate plotting of Richard Kelly's script, the fine acting of the cast, and the overall excellence of the film Donnie Darko.Jake Gyllenhaal is the one who carries the film and his performance is nothing short of hypnotic to watch. Gyllenhaal is perfect in the role as the weird, troubled, and confused title character. Gyllenhaal never steps out of character and it is his performance that keeps you glued to the screen even during some of the film's weirdest and confusing moments. In short, the talent that he has that would appear during the years that followed this film's release is seen here in an inkling.The rest of the cast is not very far behind Gyllenhaal in terms of their performances. Jena Malone gives a surprising performance as Donnie's girlfriend and she is in many ways the emotional anchor of the film. She is also the source of sanity for Donnie throughout the film as it goes along and even she is drawn into whatever is effecting Donnie. Holmes Osborne and Mary McDonnell play Donnie's parents who seem not to be sure of what to make of their son's unusual hallucinations. Added to the family is Donnie's sisters played by the seemingly innocent Daveigh Chase and with, a nice sense of sibling rivalry, by Gyllenhall's sister Maggie. Add to these appearances by Katharine Ross, Drew Barrymore & Noah Wyle as the authority figures of Donnie's life plus Patrick Swayze as some self-motivator and the highly unusual appearance of Frank (played by James Duval) and you get a spectacular cast.And now onto the script. Richard Kelly has managed to create a script that is both gripping, well-textured, and confusing as hell upon the first viewing (or two). The script is layer upon layer of story, character development, and a plot involving parallel universes and time travel (I think). The script explores issues of acceptance, existence, and everything short of and including the meaning of life. Not east stuff to get the first time around but as I wrote above, repeated viewings makes it easier to understand (plus the fact that Richard Kelly himself has said the film is open to one's own interpretation). In short, the most confusing film script since 2001 A Space Odyssey is the only way I can really describe Donnie Darko.Beyond the script lies a film masterpiece. The film is beautifully photographed from start to finish, starting with the sweeping opening shot of Donnie and ending with the waving between characters at the end of the film. The music score for the film is an interesting combination of well-chosen pop songs (including the opening song Never Tear Us Apart by INXS and the hypnotic Mad World) and a well done score by Michael Andrews to create a hypnotic soundtrack to an hypnotic film. Add to this some weird special effects to Donnie's visions and it is a journey into&#133;well something (as I said this is one of those you figure out what it means films).Overall, Donnie Darko is a masterpiece of modern film-making.

Now i do play football but trust me my opions is not biased. Well lets start it, i feel that the most important part of either a movie or game is the storyline, if i see some that looks spectacular and it turns to be a either simple or just boring story-line i ignore it. This movie exceeds in all of my expectations. It just took me by complete storm. It start off by putting you right in the action. The coach of the sharks (alpachino) starts trying to get into the head of the other teams coach right away by calling the same play's the other team had been picking up on every play and in doing so the sharks QB takes a severe hit an is injured. Then the 2nd string qb goes in and also gets injured then the 3rd string QB (jami foxx) gets the start. the movie kinda takes its leap from there...i don't wanna spoil anything. From the moment Jamie foxx's character willie the story never goes boring plenty of wicked things happen including a awesome talk at dinner between Willlie and the Coach (alpachino).

In my opinion, he succeeds.The film is at times unsettlingly funny, but by the time it's near the end, Peter Loew has become such a pathetic character that no one's laughing any more. SPOILERS AHEAD The death by staking at the end did not strike me as funny in the least, even though earlier scenes of Loew running around with the plastic fangs in his mouth were a hoot. The character is so basically unlikeable that, when it is obvious he has succumbed to complete madness, it's tragic, but not really moving. The question of how sane he is from the beginning is ambiguous.Whether the Rachel character is a distortion of someone he had a failed relationship with, or perhaps was someone who did not ever return his love to begin with, is hard to say. I think she might be seen as a general representation of all his failed attempts at worthwhile relationships in general.Things that baffle me about this film are ambiguities that include such questions as did he actually rape the secretary? It seems he did, though I'm not sure why. Did he actually kill that woman in the nightclub? Maybe.Did the brother actually kill him? I think so. I am going to propose an idea that may sound absurd, but it's probably no more strange than anything in the movie anyway.I wonder if it's possible that, in spite of all the vampire fantasies about Rachel, Peter Loew is actually in love with Alva, but is either too crazy to realize it, or can't act on it in a normal way. I don't think this totally implausible, partly because there were times I got the feeling she sort of liked him, in a way. His treatment of her is so mean and ultimately violent, that this idea may seem impossible. But if he's a man driven crazy by women rejecting him, it might be that the only way he can respond to a nice, normal woman is to abuse her.This is a very strange movie, which ultimately is not a comedy. People have compared it to Repulsion. I am reminded of Melville's Bartleby the Scrivener, and also George Romero's Martin, about a young man who murders women, believing himself to be a vampire. There is a scene in which Martin puts on a cape and a pair of plastic fangs as a joke to scare his elderly cousin, who believes him to be a genuine, supernatural vampire. I wonder if that movie could have been an influence.The other film I'm reminded of is Scorsese's King of Comedy.This movie is worth seeing at least once, but it's definitely not for everyone. Cage is downright embarrassing to watch at times, which is realistic for the character. He makes a basically hateful character at least interesting, and his descent into madness is all too believable to sustain the humor which often pops up in unlikely places.

The reader may wonder why I don't rate it higher than 8 if I feel that way, but I have reasons.One, the story relies on various conceits to make its point about George's importance to the people around him. Take, for instance, the opening sequence in which George saves his little brother, Harry, from drowning. Later, we learn that Harry grows up to become a WWII hero, winning the Congressional Medal of Honor by saving a troop transport from a kamikaze attack. In Pottersville, however, George's non-existence translates to an unsaved Harry and a transport load of troops sent to Davey Jones' locker. All well and good, but this scenario ignores two things someone else might well have saved Harry's life, and even more significantly, without George, Harry might well have never fallen into the icy pond in the first place. Similar arguments can be made for virtually every other character whose future in Pottersville is radically altered by George's non-being.Two, the film is rife with a certain nostalgic myopia, painting a vision of American life that really never existed outside of a Norman Rockwell painting.Three, it overtly reinforces supernaturalism and irrationality, depending on heavenly intervention to remedy human error.

Otherwise, the rest of the movie has a rather boring look. The setting is kind of fantasy-land Middle-Ages, but the story is right out of Star Wars; there is some rather shameless ripping-off from it going on here. (Obviously, Lord of the Rings is another source.) There is a wise old elf (=Yoda) who talks about the force - without the actual word being used. Then there is the young, short, robot-like Queen with the face of an angel (Birch) who is nothing more than Queen Amidala. Then we have the hero waving a magic thingy and in the last moment deciding not to turn evil like Irons - i.e. Luke and Vader in the finale of Jedi. Then we had that major sword fight between the hero and Irons's right-hand man, which starkly resembled any sword-scene from the Star Wars saga. Then there is a canteen scene with a variety of creatures and humanoids, i.e. the Star Wars Tattooine bar scene. Some other movies also get ripped off, but to a much lesser extent, from what I gather.

We shall continue with the second worst Jeremy Irons. From the very first scene of the movie, we are presented with an Irons who clearly has no idea what he's doing; he is grossly over-playing the evil genius, to the point where it's near-embarrassing to watch him. His grimaces aren't menacing; they are silly, overly manic and amateurish. What he did in the movie wasn't acting but a series of gymnastics exercises for the face. Birch is very cute, but appears little just a little, and is slightly awkward with her imitation of the robotic Queen Amidala.

I can't imagine writer\/director Preston Sturges having done a better job than he does here with this simply marvelous film, easily one of the best of the 1940s and perhaps one of the best ever. Rarely have I felt that a director has made his point as clearly and effectively as Sturges does with this film. He manipulates his audience dexterously but not cheaply.

The irony of course is that in making a film about the value of mindless comedy, Sturges at the same time made a quite important picture that more forcefully addressed the plight of the working man than any number of other films that treated the subject more seriously.I've never liked Joel McCrea better than I do here. His laconic way with a one liner is perfectly suited to Sturges' brand of quick and witty writing. Indeed, the patter comes at you so quickly that your brain may have trouble keeping up with the jokes. Veronica Lake is cute and droll, and she and McCrea get on well together.

For one thing, anyone who has ever played catch with his dad will be very touched by this story.This is pure fantasy and has some schlock, if I'm using the right word, mixed in with some sickeningly-Sixties Liberalism but the good parts are SO good that they far outweigh anything else and make this film one I've always treasured.To me, this movie has many memorable scenes, too many too mention here especially since there are enough reviews already. Suffice to say it's hard to beat those nighttime shots of the ball diamond between the house and cornfield and those mystical moments when the players suddenly appear on the diamond. My favorite character in the movie was Doc Graham, played superbly by Burt Lancaster in the last movie role he ever played, and by Frank Whaley as a younger Archie. Kevin Costner, as Ray Kinsella, the star of the film, is outstanding, too. It's nice to see a guy who knows how to play baseball. Costner is a fine ballplayer in his own right. I didn't care for his wife, Annie, in here, played by Amy Madigan, who supplies us with a lot of the Liberal propaganda with her PTA debate, a few other comments and just the way she sees things, although she is a great wife in here to a husband who appeared to have lost his marbles. She was supportive and loving what more does a husband need?James Earl Jones is good as the former leftist radical who would rather leave his past behind and just extol the virtues of baseball, which he does here expertly. I loved the scene with he and Kevin Costner at Fenway Park in Boston. Ray Liotta, who plays Joe Jackson, became a star because of this movie.Politics aside, this a special movie to anyone who has dreams, yearns at times for the good 'ole days, loves baseball, enjoys a good time-travel-type of story and is a sentimentalist at heart.

It seems that after the first installment of the series, Chucky's potential victim, Andy (Vincent) was placed temporarily into an orphanage while his mother underwent psychiatric evaluation. We learn that police witnesses involved in the first film decided not to press charges against Good Guy Dolls, the company responsible for the manufacturing of toys like Chucky. However, the executives at Good Guy are up in arms over negative tabloid reports and have reassembled Chucky to study it. One thing leads to another, Chucky escapes and goes to find Andy, the one person whose body he can cast himself into by the use of voodoo.Ahh, a time where the Child's Play series was still trying to be scary. I can remember watching Child's Play 2 late at night on USA at a young impressionable age, something which my parents would have prohibited if they had known how determined I was to watch scary movies. Although the movie doesn't do much to frighten me now, this flick scared the crap out of me back then. Chucky becomes much more of a featured character in this sequel. Unlike the first film which opted to keep Chucky in the shadows for most of the first half, we see the character interacting in the environment. While this lessens any tension or mystery about Chucky, it gives Brad Dourif the chance to talk more and spit out continuous one-liners and obscenities. Without Dourif, this movie would have lost major points with me.The special effects in Child's Play 2 are one area in which the production crew topped the original. Especially considering the time in which it was made, it is amazing how they were able to show Chucky walking around and interacting so freely with the environment. His movements are very smooth and realistic. After a while, it is easy to forget that there is even a special effects crew operating the doll.Although movies like this have a reputation for sub par acting, there are actually a few fine performances in Child's Play 2 that stand out. Alex Vincent continues to be effective as Andy Barclay. He comes off very real and avoids any child star overacting, known in my book as Jake Lloydisms. Unfortunately, this time his role doesn't require him to do much more than look concerned, nervous, and sometimes scared. I felt he was much more developed and explored in the original. Also, Jenny Agutter, of An American Werewolf in London fame, gives a strong performance as a caring foster mother.Nevertheless, there is some lousy acting here. While Christine Elise is not bad as Andy's foster sister Kyle, her reactions and overall display of emotion are pretty flat. I mean, the girl doesn't seem to be too blown away by the fact that there is a killer doll trying to kill her. In a scene where Chucky commands her to drive faster, she casually asks him with mild annoyance what his hurry is? I had the same issue with the Good Guy exec that Chucky holds up in the beginning. This is a talking, walking, killing doll that houses the spirit of a dead criminal! Why does this fail to amaze you? Ultimately, this movie fails to live up to the expectations that the original instilled in audiences. Whereas the first movie played like a supernatural crime thriller, Child's Play 2 feels comfortable with settling into pre-existing slasher clichés. The simplistic plot leaves much to be desired. Chucky escapes, finds Andy, causes trouble which gets blamed on Andy, kills some characters which have death written boldly in red on their forehead, and isolates the obvious survivor(s) in a showdown. It's a progression that can be predicted well before viewing. There is also the ever predictable stalk sequence where the protagonist is looking for Chucky, the music is builds to a crescendo, he pulls something aside expecting to see the doll right as the music climaxes, he sees nothing, sighs in a relief to make the audience think he's not there, and then crazy old Chucky dives out from another spot, in effect causing the music to soar to new heights.Also, why are there so many characters that seem out to get Andy? The foster father (Graham) seems only moderately sorry for leaving a Good Guy doll in his adoptive son's closest, even when he knows about Andy's history with the company. OK, I guess we can let that one slip. But does remove the doll from the house? No! Like a jackass, he decides that he can break Andy's irrational fear of the doll by keeping it around the house. Also, the teacher irked me. What kind of person teaches a first grade class like that? I particularly enjoyed the part where she keeps Andy after for detention, something that usually isn't bestowed on children that young. If that wasn't bad enough, she proceeds to lock Andy in the classroom with Chucky while she calls his house. I realize that the actions of these characters exist to advance the plot, but couldn't they have made the characters better-rounded and less static? But all in all, Child's Play 2 isn't a bad movie. It's not great, it doesn't top the original, but it is entertaining as hell. Sure this film had about as many false endings as Lord of the Rings Return of the King, but that seems to be a Chucky tradition. If you are older than fifteen, don't expect to be scared too much. Nevertheless, if you are looking for a light-hearted horror movie with dark humor, you can't go wrong. Brad Dourif as the voice of Chucky alone justifies the price of the DVD purchase or rental.

Unlike the first film which opted to keep Chucky in the shadows for most of the first half, we see the character interacting in the environment. While this lessens any tension or mystery about Chucky, it gives Brad Dourif the chance to talk more and spit out continuous one-liners and obscenities. Without Dourif, this movie would have lost major points with me.The special effects in Child's Play 2 are one area in which the production crew topped the original. Especially considering the time in which it was made, it is amazing how they were able to show Chucky walking around and interacting so freely with the environment. His movements are very smooth and realistic. After a while, it is easy to forget that there is even a special effects crew operating the doll.Although movies like this have a reputation for sub par acting, there are actually a few fine performances in Child's Play 2 that stand out. Alex Vincent continues to be effective as Andy Barclay. He comes off very real and avoids any child star overacting, known in my book as Jake Lloydisms. Unfortunately, this time his role doesn't require him to do much more than look concerned, nervous, and sometimes scared. I felt he was much more developed and explored in the original. Also, Jenny Agutter, of An American Werewolf in London fame, gives a strong performance as a caring foster mother.Nevertheless, there is some lousy acting here. While Christine Elise is not bad as Andy's foster sister Kyle, her reactions and overall display of emotion are pretty flat. I mean, the girl doesn't seem to be too blown away by the fact that there is a killer doll trying to kill her. In a scene where Chucky commands her to drive faster, she casually asks him with mild annoyance what his hurry is? I had the same issue with the Good Guy exec that Chucky holds up in the beginning. This is a talking, walking, killing doll that houses the spirit of a dead criminal! Why does this fail to amaze you? Ultimately, this movie fails to live up to the expectations that the original instilled in audiences. Whereas the first movie played like a supernatural crime thriller, Child's Play 2 feels comfortable with settling into pre-existing slasher clichés. The simplistic plot leaves much to be desired. Chucky escapes, finds Andy, causes trouble which gets blamed on Andy, kills some characters which have death written boldly in red on their forehead, and isolates the obvious survivor(s) in a showdown. It's a progression that can be predicted well before viewing. There is also the ever predictable stalk sequence where the protagonist is looking for Chucky, the music is builds to a crescendo, he pulls something aside expecting to see the doll right as the music climaxes, he sees nothing, sighs in a relief to make the audience think he's not there, and then crazy old Chucky dives out from another spot, in effect causing the music to soar to new heights.Also, why are there so many characters that seem out to get Andy? The foster father (Graham) seems only moderately sorry for leaving a Good Guy doll in his adoptive son's closest, even when he knows about Andy's history with the company. OK, I guess we can let that one slip. But does remove the doll from the house? No! Like a jackass, he decides that he can break Andy's irrational fear of the doll by keeping it around the house. Also, the teacher irked me. What kind of person teaches a first grade class like that? I particularly enjoyed the part where she keeps Andy after for detention, something that usually isn't bestowed on children that young. If that wasn't bad enough, she proceeds to lock Andy in the classroom with Chucky while she calls his house. I realize that the actions of these characters exist to advance the plot, but couldn't they have made the characters better-rounded and less static? But all in all, Child's Play 2 isn't a bad movie. It's not great, it doesn't top the original, but it is entertaining as hell. Sure this film had about as many false endings as Lord of the Rings Return of the King, but that seems to be a Chucky tradition. If you are older than fifteen, don't expect to be scared too much. Nevertheless, if you are looking for a light-hearted horror movie with dark humor, you can't go wrong. Brad Dourif as the voice of Chucky alone justifies the price of the DVD purchase or rental. ","genre":"Fantasy, Horror"},{"date":"10 January 2007","score":"","review":" In Child's Play 2 we see the return of Chucky, a doll possessed by the soul of Chicago killer Charles Lee Ray (Dourif). It seems that after the first installment of the series, Chucky's potential victim, Andy (Vincent) was placed temporarily into an orphanage while his mother underwent psychiatric evaluation. We learn that police witnesses involved in the first film decided not to press charges against Good Guy Dolls, the company responsible for the manufacturing of toys like Chucky. However, the executives at Good Guy are up in arms over negative tabloid reports and have reassembled Chucky to study it. One thing leads to another, Chucky escapes and goes to find Andy, the one person whose body he can cast himself into by the use of voodoo.Ahh, a time where the Child's Play series was still trying to be scary.

But, like it or not, Pulp Fiction opens the door for other movies that contains one or more of its formulas to either be enjoyable, or have higher rating, or be looked cool, or even be popular. Those formulas are (I cannot mention all of them)1) Short Stories Plots. Pulp Fiction is just like a book that contains short stories where each has their own plot. All the stories are connected one to another by the similarity of characters and incidents. There are stories of a couple who wanted to rob a restaurant, a gangster's wife and a hit-man's trip, two hit men's silly experience, and a runaway boxer hunted by gangster. They all happens around the gangster's environment. The time line of those stories doesn't have to be time wise, which means the story that happens first doesn't have to be the first to be told. Maybe Pulp Fiction is not the first movie, but later, many movie uses this kind of plot and become successful. There are Amores Perros, Babel, Antares, Sin City, Kill Bill, Intermission, The Dead Girl, Berbagi Suami, and many others with their own variation. Later, one of the variations called 'post-modern plot'. Maybe they don't have any intention to use the same formula or they doesn't even inspired by Pulp Fiction, for example, Chungking Express launched a little bit sooner than Pulp Fiction. But, it is Pulp Fiction who opens the door for them, it makes easier for others to be enjoyable.2)Many stories with different Point of View. In each of its stories, Pulp Fiction has a point of view of the third person (audience) that follows the main character. This kind of formula was already popular in the novel, long time before Pulp Fiction, Jeffrey Archer and even Sydney Sheldon wrote this kind of point of view. After Pulp Fiction, many popular movies use the same formula successfully, like The Hours, Crash, 21 grams, Syriana, Traffic, and many others including those're mentioned before. Again, Pulp Fiction just opens the door. 3)Satire to violence. Pulp Fiction is a satire to violence. Quentin Tarantino has always been making satire to violence movies, even sooner when he wrote True Romance a year before. He always makes violence look funny in a dark way, to some people who can enjoy it. After Pulp Fiction, there are movies like Lock, Stock, and 2 Smoking Barrels, Snatch, Cidade de Seus, Brick, Shawn of the Dead, Desperado, etc. 4)Independent Spirit. It is true that Stanley Kubrick has made indie movie long long time before Pulp Fiction. But, Independent Movies have never looked that cool before Pulp Fiction, and later, all the Kubrick's are looked even cooler than before.I love Pulp Fiction. Even it might not be my number 1 movie, but I have a great great respect and appreciation for it.
