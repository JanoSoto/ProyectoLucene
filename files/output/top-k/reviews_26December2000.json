[{"date":"26 December 2000","score":"","review":"  I mistakenly rated this movie 7 instead of 6.As an aspiring professional poker player (legitimate; in casinos), I found this movie to be very ENTERTAINING.  I capitalize ENTERTAINING because that does not comment on its artistic integrity.The following notes describe what is right with the movieJohn Malkovich, Edward Norton, John Turturro and Martin Landau, need I say more?  Landau, Turturro and Malkovich perform on par, which is about three levels up from on par for many other actors.  Norton creates a character that is lovable and familiar.  Though perhaps many people who see the movie won't have a best friend who screws up quite as much as Worm (Norton), no one has a perfect best friend.  His humanity shows through in every move he makes.The visual aspects of this movie attributed to lighting and production design are phenomenal.  There is a scene early in the movie in which Mike (Matt Damon) and Joey (John Turturro) are standing on the sidewalk that takes my breath away every time I see it despite having watched the movie twenty or more times.The plot is excellent, providing the audience with a sense of tension despite the movie's Hollywood production.  Hollywood production leads the audience to the knowledge that everything will be ok and the status quo will be maintained by the end of the movie, as far as I'm concerned.Rounders is accessible enough that upon watching it, the audience is playing all the hands that Mike (Matt Damon) is playing and winning and losing with him.The things that are wrong with the movie are as followsGretchen Mol.  She couldn't act her way out of a cardboard box.There is one specific time (if you're not a serious poker player, you won't understand anyway) when Damon seems to misunderstand, or perhaps not understand at all what he is saying in terms of poker parlance.  This event falls in a voiceover at a major turning point in the movie, thereby cheapening the voiceover's effect if you do understand what he means.The end is predictable.  I won't say any more than that in the interest of not giving away the story to anyone who has not seen it.At the beginning of the movie, there is a piece of writing and\/or direction that is bothersome Teddy KGB (Malkovich) walks away from the poker table having just turned over a hand as if it couldn't have been beaten.  The fact is that he holds the second best hand possible and that Mike (Matt Damon) holds the third best possible hand.  Again, to the layman, this fact is likely not a problem, but to me, the scene was clearly artificial in that Malkovich's character walks away from the table as if he couldn't have been beaten when in fact, he could have been.  A minor inconsistency, but a problem to the aficionado.Overall recommendationsIf you're a poker player who has read more than a few books on the subject, see the movie, but don't expect it to dazzle you in terms of its poker savvy.  If you've never played poker, watch it and enjoy it despite the whole Hollywood thing.  If you play poker at home with your friends recreationally, watch the movie, it may teach you something about how to play the game.  If you don't like poker or are a gambling addict, don't watch the movie; it makes you want to play poker.  If you like independent films and play poker less than once a year, don't watch this movie; you'll think its trash.

On the other hand, if you have already seen this movie, spoilers don't make any difference and if you have not seen it, spoilers may not make any difference either because I very much recommend that you don't bother wasting your time to see it anyway.Considering the hype that Gladiator had before, during, and after its release to the theaters, this had to be one of my worst disappointments.  The good guy-bad guy situation was so obvious that I think all the people involved with making this movie must have been too close to it to see what they were doing.  Either that, or they thought viewers were all stupid.  A little character development might have helped here.This movie is basically about two guys.  One is General Maximus something that ends with an s, something else that ends with an s, and he is a really, really good guy.  Then there is the son of the emperor, something that begins with a C and ends with an s, who is a really, really bad guy.  How do we know this?  The movie's first major scene is the general bravely leading his troops into battle (and fighting hand-to-hand himself, which seems dumb for the commanding general), and wins a great victory.  He then shows his fine personal side by having a heart-to-heart with the emperor.  General Maximus says he now wants to go home to his wife and kid and there is a gooey filmover that shows the audience what a nice family life he has.  His boss tells him that he wants the general to take over leadership of Rome since the emperor is about to die.  The good general goes away to think about it.  Then the emperor's son comes in and finds out this distressing information when he talks to his dad.  Naturally, he then murders his father so he can lead Rome himself.  What a bad guy he is!The general is awakened to find this out and examines the body so as to determine that he had indeed been murdered.  Things get worse for the general when the naughty son orders him executed.  A bunch of the son's soldiers then take the luckless general away.  They promptly botch the execution, however, when the general with his hands tied and unarmed somehow kills everyone.  The general then rushes home, but gets there too late and discovers that his family have been horribly tortured and killed and the farm burned.  Can the son get even worse and the general even better?  In this movie, the answer is yes, of course.The general is then captured and placed into slavery and made a gladiator in order to please the blood-thirsty people.  He then makes an amazing recovery to kill about a zillion other gladiators who have no redeeming characteristics.  The son implements his plan to lead the people by hitting on his own sister, making advances to his nephew, and planning 150 days of killing to cement his loving bond with his countrymen.  This guy is definetly no George Washington.While this is all going on, we movie viewers are treated to some of the silliest special effects ever.  In one scene, an ordinary chariot explodes when crashing into the side of the stadium.  In another, tigers pop out of the middle of the stadium to try to kill the already hopelessly overmatched gladiators.  Nothing works and the slave-gladiator continues to mess up the son's plans by killing everybody he faces.  Even the only undefeated gladiator in Roman history (remember when defeated, a gladiator is dead) is coaxed out of five-year retirement to come back and be easily killed by the indestructible general.The movie's ending is still more rediculous.  For historical accuracy, all the people in the movie, including the slaves, have perfect teeth, look clean despite impossible conditions of sanitation, and are so well fed that a few look overweight.

I, who actually always had not understood why so many people like this film a lot better then The Empire strikes Back finally understood it. I mean I had seen this film about seven or eight times before, but when I saw it again, I realized what a great film this is. I'd immediately have given it a ten out of ten if it wouldn't have been for the beginning of the film, which I think sucks a bit. First of all I do not like that singing performance in the beginning that much, but that is not what bothered me. What really bothered me were the bad, bad, bad effects in the Rancor vs. Luke fighting scene. The bad effects draw all the attention to them than to focus it on the action and that was so bad no 10 can ever be given by me to this film. Apart from that this film is just one enormous accumulation of excitement, fun, action, emotion, surprises and twists which will not let you out of it's grip until the end. All this is held together by the performances of the great cast of Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Peter Mayhew (Chewbacca), Anthony Daniels (C-3PO), Kenny Baker (R2-D2), Billy Dee Williams (Lando) , Clive Revill (Emperor Palpatine) and the Voice of James Earl Jones as Darth Vader. As you may have noticed during my other reviews I really like Harrison Ford as Han Solo most but I must say my other personal favorite is Carrie Fisher as the Princess who does not mind to get her hands dirty. This (again) does not mean I do not like the other characters, as a matter of fact I like them all, but these two have the biggest amount of memorable scenes together. My other favorite pair in this trilogy (mostly due to this film) would (of course) be Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker.Now, to not bore you more with my views on this trilogy I'd like to say something about the whole Saga. It actually is more or less aimed at George Lucas and all the original cast of Star Wars, but they'll never read it anyway so here it goes. With the prequel Trilogy taking it's form as we speak there is an enormous hope going around Star Wars fans everywhere that Lucas will also do the last Trilogy. Lucas himself though said that he won't do it and it has been also said by other participants of this Trilogy that they won't return. Let me give you my view on it. In my opinion, opening weekends and box &#150; office results have shown there still is an interest in the Star Wars stories and regarding that one is probably safe suggesting that people would go and see the last Trilogy too. I mean, The Return of the Jedi is a good ending of an epic story, but the fact there is more, makes me wonder what more there could be to the story and I must admit, I need to know how it continues. So in my opinion Lucas should have a poll on his Star Wars site on whether or not the public wants to see the last Trilogy as well. If the outcome is yes he should polish up the story and go to all of his original cast (Fisher, Hamill and Ford) and ask them to return for their roles, for I presume the crowd wants to see their old heroes back on the screen. I mean I would understand it if Lucas said he doesn't want to do it, but maybe the fact that the people want to see his stuff without even knowing what it is about, makes him feel so honored that he'll do it anyway. Plus, I mean with the technology of this day, he could shoot all three films back to back (as was done with the Lord of the Rings Trilogy) and he would be done fast, rather than spending more than 6 years on the whole Trilogy. As for the original cast, I could understand them, if they do not want to return, I mean for they all do not need the money, but it would be nice to see them again in the roles that made them famous. I am not going to say now that they owe it to the audience to return as Leia, Luke and Han to the big screen, because the audience watches their films, buys their books and stuff. No, I won't and you know why? Because that is not true they don't owe us anything. They do what they like and we watch it if we like and that's it. We want to be entertained and they provide us with entertainment. I mean it is not like fame has served all of the stars of this Trilogy well (except maybe for Ford) and we have to respect that too. It is their life and not ours and so it is up to them if they want to re &#150; enter that Star Wars frenzy or not. Cause a frenzy it is. All I do hope, is that Lucas really thinks about making the third Trilogy of the Star Wars saga and I also hope all of the other &#145;original' cast and crew members do the same, because I want to see the ending of an epic story, knowing that all the people I &#145;know' worked on it.Watch, be surprised, entertained, sad and jolly.May the force be with you&#133;&#133;&#133;&#133;&#133;&#133;&#133;&#133;always.9 out of 10 ","genre":null},{"date":"26 December 2000","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  happened when I saw this movie again.

I am not going to say now that they owe it to the audience to return as Leia, Luke and Han to the big screen, because the audience watches their films, buys their books and stuff. No, I won't and you know why? Because that is not true they don't owe us anything. They do what they like and we watch it if we like and that's it.

I, who actually always had not understood why so many people like this film a lot better then The Empire strikes Back finally understood it. I mean I had seen this film about seven or eight times before, but when I saw it again, I realized what a great film this is. I'd immediately have given it a ten out of ten if it wouldn't have been for the beginning of the film, which I think sucks a bit. First of all I do not like that singing performance in the beginning that much, but that is not what bothered me. What really bothered me were the bad, bad, bad effects in the Rancor vs. Luke fighting scene. The bad effects draw all the attention to them than to focus it on the action and that was so bad no 10 can ever be given by me to this film. Apart from that this film is just one enormous accumulation of excitement, fun, action, emotion, surprises and twists which will not let you out of it's grip until the end. All this is held together by the performances of the great cast of Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Peter Mayhew (Chewbacca), Anthony Daniels (C-3PO), Kenny Baker (R2-D2), Billy Dee Williams (Lando) , Clive Revill (Emperor Palpatine) and the Voice of James Earl Jones as Darth Vader. As you may have noticed during my other reviews I really like Harrison Ford as Han Solo most but I must say my other personal favorite is Carrie Fisher as the Princess who does not mind to get her hands dirty. This (again) does not mean I do not like the other characters, as a matter of fact I like them all, but these two have the biggest amount of memorable scenes together. My other favorite pair in this trilogy (mostly due to this film) would (of course) be Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker.Now, to not bore you more with my views on this trilogy I'd like to say something about the whole Saga. It actually is more or less aimed at George Lucas and all the original cast of Star Wars, but they'll never read it anyway so here it goes. With the prequel Trilogy taking it's form as we speak there is an enormous hope going around Star Wars fans everywhere that Lucas will also do the last Trilogy. Lucas himself though said that he won't do it and it has been also said by other participants of this Trilogy that they won't return. Let me give you my view on it. In my opinion, opening weekends and box &#150; office results have shown there still is an interest in the Star Wars stories and regarding that one is probably safe suggesting that people would go and see the last Trilogy too. I mean, The Return of the Jedi is a good ending of an epic story, but the fact there is more, makes me wonder what more there could be to the story and I must admit, I need to know how it continues. So in my opinion Lucas should have a poll on his Star Wars site on whether or not the public wants to see the last Trilogy as well. If the outcome is yes he should polish up the story and go to all of his original cast (Fisher, Hamill and Ford) and ask them to return for their roles, for I presume the crowd wants to see their old heroes back on the screen. I mean I would understand it if Lucas said he doesn't want to do it, but maybe the fact that the people want to see his stuff without even knowing what it is about, makes him feel so honored that he'll do it anyway. Plus, I mean with the technology of this day, he could shoot all three films back to back (as was done with the Lord of the Rings Trilogy) and he would be done fast, rather than spending more than 6 years on the whole Trilogy. As for the original cast, I could understand them, if they do not want to return, I mean for they all do not need the money, but it would be nice to see them again in the roles that made them famous.

I expected a decent look into the challenges of living in utter isolation, having to survive without modern acoutrements, and a lot of reflection on one's place in the universe. Oh no. This film, whenever confronted with the option, chooses the road of superficiality over depth.Once we get past the deeply Republican yuppie fantasy of ideal existence and onto the island, we would expect, at least after a while, a little reflection on the part of our protagonist. But, for a film whose star is so eager to declare that nothing happens in its middle section, we are treated to unending survival tips and adventures at the expense of any reflection. This is a beautiful island, surely anyone there would have some moments of appreciating the stillness and natural wonder of the island. Well, not here. Surely after four years Hanks would have developed his own ways, his own joys and sorrows, new abilities he's proud of, or good at, but we just don't see them. His emotional range remains, for the whole of the island portion of the film, sad and sadder. We're supposed to believe that after he returns to civilization that there's a part of him left on that island-- well, based on this movie, he never really seems to BE on the island, he's always a yuppie visitor, and doesn't seem to engage in his environment. This movie could have been much more powerful if it chose to really engage in the loneliness and despair that one would feel after giving up on civilization and realizing one may be alone for the rest of one's life. Hanks is a fine actor unhampered by vanity, but here what we're seeing is a movie star dropped off on a set every morning. The movie's depth never rises above the level of Dude, what if you were like, trapped on an island? Man, like, what would you DO? That would sure suck. And that's the one statement this film seems to make being alone in the universe pretty much sucks. Hey, Thanks Tom, you're giving us pearls.There are a lot of other details that give the film away as a sham. If I was standed on a tropical island, the first thing I would do is look for the resort on the other side. Tom shouts a few Hello's, then assumes that there's no one there. At one point he climbs up to the summit--at this point a 360-degree pan could have worked wonders, but uh-uh, not here. I still think there's a Club Med a half-mile away that Tom just never bothered to look for. He also never really seems to explore the island--and after four years, don't you think you'd take a little field trip? Also, after four years, wouldn't you have built yourself more than a few spears? Tom can't get off the island because of the reef off the section of beach he refuses to leave--maybe he could have paddled around to see if there was a break in the reef? Oh, I guess not. This is what I mean when I say this film never really engages with the reality of being on the island, and robs itself of the seriousness it so desperately asks of its audience.I have read a book of true accounts of people stranded on islands (Great Shipwrecks and Castaways, it's still in print, and it's excellent, so look for it if this interests you), and a book on how to survive if you must drift for days on a raft, and I know that the real problem Tom is going to face once his portasan blows away is exposure to the sun. But that problem is apparently not convenient for this film to explore, so it just pretends like it doesn't exist. This film asks you to reflect only on the problems of nature that Hollywood can easily solve, all others simply do not exist.A SPOILER IN THIS NEXT SECTION But the real mistake this movie makes, in which it betrays both itself and its audience, is to virtually cancel out ALL emotional resonance it might have attained by having a hot babe appear out of nowhere in the final two minutes to make everything okay. This development is at once disappointing and disgusting. Disappointing in that all the sadness we've built up for Hanks is INSTANTLY ERADICATED by the convenient appearance of a new chick to make his life complete, disgusting in the suggestion that Helen Hunt's character, who we've built up such a respect and reverence for, can simply be replaced by an almost identical hot chick (this one has RED hair though! And besides, Hunt never amounted to much anyway). So, as an audience, we are left to assume that Hank's character really IS stupifyingly superficial, and that the only connection he really had to Hunt, all that time on the island, is that he needed some babe in his life. Hunt, or someone else, it doesn't matter. This puts a nasty taste in my mouth now when I think about Hanks and Zemeckis as PEOPLE. But aside from that, I am surprised that they would so completely betray the film they've obviously expended so much effort on. All in all, a deeply Republican film. It prods us to look deep inside ourselves and ask What would we do if one day we didn't have an SUV and a pager? But, the movie says, don't worry about not having a woman around, they're a dime a dozen, and they're all the same.

It follows the book very closely to my recollection and in general is one my top ten films of the year.  However, to those who have not read the book, it may be hard to get a real feel for the characters and really get into the movie.  Aside from the previously mentioned, praise should go to Damon who gives the performance of his career, and if not for one of the more competitive years for lead actor, would be a sure in for an oscar nod.  I also have to rave about the cinematography. Unfortunately, early reviews of the film forced there to be some serious cuts here, but it still holds its own nicely.

He hit it dead on... you couldn't ask for any more realism, and I also think this is probably the first film of his where he actually cries.  If this wasn't an Oscar-caliber performance, I don't know what one is.Do yourself a favor and read the book before you see this film.  Otherwise there will be no way that you will either understand it or what the director was trying to pull off.

SHAME, SHAME, SHAME on you for marketing the home video of this very important film as if it were a soft-core sex romp. The original artwork for the film captured its essence very well (the soundtrack on CD has the original artwork), but the VHS video box cover on the front shows Mimi Rogers looking like she had the biggest...well, you know...sexual thrill of her life. The back cover shows a shirtless David Duchovny (but with a look on his face like a deer caught in the headlights). The cover says exploring a woman's sexual and spiritual awakening. Excuse me, but Mimi Rogers' character seems to already be well educated in sex by revealing that she likes to swing with friend Patrick Bauchau. Sure, there is some sex in the first part of the film, but the story as a whole is 95% about the spiritual part. I'd love to yell at the person who got the job of marketing that cover and say how it really is an insult to people's intelligence in general. The Current DVD cover unfortunately makes it look like a religious family film...a big mistake. Should have kept the original artwork (again, see the soundtrack CD cover for that).NOW, for the praise. The Rapture is one of those rare films that refuses to compromise and doesn't apologize if it offends one's religious beliefs. Mimi Rogers is a telephone operator with a very unremarkable life. Even her sexual experiences with her friend seem to be boring her. She eventually overhears co-workers talking about The Boy and she is intrigued by the secrecy surrounding him. She eventually gets involved with this religious group and as time passes, gets married, has a daughter, and continues her religious life. Then things get a bit....bizarre. It leads to a conclusion that may anger those who are devout and get a a lot of respect from those that feel there are many things we just shouldn't settle for in our existence.I'm not an Academy Award nut, but the fact that Mimi Rogers was overlooked for a nomination is sacrilege...excuse me, but in reviewing something like this film some puns are inevitable! The one scene that most everyone I know refers to specifically is the one where Mimi confesses a crime to policeman Will Patton on the side of a road. Watching her emotional pain as she cries out how she can't love God anymore tears me up every time I see it, and it leaves you in a weakened state for the rest of the film. And the rest of the film will have you in a state of amazement right through to its fade. I was so impressed by the uncompromising conclusion and while some may feel that maybe Mimi didn't really win in the end, I feel she did. I too want to know why people think God solely has us here to worship, worship, worship -- at one point Mimi even asks co-workers Isn't that a bit selfish? While we don't get the answers we seek in this film, at least it challenges our minds and gets us talking. I can't recall any other film that has an effect to such an extent as The Rapture. Whether you are very serious in your religious beliefs or are open to all sides of discussion, The Rapture will unnerve, exhilarate, and leave you truly touched in some way.

One can live vicariously in the Burton world upon listening to the soundtrack alone.The first time I saw the film, my initial thought (as an aspiring young music theatre actor) was that this would be a great Broadway show; however, I realized that the interpretation from stop motion animation to live action would have to lose something.Tim Burton fans have likely already seen this movie, however, many of us may have been put off by the fact that Michael Eisner footed the bill.  If you're a Tim Burton fan and you haven't seen this movie, do yourself the service of seeing it.  There are some familiar items in this movie  (i.e. the black and white color scheme from Beetlejuice and Sleepy Hollow, and the black and white striped worm from Beetlejuice) that  you'll enjoy seeing. You'll also just plain enjoy the movie.If you're a human being and you haven't seen this movie, do yourself the favor see this movie.  If you're a human being and you have seen this movie, do yourself the favor see it again.

Pulp Fiction can be seen as a date and Jackie Brown as a marriage.Reservoir Dogs is the brief, sweet first kiss that leaves you exhilarated, a little unsure of yourself and finds you walking away with images in your head and blood pumping in your ears.  I like this film.The editing is concise and flows as effortlessly as the dialogue, with the flashback structure providing a foundation for the actual real-time scene in the warehouse, it actually works better than I expected when I first saw this movie.The cast is as uniformly magnificent as the blacksuits the professionals wear with a stand-up performance from Steve Buscemi as the misanthropic Mr Pink ( who, by the way, DOESN'T tip) a menace to coffee shop waitresses everywhere.This film has faced charges from critics that it is nihilistic and misogynistic, neither of which holds any weight.It is a modern moral story, with traditional themes of the gangster film; success, failure, loyalty and betrayal.  As one line on the British VHS box states the best case for going straight.Women have no real place in this film, they don't belong.  Add a woman and the film changes dramatically.  The professionals are lonely men who feel that the women circle outside their zone of existence.  This is seen in the number of references to them in the film.  For a misogynistic film they sure talk about women a lot.There is not a great deal of violence in this film, but the violence is REAL, something cinema goers are not used to.  The violence is slow, loud, painful and with consequences that the characters have to deal with.Reservoir Dogs is not film noir, nor is it neo-film noir.  It is postmodern film noir, edgy, slick, controversial and very subjective.  Watch this film once and you will enjoy it, watch this film more than once more than once and you will see things you didn't see before.  Go on...
