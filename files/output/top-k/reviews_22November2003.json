I'm not a prude by any means...but honestly this movie was just a little weird for me.  Call me uncultured, lacking in taste...I really don't care.

No cheesy dialouge, ooey gooey feelings or Oh, I hope they get together in the ends.  It was hilarious from start to finish, in that great why do I feel embarrassed when it's not happening to me kinda way.Hugh Grant was perfectly cast.  Only he could make such an unlikeable character strangely likeable.  I've loved Toni Colette since Muriels Wedding and her depressive, if not near psychopathic tendancies portrayed in the movie do not dissapoint.  The beautiful Rachel Weiss could have been written into the script a little more, and three cheers for the actor portraying Marcus.  I thought I had it bad as a child. I'm not going to ramble on and on like I do for movies that were just awful, because I don't want to ruin any aspect of the movie for someone deciding to rent it.  It's definatley worth seeing.  Even my boyfriend who groaned when I brought it home was laughing and singing Shake yo ass, watch yoself, shake yo ass, show me what your workin with by the end of the movie.  Skip the crap thats in the theaters right now, and rent About a Boy. )     ","genre":null},{"date":"22 November 2003","score":"","review":"  I thought this was going to be a romantic comedy, but thank God it wasn't.
