So despite what bad reviews I heard regarding this movie, when it came out, I decided to go.  I dragged my two friends and we set out for the only theater in our small college town.  Had I know that it was more about witchcraft than a romantic comedy, I probably would have waited to rent it on video, but once in the theater it was too late.  And when the movie was over, I hate to say it, but I was sadly disappointed.  Luckily, at this small theater we only had to shell out $3.50 for a Sunday afternoon matinee, anything more would have been a crime. Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman work wonderfully together on stage as sisters, Sally and Gillian Owens, who are raised by their two aunts, Frances (Stockard Channing) and Jet (Dianne Wiest), as young children, after the death of their parents.  The girls come from a long line of witches, and the sisters, especially the younger, Sally, have received this special gift of magic.  The girls grow up with their aunts in a carefree environment having fun and learning spells.  The only problem is that years ago, a curse was put on all Owens women, saying that all men they truly love will die before their time. The sisters, as young adults, both try to escape their magical background in different ways.  Gillian, the wilder of the two runs off and spends her time with different men, while Sally searches for a normal life.  Sally, with the help of her Aunts, marries and has two girls of her own, which have a striking resemblance to her and her sister.  But their magic free life changes when Gillian meets one man whose presence brings on a chain of events that the sisters must handle together.  This results in the addition of a new character, Officer Gary Hallet (Adian Quinn), who enters not only the story, but also the hearts of the characters and the audience alike. This movie has all the elements of a four star flick; talented cast, good themes, great music and fantastic cinematography.  Love, romance, relationships, friendship, family values, acceptance, and murder are all thrown together with a little witchcraft to create the story.  And the movie probably would have been a success if it were not for one thing the script. I have not read the book, but I feel that many of the details of the story were missing and that questions were left unanswered.  This is because too many sub-plots were going on at once and as soon as the audience got involved in one, another would arise and there was no closure to the previous plot.

","genre":null},{"date":"9 November 1998","score":"","review":"  Ever since I saw the preview for Practical Magic, I couldn't wait till it came to theaters so I could go see it with my friends.  So despite what bad reviews I heard regarding this movie, when it came out, I decided to go.  I dragged my two friends and we set out for the only theater in our small college town.  Had I know that it was more about witchcraft than a romantic comedy, I probably would have waited to rent it on video, but once in the theater it was too late.  And when the movie was over, I hate to say it, but I was sadly disappointed.  Luckily, at this small theater we only had to shell out $3.50 for a Sunday afternoon matinee, anything more would have been a crime. Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman work wonderfully together on stage as sisters, Sally and Gillian Owens, who are raised by their two aunts, Frances (Stockard Channing) and Jet (Dianne Wiest), as young children, after the death of their parents.  The girls come from a long line of witches, and the sisters, especially the younger, Sally, have received this special gift of magic.  The girls grow up with their aunts in a carefree environment having fun and learning spells.  The only problem is that years ago, a curse was put on all Owens women, saying that all men they truly love will die before their time. The sisters, as young adults, both try to escape their magical background in different ways.  Gillian, the wilder of the two runs off and spends her time with different men, while Sally searches for a normal life.  Sally, with the help of her Aunts, marries and has two girls of her own, which have a striking resemblance to her and her sister.  But their magic free life changes when Gillian meets one man whose presence brings on a chain of events that the sisters must handle together.  This results in the addition of a new character, Officer Gary Hallet (Adian Quinn), who enters not only the story, but also the hearts of the characters and the audience alike. This movie has all the elements of a four star flick; talented cast, good themes, great music and fantastic cinematography.  Love, romance, relationships, friendship, family values, acceptance, and murder are all thrown together with a little witchcraft to create the story.  And the movie probably would have been a success if it were not for one thing the script. I have not read the book, but I feel that many of the details of the story were missing and that questions were left unanswered.  This is because too many sub-plots were going on at once and as soon as the audience got involved in one, another would arise and there was no closure to the previous plot.

This 1940 production of The MARK OF ZORRO is the most handsomely turned-out version of this tale of old California.  Like the SCARLET PIMPERNEL, it is a tale of hidden identity, and of good over evil.Tyrone Power plays Don Diego de la Vega, the scion of well-to-do California family.  Away in Madrid at some Academy of war-fare, he is summoned home by his worried father to aid the good people of the region against an oppressive regime that has seized political power.  As the ruthless and dangerous Basil Rathbone  silkily informs Don Diego when he first returns, Your father has resigned, Don Diego,.......age you know.  Since then the peons have become more industrious.  As for the caballeros, they are encouraged to think of their own affairs....WE TAKE CARE OF THE GOVERNMENT!Sizing up the situation and not wanting to tip his hand, Don Diego retreats into the persona of a fop and dandy.  This device contributes to much of the film's witty and extremely humorous fun. The beauty here is that we are the only ones let-in on this charade.  Don Diego begins on a campaign to frighten the puppet governor, Don Luis Quintero into fleeing to Madrid and appointing the older Vega (his father)to the post.  He does this by staging little terrorist attacks on soldiers and caravans.  But the biggest obstacle to his plans is the real power behind the throne ---- Capitan Estaban Pasquale, wonderfully portrayed by Basil Rathbone.  This is real conflict in this movie.On one side we have Don Diego; cuffs of lace, snuff box in hand, and eternally fatigued. He enters a room, Sorry I'm late, but they heated the water for my bath too early.  It was postively tepid! By the time more was carried and properly scented (sigh)..... Life can be trying....don't you think?  He postures and prances, forever exhibiting, to anyone who'll watch, some slight of hand.  It's all the rage at Court, ... oh how I'll miss the scented breezes of Spain!  But the piercing presence of Capitan Estaban Pasquale is never far off.  Here is Basil Rathbone;  his knife-life figure and his compelling voice steal the show.  As Don Luis observes, My dear Estaban is forever thrusting at this or that, he was a fencing master in Madrid. Aside from his skill with a sword, he is smart.  He grills Don Luis (after one fo Zorro's nocturnal visits); Well, what did he look like, what did he say? When he finds out that Zorro wants Don Luis to retire and to name Vega in his place, Estaban draws his eppe and begins making wicked thrusts and swipes with it as he says, Ah Ha! Now we've got something! This Zorro is a Caballero!  No ordinary brigand would concern himself with Vega! This guy's quick.The final Dueling scene between Don Diego and Estaban is the very best in movies..... compelling and breathtaking.  Estaban, grabbing a blubbering Don Luis, on the verge of quitting, by the collar, So you tried to get gold out of the country, did you?  If you ever again take so much as one peso of mine I'll cut or throat from ear-to-ear!!  He turns on Don Diego, Quiet you poppenjay, I have very little reason for letting you live either!  Soon the duel begins.  As graceful as a ballet, quick and razor-like.Of course good triumphs.  There is much to like about this movie.

Sheryl Lee spends the remainder of the film being slapped, punched, bound, gagged, writhing and twitching--one of the most degrading performances by an actress in a film this year.

The misogynistic streak in the film disturbed me. A young priest, Father Adam, joins the crew, giving Crow another target for abuse. James Woods has all the charm of an irritable scorpion. Thomas Ian Griffith isn't given enough to do. He certainly does make a menacing and imposing Master Vampire. Sexy in a feral sort of way. I would like to have seen back story on Valek. All in all, an interesting, but flawed film. ","genre":"Action, Horror, Thriller"},{"date":"9 November 1998","score":"","review":"  Ok. let's set this up. You've got a group of Vatican sponsored vampire slayers led by Jack Crow (James Woods), a man with enough attitude for you, for me, for all of us. He and his crew clean out a nest but miss the Master Vampire, Valek (Thomas Ian Griffith). The crew goes back to the Sun God Motel and settles in for a serious night of partying with whores and booze (also paid for by the Vatican and supplied by local law enforcement). An unhappy Valek comes calling. He pauses long enough to bite one of the whores, Katrina (Sheryl Lee), who finds the experience VERY pleasurable. He then proceeds to massacre the crew, only Jack Crow and Montoya (Daniel Baldwin, in a sleep-acting tour de force) escape.
