UNIVERSAL SOLDIER THE RETURN is perhaps one of the most fun action packed sequels ever made! The film is a non stop barrage of martial arts showdowns, gun fights & explosions & some pretty impressive stunts. Literally form first frame till last, UNIVERSAL SOLDIER THE RETURN's action comes fast & furious, staying constantly in you're face until the film is over. The acting is pretty decent, the stunts & fights well choreographed, not to mention exciting & MICHAEL JAI WHITE (SPAWN) makes for one of the best villains in this series as Seth, a virtually unstoppable & deadly fighting soldier, determined to get the code & kill Luc & anyone who stands in his way. VAN DAMME was a welcome return & his Luc Deveraux character here is much more animate & interesting, rather than the zombiefied Luc he played in the original. Here he is allowed to show tons of emotions & the story has more at stake here, with Luc's injured daughter being captured & the Unisols hunt for him, from which Luc must be forced to fight, if he ever wishes to escape. Former WWE\/WCW wrestler BILL GOLDBERG plays the rough & tough ROMEO, who hates Luc more than Seth does & even gets to use his trademark finishing manoeuvre The Spear on one victim he is fighting at a hospital. What's notable about this sequel is how the film ignores the two previous Canadian made, direct to DVD sequels that were released around the same time this one was hitting theatres & which caused much confusion for paying customers, since this film was posing as the second film to the 1992 original & BROTHERS IN ARMS & UNFINISHED BUSINESS were also claiming to be sequels to the first. Not surprisingly, considering the bigger budget, THE RETURN wound up being better than the first two sequels, in pretty much all area's of production, another thing that gives us a reason this sequel ignores the two sequels mentioned, is how in BROTHER'S IN ARMS & UNFINISHED BUSINESS, we are told the year is 1998 & the films pick up about a week after the events in the first. Where here the year is 1999. The only down side to the film is HEIDI SCHANZ's reporter character who is a paper thin Veronica Roberts (the news reporter heroine of the first film & the Canadian made sequels, mentioned to have died in this sequel) & is not given much to do throughout the films running time. In fact the only reason she is here is to serve as a new love interest for Luc (a plot line that is under developed & weak) & is nothing more, since her character serves the plot none at all. Former stunt man turned director MIC ROGERS but to good use his many years as a stunt performer & knows what action fans want & delivers a very polished & professionally done action epic. All in all, UNIVERSAL SOLDIER THE RETURN is a winner all around.

Deveraux confronts him, but things get even more out of hand, when Scott kills two hostages & both men wind up shooting each other dead. 25 years later, both men along with four other dead soldiers, are resurrected as part of a top secret U.S. military program called Unisols or Univeral Soldiers, who's emotions & memory are wiped clean & their skills monitored by scientists who control their every move. During a hostage take down from which said soldiers are used to kill the hostage takers, Deveraux has a flashback, but due to him being under the military's control has no idea what it is or why he experienced it. Later that night reporter Veronica Roberts (a great turn by actress ALLY WALKER) & her camera man sneak into the compound to see if they can get any information on how the military & police took care of the hostage crisis, since neither group wants to talk. Finding what appears to be a dead soldier, Veronica is shocked when the dead man, who's full of bullet wounds, arises & both her & her partner are captured when trying to escape by the Unisols. During the taking, Scott shoots the camera man dead, causing Deveraux to regain his memory & escape with Roberts. Both head cross country, with the Military in pursuit, along with the Unisols. When Scott regains his memory, during a confrontation with Veronica & Luc who escapes him, he slaughters those in control of the project & takes over himself, hunting Luc & Veronica determining to kill them & anyone who gets in his way, since he thinks the war is still on. UNIVERSAL SOLDIER is a highly entertaining action movie. A real fun popcorn film that never lets up from first frame till last. The direction by ROLAND EMMERICH was really cool. The acting was well handled, with Van Damme bringing a certain charm to his role as Luc. While Lundgren really relishes his role as the psycho soldier Andrew Scott, he's so much fun to watch & makes for a great imposing villain & plays the role with such a pure demonic fury, that it's hard to believe that anyone but him, could play this role. That said, despite the pairing of the two action stars, one would almost expect this film to be a super charged fight fest, with both men engaging in a series of fights both between themselves & others, but it never really occurs. In fact, the film's main action revolves around explosions, car chases & gun fights & very little on the hand to hand combat. The only fights here include Van Damme taking on some patrons at a bar\/restaurant that lacks any kind of excitement before finally meeting Lundgren in the climax for a final showdown. But the sad part is, it's a let down & has nowhere near the amount of excitement one would get in a fight between these two! it's clear that straight action is not director ROLAND EMMERICH'S strongest suit, since it lacks the high powered exhilarating moments one would have, could have & should have received here. The fight is not only shot from the wrong angles, but also after such an exciting build up that eventually leads to these two duking it out, it fails to deliver, despite the fact that the two men are phenomenal martial artists & could have coordinated a much better fight than this. All that aside, UNIVERSAL SOLDIER is still highly recommended. It definitely could have been better where the fights were concerned, but on a whole, It's a highly entertaining movie, that is definitely recommend to fans of both men.

There are some movies which do not get older but this is clearly out of date. However, I saw this film when I was a boy and for more than twenty years both the images as the story were unforgettable for me and most of my friends, until we could appreciate it again on DVD. Actually, I do remember this movie as the topic of several chats and meetings where old boys were talking about things we have in common. Therefore there was a little feeling of disappoint and even sadness when we finally had the DVD. Firstly, there was a theory about how naives our generation was. Secondly, I think there is something more. I would asset that this movie has something which should be interesting for all the modern film makers, specifically those who focus on the decaying horror genre. This is the mutilation, the idea which gives coherence to the film; the fact of a human being mutilated produces a deeper horror than death and torture. I remember how sick the sensation was, when the monster rip Kurt's arm out. And at the end; when the creature bites the doctor's neck to take a piece of his veins. Another remarkable thing is the morbid atmosphere which prevails without decaying in intensity through all the scenes, no matter if the action is on a secret lab, a lonely street where the man in a car is looking for a female body, a striper dressing room, and so on. May be the reasons why it is not longer a good movie are just technical things. For example, in the scene of the accident and the man saving his fiancée's head a more accurate work, made for another and modern second unit director could be interesting. Same thing with all action scenes, including the one of Kurt's arm. Furthermore, something could be done with the monster's make up. Some remakes have been good; I think in this case an attempt would worth while. Nevertheless, the black and white tones should be conserved.

After searching with no luck, her trail leads her to Paul Grogan, (Bradford Dillman) a recluse living up in the mountains. He tells her that the only way people would be up there is if they were swept away to a nearby damn. They pack up and head over to the damn, which also houses a secret military base. Breaking and entering, the two discover that the supposed closed facility is still operational. After getting away from a guard, they accidentally throw a switch, draining a pool in the middle of the facility into the river. Later, they discover that the pool housed a giant swarm of mutated piranha, which the military created for use in Vietnam and kept in the facility when the war ended. Now drained into the river system, Maggie and Paul work together with their creator, Dr. Robert Hoak (Kevin McCarthy) and local hotel owner Buck Gardner (Dick Miller) to keep the voracious predators from devouring everything in their path.The Good News I think this is Roger Corman's best movie he ever made. Sure, he's done others that are more famous, including his Poe films from the early 60s, but few can match the sheer fun that this movie is. This is pure campy fun, and the actors know that and don't try to get too serious. The situations that they get into even further the cheese along. Seriously, how can you take a film with mutant killer piranha without a grain of salt? It has to be like that, because then it wouldn't be so much fun. Off course, it wouldn't be that way without the generous gore. It was obvious that they wanted to up the stakes of gore that Jaws had, and this film blows it out of the water (no pun intended) in that respect. In here, we get slowly munched limbs, a lot of very gory bite marks on faces, skin seen visibly eaten away, and an infamous scene where a piranha takes flight and latches onto a person's eyeball. At the end, there are plenty of wounds seen inflicted on survivors as well, and with tons of blood spilt in between, this will not disappoint the gore hounds out there. That ending, wow, what can I say. It has it all plenty of action, tons of gore, deaths, survivors, and the bad guy gets what's coming to him. To have the kind of coordination and creativity to make that whole sequence a success is astonishing. It is the kind of scene that newer Hollywood action directors needed to watch because this scene gets it right. The action is shot in plain view for you to see what's going on, not that hyper-stylized jump cuts that so plague those films. You want to be able to see the action, not be confused by it, and that scene is a great example. It is a fast paced scene, but you know exactly what's going on all the time. That's the hallmark of a great director. He lets you see his set-pieces in great detail and care. This is also true of the special effects. I have to say it; the miniature piranhas are very well done. They look exactly like the pictures of piranha I've seen in pictures and on the National Geographic Channel. Back at that time, to actually make a believable animal in these kinds of films was so rare that it was embarrassing. Hardly any film from 74 to 80 had believable animals in these films, but this is one of the rare exceptions.

For the most part, Hepburn and her character in this movie have become one and the same; no discussion of the actress's life is complete without mentioning 'Breakfast' somewhere along the line.Hepburn was actually an eleventh-hour selection for the role of Holly Golightly. Truman Capote envisioned Marilyn Monroe as the lead female character and an offer was later made to Kim Novak. Hepburn was selected in the end, however, and George Axelrod's screenplay was massaged considerably to befit her elegance. Her performance has entered film history as a classic and will retain that status for years to come. Unfortunately, Hepburn's glamor came at a price; while suiting 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' to her disposition, much of Capote's novella was lost in the shuffle. 'Breakfast' is without doubt a very good film that belongs in the American canon. I do think, however, that it is slightly overrated, because the intense storyline of Capote's novella is thinned out for the sake of Audrey.The Capote version of Holly Golightly is a saucy, foul-mouthed drifter who is torn between her need for independence and her desire for an ideal, life-long partner. She is something of a forerunner to the 1960s 'liberated woman,' instead making use of loopholes in the 1940s social framework. We get a sense of Holly as go-getter in the film, but Axelrod and director Blake Edwards forward the action to 1950s New York City and portray her as more of a chic socialite than a vulnerable, Texas-bred outcast. Two of the underlying themes for Capote are our search for identity and the constant transformation that our selves undergo; these were only touched upon at moments in the Axelrod version of 'Breakfast.'Instead, the movie version seems to deal with a struggle between two wants emotional connection and material security. Both Holly and her on-again, off-again lover Paul Varjak (George Peppard) find themselves locked in situations where money is offered but love is not readily forthcoming. Paul is first in this jam, trading sex for money with Mrs. Failenson (Patricia Neal), a wealthy interior designer. Holly, herself a call girl, meets José, the rich Brazilian diplomat whose 'love' is not politically correct back home. Needless to say, the Hollywood formula in 1961 was for both characters to accept their true love, which is exactly how this film ends.Certain scenes in the film are clearly designed to show off the elegance of Hepburn, such as the apartment party, the visit to Tiffany and Company, and the five-and-ten shoplift, all of which are too long and detract from the main aspects of Holly's character. Axelrod and Edwards also give strange priority to Mr. Yunioshi, played by Mickey Rooney. The Japanese photographer annoyed by Holly is just a minor player in Capote's book, darting onto the stairwell and yelling in broken English every so often. In the movie, however, Yunioshi is used a great deal for comic relief, with Rooney giving an over-the-top effort. This stereotype is offensive nowadays, but racial slapstick was common at the time. It is one part of the film that has not held up well over the last four decades.Having said this, Hepburn and Peppard did know what they were about. Their romance is convincing and the two actors' chemistry is sensed from when they first meet on-screen. Patricia Neal and Martin Balsam (playing Hollywood mogul O.J. Berman) are excellent in their abbreviated roles and Buddy Ebsen (Doc Golightly, Holly's husband) gives a memorable performance 45 minutes in. José Luis de Villalonga (simply called 'Vilallonga' in the film credits) also does well in a modest English-speaking part as the Brazilian aristocrat.'Breakfast' was nominated for five Academy Awards, winning two in music. Henry Mancini won for best dramatic\/comedy score, while Johnny Mercer and Mancini won for best original song with 'Moon River.' Mancini does some nifty work here, transforming the 'Moon River' theme into each given situation and linking up the entire sound-picture. Blake Edwards should also be credited with his lovely visuals of New York City, including Central Park and, of all places, the New York Public Library's main branch on Fifth Avenue.I read Capote's novella about one year before watching its film version. While I have enjoyed both, the Hollywood treatment leaves something to be desired; the book offers much more.

It is a western-and probably the greatest western I've seen-that takes place during the Civil War (1862).In the beginning of the movie, Eastwood's unnamed character dubbed by Wallach's character Blondie (usually credited as Joe) meets and partner's up with the Mexican Tuco Ramirez (Wallach). Soon Blondie double crosses Tuco and Tuco swears revenge. While he is getting revenge by making Blondie walk through the desert with no water for miles, they stumble upon a dying man who in return for a promise of water tells them where $100,000 is buried. The only problem is that he tells Tuco what cemetery it's in, and tells Blondie the grave just before dying. They once again are partners and their future wealth depends on the other. Unfortunately, a notorious bounty hunter, who will do anything for money, Sentenza (Lee Van Cleef) nicknamed Angel Eyes knows of the money and tries to find it. Along the way the three run into the Civil War and our two heroes even get taken in as prisoners.The actors were well chosen. All three are\/were amazing actors able to portray the characters perfectly. It's not often that a Jewish actor from Brooklyn is as convincing of a Mexican as Wallach. He was able to give amazing life and character to the greedy, dirty, yet humorous, and somewhat lovable Tuco that I don't think the best actor of today could top. Eastwood played the type of tough, gun slinging, cowboy that he was so good at and I think he was born for. It seemed as if it were him just being his natural self the way he played Blondie, he was kind and showed compassion just with the expression on his face with the slightly squinting eyes and his constant offer of the only thing he could give to comfort someone, a cigar; and smart and reasonable, yet he was ready to kill anyone who started trouble or was in his way. Finally, Lee Van Cleef plays the bad-ass Angel Eyes, showing complete greed, and evil. His character is as cruel as can be and doesn't care who he kills or what happens to others just as long as he gets it his way, as he always does. Even the small characters played their part well from the drunk Union Captain to the old storekeeper whom gave me a few laughs to Father Ramirez (Tuco's brother) to even the poor fellow whom Angel Eyes kills in the beginning. And all actors gave a realistic look to it by the way they acted. They were not like some others in Westerns that had completely clean and well shaven faces. They had visible sweat and dirt on their faces, their hair was not always well combed (especially Tuco) and they were ragged when needed, they were more truthful, you can't go across the desert without getting dirty and sweaty. You could look at their faces and say wow, look at Tuco, he's dirty and unkempt and wow, Blondie's face is all messed up&#133; not the condition you expect the main character to be in or Not only does Angel Eyes have a dirty, cruel personality, but he looks so too. Another phenomenal thing about this movie was the soundtrack made by the ingenious Ennio Morricone. To call it amazing would be an understatement. The opening credits alone which is where that great music first graces the ears of the audience with its beauty are amazing. Even without seeing or hearing of the movie, you know the music, weather you've seen the movie or not. It has been in so many places, imitated so many times&#133; you could start playing it to someone who never saw a second of the movie and they'd whistle along to the familiar tune. In parts it is strong and in other parts it is soft as a kitten. In parts it bears the feeling of adventure and excitement, and in others through the air vibrates music more solemn and serious. In many parts, the movement of characters is done to the music. It is a famous and historic soundtrack and is most definitely the most famous of Morricone's work.Leone directed it fantastically too. Firstly, he uses the widescreen in a way unlike any other except Akira Kurisawa. Every inch of the screen is important to him, and he either fills it all with people and action, or makes it empty to create an emptier effect. He also does many great camera angles and shots. For example, a sequence of cannon fire looking straight at the mouth of the cannon or from the side or some slanted angle. He quickly cuts between the firing cannons to show pandemonium and to make it seem like heavier bombardment than it could if he simply showed the land being hit. He also deserves great credit (along with Luciano Vincenzoni) for writing such a great story and script. It is also worthy to mention how he went about the scene in which the characters blow up a bridge. He hired men to build a huge bridge and then rig it up with dynamite. Knowing that he only had one chance at this scene, he set up cameras all over the place to make a great moment in the movie and capture such a great image.I highly recommend seeing this movie and others with these actors and Leone. This movie alone has changed my life and influenced me with ideas. There is so much to enjoy, observe, and learn from this film. Anyone who sees this movie can see that the actors are amazing, that Leone is an auteur, and Morricone a musical genius. No one but these men could have created such a great classic western.

He established the career of Jamie Lee Curtis as a scream queen, and he knew how to shock movie goers and make them shiver with fear. His compositions of music (specifically the Halloween theme) is some of the most frightening pieces of music in film history. He acts, composes, produces, directs...and does it brilliantly. The Fog came shortly after the enormous success of Halloween. It reeks of the Carpenter\/Debra Hill style which is a very good thing as they were at the top of their horror game after Halloween. The Fog is very different from the previous horror film though. The Fog is very much a ghost story about vengeance as a crew of a wronged and robbed ship comes back 100 years later to exact revenge on the ancestors of the village people who wronged them.The film has to be looked at from two points of view, one of them being what it would have been like to sit in the theater thirty years ago and watch The Fog. It would have been brutally violent, shocking even, with it's rather bloodless but still violent death scenes. The intensely suspenseful atmosphere, and intense serious characters would have had everyone on the edge of their seat. Does some of this transfer over into the point of view of the movie goer now?? Absolutely!! The film is still suspense filled beginning to end. The mysterious Fog is thick and frightening and it's still edge of your seat. John Carpenter is also the master of cheap scares (the kind of sudden noises and events that make you jump) which The Fog is full of. When you're that much on the edge of your seat in the silent Fog you can't help but jump. The cast of The Fog is so well done and everyone does an amazing job. He put together a cast of some former Halloween cast mates and also some great character actors from the time. John Carpenter's wife at the time, and infamous Broadway actress Adrienne Barbeau does a great job as Stevie, the radio DJ who is first to lock on to the horrible secret of The Fog and tries to save her son and everyone else from her lighthouse post. Her intensity and seriousness is great and she doesn't have a lot of the setting to work with. Jamie Lee Curtis is still great as she continues to establish her status. This character is a complete 360 change from Laurie Strode in Halloween. She's much more forceful and independent. Unfortunately her character starts out this way but then kind of gets lost in everyone else and she's just kind of there. Tom Atkins plays lead actor Nick Castle. He's a pretty typical horror hero. Strong, good looking, very male...but his character is much more subtly used as well. All the characters possibly with the exception of Stevie (Adrienne Barbeau) aren't really the focus but instead are just all used equally. Perhaps that's why Adrienne Barbeau got lead credits.The Fog is suspenseful and scary and gory with it's kills. It was done with such a low budget, as was Halloween, but you'd never know it in a million years. If you really watch the film you'll see the corners they cut and the movie magic they used but otherwise you'd think it was a big budget product. The film does not have a lot of depth, that's my only complaint. Halloween opens up this deep and important story and history that was able to continue for many, many films but The Fog is pretty cut and dry so it relies on the cast, and the suspense to be interesting and obviously it accomplishes that. I am sitting in intense anticipation for the remake which I am a little afraid as to how much they will PG it down which seems to be the way nowadays but I still think it will be great and you must see this original horror classic before you see the remake.

Fine, I can live with that statement. But simultaneously, it's frequently named as one of the worst movies ever made, and I don't really agree on that level. Seriously, how bad can a movie be when there are so many talent and experienced cast & crew members involved? Because it's totally pointless and unnecessary, I hear you say? Sure thing, but about 85% off all movies are pointless, especially remakes of classic titles. Psycho indeed didn't require a modern update (heck, it still stands as the very first modern horror movie itself) but can you really blame Van Sant and his team that they saw a chance to make easy money? The new Psycho version is in color now, and the notorious shower-sequence is slightly more violent. These minor changes were enough to help younger audiences that, for whatever reasons never bothered to see the original, found their way to the theaters. You can debate endlessly whether Van Sant's style is blasphemy or not. Die-hard Hitchcock fans hate him because he so shamelessly copies every single aspect (the exact same music, cameos, facial expressions&#133;) but I'm sure they'd hate him even more if he added some personal elements, because then he would have violated a genuine classic. Even if you swear by Hitchcock, you can still enjoy the terrific acting performances here. Although a sublime actor, Vince Vaughn had the impossible task to play Norman Bates. There's no way in hell anyone can outshine Anthony Perkins, but Vaughn's performance is praiseworthy nevertheless. Some of the supportive roles are &#150; do I dare say it &#150; an improvement over the original. Viggo Mortensen, Julianne Moore and especially William H. Macy are a joy to observe. In the end, it doesn't really matter how unnecessary this remake is, since it hasn't (and will never) affect the position of Alfred Hitchcock's groundbreaking film.

I've watched this film countless times in the last few months since I bought the DVD - and every time my enjoyment and amazement of this film increases. The range of human emotion, of strengths and weaknesses, of the hopes, dreams, and failures we all experience in one way or another are all beautifully illustrated in a film that in its execution is nearly flawless. There are visual moments in this film that literally make my heart ache...and moments in the score that make my soul soar and others than cause it to weep. The cinematography is just fabulous - with every scene crafted perfectly - and fortunately without the overbearing slow-motion or heavy-handed digital manipulation which has ruined many films of late. The thing I like best about this film is that even though it is a war movie I never think of it as such....it is more a study of the transcendental nature of human thought, wonder, and emotion. Scenes like those where you see soldiers in the midst of carnage looking in amazement at some tiny jungle flower...or those where we see these men risking their lives to protect or ease the pain of wounded and dying comrades - these illustrate not just war but the human elements which both begin and end them. I strongly disagree with anyone who says that this movie shows U.S. soldiers in a negative light - war is war and that is just how it is soldiers on both sides are seen committing evil acts and that serves to define the underpinning point of this film - that war degrades us to our basest selves, in all things.

But I do believe that a screen adaptation should at least conform to the spirit of the original. This adaptation fails to do that, even though it follows the various events of the novel more closely than most other films bearing this title. The novel, as written by Bram Stoker, is the story of a few flawed but good humans versus a powerful creature symbolizing ultimate evil. Stoker's Dracula is pure selfish appetite coupled with a ruthless determination to satisfy that appetite, regardless of who gets hurt. That's what makes him totally evil, and totally fascinating. The character loses much of his symbolic power if he's portrayed as just an ordinary villain. To put it another way, we cannot imagine Stoker's Dracula refusing to bite the heroine when given the opportunity, while he whines, I love you too much, as the Dracula in this film does. Even though the Dracula films made with Bela Lugosi and Christopher Lee tend to stray far from the events of the novel, they are much more compliant with Stoker's brilliant vision of the Count.

Russell (recreating her Broadway triumph) portrays this woman, whose motto is Life is a banquet, and most poor suckers are starving to death. Living in a dizzying world of endless parties, free-thinking, gin-swilling and general extravagance, her life is irrevocably changed when she inherits her young nephew after the death of his father. Immediately, her dormant motherly instincts kick in, though she has no intention of raising him in the traditional manner. Instead, she intends to raise him with a varied and wide viewpoint, exposing him to all sorts of ideas and expression. This doesn't sit well with the nephew's trustee Clark, who demands a formal education. This conflict is merely the tip of the iceberg as Russell defies Clark, but winds up paying for it. Then the stock market crash of 1929 causes Russell to start from scratch. Fortunately, she lands a southern millionaire (Tucker), but while she's dallying with him, the nephew is influenced by Clark and his socialite friends. So it's up to Russell to clear out the snobby, bigoted set he's settled in with and guide him, not too gently, towards a different life. To say that Russell gives an exuberant performance would be the height of understatement. From the moment she zestfully lands on screen, she is in perpetual motion, continuously flitting around and yammering about anything and everything. It's a tour-de-force that shouldn't be missed. Some take exception to her nosy dominance or to the fact that her character revels in luxury that she hasn't created herself (and can't replace, herself, once it's gone), but the bigger picture is that she encourages people (all types of people) to get the very most out of life. She may be an acquired taste, but few actresses could have brought the same zeal, style and wide variety of vocalism to the part. (Witness Russell's wondrously on-target bits when she lowers her voice from it's airy, high-pitched fire alarm to a tough, gin-joint growl.) Apart from her many comic moments, she is also able to bring true feeling to the occasional poignant aspects of the story. She is aided, not only by a stunning array of elaborate costumes and set pieces, but also a stellar supporting cast, each of whom gets a chance to shine. Tucker is endearing as the love of her life. Haughty Browne is a delightful counterpoint to Russell and brings a lot of brittle, British, bitchiness to the table. As the nephew, both Handzlick (young) and Smith (older) offer up tender and thoughtful performances. Cass is a standout as Russell's frumpy secretary who is enticed by Russell to let her hair down, with shocking results. Waterman, Patrick and Barnes are also a highlight as the folks Russell will do anything to in order to keep them away from her nephew. Scott comes in late as a thoroughly appealing (and startlingly normal!) aide to Russell. Every role in the film is given admirable service by a terrific assortment of actors, but it's really Russell's show. She displays here the rare type of skill and finesse, mixed with heart, that's required in order to enact a role this gargantuan. Her shadow would loom large over Miss Lucille Ball, who had the unenviable task of attempting to fill Russell's shoes in the film of the musicalized version (Mame) sixteen years later. It's a task that, now close to fifty years after Russell's portrayal, no one else has taken on since (apart from Angela Lansbury on stage) despite continuous murmurings of a TV remake with everyone from Barbra Streisand to Cher.

What I mean by that is here is a movie about gay men that contains people I want to meet, that I would want to be friends with. Eli and Tom are two men that are thrown together due to the fact that their respective (straight) best friends would like to build on their meet cute. And how cute are these best friends? They are also portrayed as refreshingly normal, unlike other gay themed movies I have seen that shoehorn straight people into the movie in order to try to get mass appeal but only end up embarrassing those straight people who would want to see the movie. But I digress, The movie starts with the audience meeting two men. Eli, who is off to the AIDS test clinic, and Tom, who is off to an AA meeting. As each are at there respective appointments, the past is presented to show their relationship. The men don't get a meet cute, but their respective best friends do, in a furniture store where they bond over a buttercup love seat. The two then decide to use their respective gay best friends, supposedly to get them together, but actually to further their own budding romance. What an awkward first date the men have! Eli hopes his date doesn't smoke, so of course when we see them together that's what Tom does best. That and drink Absolute martinis. From there it is one awkward meeting for them after the other, both fighting an attraction they both will admit only to themselves. The families of each man are dysfunctional. I actually was far more embarrassed by Eli's, a couple of doctors who subject their small children to uncomfortable games about their feelings and only use dolls to get the kids comfortable with using correct medical terms for sexual organs. Christina Ricci gives a wonderful performance as Eli's seeming normal sister. Our meeting of Tom's parents is uncomfortable for completely different reasons, though probably much more common to many of us. The parents who suffocate themselves over what their dysfunctional lives have foisted on their children. At the wedding of the straight friends, the men finally realize what they mean to each other. I have probably left out a lot, but I think I am a little too emotionally attracted to this movie to be objective. By the time the men are dancing together and the closing song, I'm Gonna Make You Love Me by the Jayhawks started playing, I was actually cheering through my tears.

He only looks about 16 on the best of days Maguire, and even though he is supposed to be all sweet and innocent on his 'journey of discovery', Candy was just TOO mature for him. Let's just say any romance between the two was both unlikely and unrealistic.In spite of this, everybody involved manages to do a great job.

And there are films that you understand are important. From the third frame, you know; you know because the tracks to your limbs from the nerve-centre in your brain close down for engineering works, and your attention thereby freed repulses attacks from any other thought-source with vicious ruthlessness. You leave the cinema feeling cleanly dirty. And you can pronounce that how you want.This film is full of people doing noble things. There are some ignoble ones as well, but somehow they don't matter - and it illustrates so powerfully the inability of the liar to sustain his cause under the feeblest pressure that this is only surpassed by the way it handles truth as something to be expressed in between the script.Ah! the script!! In an earlier review of this film, one which bit the dust when my video recorder decided to remind me that I hadn't watched the second half again yet by taking itself off pause, I quoted a few lines. Now I don't want to quote lines any more context isn't so important, but implication that the script has peaks and troughs is a dangerous business what can you afford to ignore in this movie? That's if you can take your eyes off Mary Badham as Scout long enough to realise that there are other fine performances in this movie. But somehow, you come out knowing that Gregory Peck is a noble man who deserves the luck of having such a violent daughter with an insatiable appetite for outdoing her sibling. Who, in terms of the Deep South at least, is heroically noble to resist the sort of savagery that we are always left with the impression formed a staple part of the alleged-rape-victim's upbringing. I say alleged because I don't need to say any more. And if you still don't understand that, watch what Peck does after he has proved that Mr Ewell is left-handed. Or what Mr Cunningham does when he is confronted and exposed.I began by saying that there was a class of films that you just know are important. There are films you can find many reasons to watch. But the really great films don't let you find reasons not to make you watch them again. To improve yourself in life? Either make a stock exchange fortune, or imagine yourself getting the reception that Atticus gets when he leaves the courtroom after the verdict.I've gone ten because forty-seven would have been an excess. And spoiled the integrity of this website.I don't normally do positive discrimination, but I'm going to make an exception. Well, it's positive discrimination only in terms of feeling I had to mention something about Tom Robinson, or indeed, the reverend, or indeed any of the other coloured characters. Boo Radley isn't an especial hero in the film; nor Scout, nor indeed Atticus Finch. Poverty for them does not preclude happiness. They are merely doing jobs. Even when Atticus takes it in the face from the alcoholic, it is nothing compared to the suffering of a group of people who are systematically oppressed. The heroes of this film are people under pressure, using their situation to encourage others to create less pressure in the hope of awakening nobler deeds.
