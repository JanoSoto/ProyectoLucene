The other reason is the Untouchables but that's a whole different review. Not that everything he came out with after Bull Durham was crap but I think we can agree that the man has made some floaters since then.Anyway, to put it bluntly, I think that Bull Durham is probably the best baseball movie I have ever seen thus far. I say thus far because at the time of this writing, I haven't seen Field of Dreams (I know... shoot me. I promise I'll write a review for that one as soon as I see it.) which seems to be a popular choice as well, so until I see that one, this is it for me. Kevin Costner's Crash Davis is a great character, the kind of character that can make a star out of someone overnight if played correctly. Susan Sarandon as Annie was undeniably sexy and Tim Robbins as Nuke LaLoosh was enjoyably dim. The interaction of these three characters with one another provides for some hilarious one liners and moments that anyone can appreciate. This is a baseball movie that isn't only about baseball and I think that's what makes this film so good. Not only is it about baseball but it's also about love. It's about letting go and moving on to something new. It's about accepting your place in the world and making the most of it. The movie plays out very genuinely and while it's a comedy for the most part, it becomes something completely different near the end of the movie, when Crash is cut from the team after fulfilling his duty of mentoring Nuke. That moment of the movie is so heartbreaking that it really lifts the movie to a whole other level. That scene speaks volumes and yet, there's very little dialogue. Costner also delivers a monologue early on in the film regarding his character's beliefs that is probably one of the best monologues ever. The movie has a lot to say and is actually a lot deeper than it looks like on the surface. Every time I watch the movie again, I seem to pick up on something new I never noticed before and I love when a movie doesn't reveal everything so readily. There's a lot more I can say about this movie but I'll just end it by saying that it is very well-written and directed, the acting is great, it's both hilarious and touching at the same time and most importantly, you don't necessarily need to be a baseball nut to enjoy it.

After leaving this film last night at the theater, my wife and I had another two-hour discussion about this film. One of the discussions that we had was if the director's cut perhaps moved this perfect film from the world of fantasy into the world of science fiction. This is something to think about when you watch this edition. The ending of this film (not to give anything away) opens the door to the possibility of the genre change. Throughout the film there are hints towards this chance change, but it isn't until the end that it becomes clearer. That is what impresses me about Richard Kelley's unbelievable film, it opens your mind to several new ideas and possibilities. He does this by adding chapters from the book 'The Philosophy of Time Travel' to better guide us through the different phases that Darko encounters and experiences. Also, Kelley adds the images of the human eye to several of the scenes to create a stronger connection between the tangent universe and reality. This director's cut seemed more like a dream than the original, and I thoroughly welcomed this change.There are a handful of other scenes that Kelley adds that helps enhance the world around Donnie. We learn a bit more about his parents, his girlfriend, and his therapist. There also seems to be more referencing to religion in this edition. I was overjoyed to see this because I felt that was an aspect missing from the original. There is a wonderful discussing in this film between Donnie and his therapist concerning the difference between an atheist and an agnostic. This powerfully sealed the film for me. It allowed a bit more insight in Donnie's character as to where he stands on the issue of God and the strange events that are happening around him. It was as if the final piece of the puzzle was finally put into place. Thankfully with these extra scenes and better sound we can witness Donnie Darko in it's purest form. The way the director wanted it to be. We finally were able to see the finished product, and for some it may not be the finale they desired, but for this film fanatic it was extra icing on the cake. The additions of some new songs only help build the already haunting sound of this film. Honestly, who can match the remake of the Tears for Fears song 'Mad, Mad World'? It seemed like it was made explicitly for this film. Finally, how can you challenge a film that releases the secret to time travel? The truth is out there? Not unless you have seen this film. There are some cases when a director's cut will dramatically change the structure and sensation of the film. This was not the case here. Kelley changed nothing with his deeply developed characters or the overall story. The only aspect that I feel did change (and possibly not for everyone) was the possible genre switch. It will be up to you to see if this is true or not. Donnie Darko continues to remain on my top eleven films ever list. I do not see it dethroned anytime soon, especially with the release of this director's cut. It is a cultural phenomenon and a thought provoking film that will leave impressions on your mind for years to come. You will not see films like this in the recycled Hollywood riff that is currently being released, and I doubt we ever will, so go out and buy this film today. It honestly is one of the greatest ever to escape the grasp of Hollywood.You will never experience a film like this again in our lifetime.Grade ***** out of ***** ","genre":null},{"date":"7 November 2004","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" For those of you that have seen the original version of this film, the director's cut fills in some unanswered questions and nearly takes this film into a whole new genre.

Did The Devil asked for recognition and display of his power in order to give Raimi the winning formula?The Evil Dead is not an easy watch. The movie starts like a standard early 80's slasher flick but after half an hour of it's running time it turns into a bizarre gore-fest.Five friends (minimal stereotypes) rent a cheap cabin in the woods for some fun but suddenly, one by one they get possessed by an ancient evil spirit that rests in the woods. The plot sounds typical for the 80's horror but believe me, it's something you haven't seen! This movie is recognized internationally. I'm sure that the movie has been translated in many languages. Everyone knows about it. In my country, Mèxico, the title translation is The Devil's Awaken or something like that. This is now more than an obscure cult classic, it's THE EVIL DEAD.Adding the Necronomicon (Book of the Dead) into an early 80's slasher flick sounds a little pretentious but it isn't. It worked perfectly.The idea was totally asked for. The whole demon possession is believable because of the Necronomicon idea. In my opinion, since the brilliant Exorcist (the first big budget movie about demon possession), none other movie has had the adequate treatment of the topic like The Evil Dead. People that know a little of demon possession, evil incantations, treats with the devil (or selling your soul to him), and these kind of topics related to the occultism can tell that The Evil Dead is a movie that knows exactly what it's showing. The make-up (somehow related to The Exorcist) is excellent. Descriptions about possessed people actually match with the characterization used in the movie. The voices, the wicked laughs, the goofy evil spirits, the supernatural physical strenght, and the behavior that the movie shows is a display of what happens in real life cases. I wonder if Raimi was into Satanic stuff...Anyways, the weirdness of the situations combined with lots of gore makes this a unique cinematic experience. There are elements of horror from the 70's and the basic elements of the 80's all mixed up with Raimi's horror point of view. The black humor is present indirectly mainly because of the grotesque images that not everybody's imagination could craft. Still, there's nothing to laugh about if you're a die hard horror fan. If you want to laugh and watch an extremely gory film them watch the sequel to The Evil Dead. Bruce Campbell delivers a terrific performance under situations that you can't imagine. His face expressions, his yelling, and the torment expressed on his eyes, are the elements that make an unforgotten performance. The rest of the actors deliver a decent performance mainly because their acting skills were not needed at all.The scare factor is ALWAYS present through the movie and that's why it's difficult to label this as a straight horror movie or as a cheesy slasher flick. The tension is present in every scene and the usual but effective scenes that make you jump out of your seat work pretty good. The truth is that the movie works in EVERY field that the horror genre can offer. There's gore in huge amounts, there's tension, suspense, and the feeling of horror that not much films can offer. The Evil Dead contributed with several scenes to the genre and nowadays are labeled as infamous. For example, the pencil stabbed in the ankle, the demon in the cellar, the demons mocking, the possessed people, and the creepy but effective join us voices. The possessed Linda still gives me the creeps. Because of these elements and more , The Evil Dead is a cult classic and an important and basic movie in the genre. I wouldn't match this movie with The Exorcist but I would match it in a special category, the Evil Dead category. The trilogy (1, 2, and Army of Darkness) is a key franchise in the genre and will always be a reference for ANY horror producer. This franchise stands alone and deserves a lot of respect for it's contributions to the genre and to the industry! The Devil hasn't been very accepted in the genre but this time he looks cool. Anyone that has watched the movie MUST have an opinion about it; you either love it or hate it but if you're into the genre you will certainly have an objective review about it. I love this movie for what it is and I can say it changed my life and my point of view towards horror movies. You need to watch the movie at least 2 times to understand and live to it's full this gory experience. It's a horror movie you will never forget and believe me, it will stay with you for a long, long time. The demonic images, sounds, violent images, and of course, Bruce Campbell will hunt you until you become a die hard fan of the movie. This is a fantastic horror movie with fantasy elements, disturbing elements, and the occasional correct use of gore. What else can you ask for?!Watch it for a good scare and you will get MORE than you expect. Probably the best horror from the 80's, no kidding. Also, it's probably in the top 10 of the best horror movies of all time.10\/10. It's contribution to the genre raises it's perfect grade. A MUST HAVE FOR ANY HORROR FAN!!!

The movie starts like a standard early 80's slasher flick but after half an hour of it's running time it turns into a bizarre gore-fest.Five friends (minimal stereotypes) rent a cheap cabin in the woods for some fun but suddenly, one by one they get possessed by an ancient evil spirit that rests in the woods. The plot sounds typical for the 80's horror but believe me, it's something you haven't seen! This movie is recognized internationally. I'm sure that the movie has been translated in many languages. Everyone knows about it. In my country, Mèxico, the title translation is The Devil's Awaken or something like that. This is now more than an obscure cult classic, it's THE EVIL DEAD.Adding the Necronomicon (Book of the Dead) into an early 80's slasher flick sounds a little pretentious but it isn't. It worked perfectly.The idea was totally asked for. The whole demon possession is believable because of the Necronomicon idea. In my opinion, since the brilliant Exorcist (the first big budget movie about demon possession), none other movie has had the adequate treatment of the topic like The Evil Dead. People that know a little of demon possession, evil incantations, treats with the devil (or selling your soul to him), and these kind of topics related to the occultism can tell that The Evil Dead is a movie that knows exactly what it's showing. The make-up (somehow related to The Exorcist) is excellent. Descriptions about possessed people actually match with the characterization used in the movie. The voices, the wicked laughs, the goofy evil spirits, the supernatural physical strenght, and the behavior that the movie shows is a display of what happens in real life cases. I wonder if Raimi was into Satanic stuff...Anyways, the weirdness of the situations combined with lots of gore makes this a unique cinematic experience. There are elements of horror from the 70's and the basic elements of the 80's all mixed up with Raimi's horror point of view. The black humor is present indirectly mainly because of the grotesque images that not everybody's imagination could craft. Still, there's nothing to laugh about if you're a die hard horror fan. If you want to laugh and watch an extremely gory film them watch the sequel to The Evil Dead. Bruce Campbell delivers a terrific performance under situations that you can't imagine. His face expressions, his yelling, and the torment expressed on his eyes, are the elements that make an unforgotten performance. The rest of the actors deliver a decent performance mainly because their acting skills were not needed at all.The scare factor is ALWAYS present through the movie and that's why it's difficult to label this as a straight horror movie or as a cheesy slasher flick. The tension is present in every scene and the usual but effective scenes that make you jump out of your seat work pretty good. The truth is that the movie works in EVERY field that the horror genre can offer. There's gore in huge amounts, there's tension, suspense, and the feeling of horror that not much films can offer. The Evil Dead contributed with several scenes to the genre and nowadays are labeled as infamous. For example, the pencil stabbed in the ankle, the demon in the cellar, the demons mocking, the possessed people, and the creepy but effective join us voices. The possessed Linda still gives me the creeps. Because of these elements and more , The Evil Dead is a cult classic and an important and basic movie in the genre. I wouldn't match this movie with The Exorcist but I would match it in a special category, the Evil Dead category. The trilogy (1, 2, and Army of Darkness) is a key franchise in the genre and will always be a reference for ANY horror producer. This franchise stands alone and deserves a lot of respect for it's contributions to the genre and to the industry! The Devil hasn't been very accepted in the genre but this time he looks cool. Anyone that has watched the movie MUST have an opinion about it; you either love it or hate it but if you're into the genre you will certainly have an objective review about it. I love this movie for what it is and I can say it changed my life and my point of view towards horror movies. You need to watch the movie at least 2 times to understand and live to it's full this gory experience. It's a horror movie you will never forget and believe me, it will stay with you for a long, long time. The demonic images, sounds, violent images, and of course, Bruce Campbell will hunt you until you become a die hard fan of the movie. This is a fantastic horror movie with fantasy elements, disturbing elements, and the occasional correct use of gore. What else can you ask for?!Watch it for a good scare and you will get MORE than you expect. Probably the best horror from the 80's, no kidding. Also, it's probably in the top 10 of the best horror movies of all time.10\/10. It's contribution to the genre raises it's perfect grade. A MUST HAVE FOR ANY HORROR FAN!!!

The reason he has it, is because of the way his typical action movie formula appeals to just about every man who likes to watch action movies; big guns, one-liners and plenty of action. The reason most Schwarzenegger films have an audience is because we all know that Arnold rarely deviates from this formula, so we can always expect him to kick ass, dispense one-liners and carry guns that are so big that one who doesn't know much about him might think he is overcompensating. In this, he doesn't deviate much from the formula, but I found it somewhat interesting that he did actually get hurt in this one. Normally we never see him get hit, kind of like James Bond(only more raw and less of a sex-addict), but in this, he was injured at least twice. He also has fewer one-liners than usual, and some of the action is less raw and violent than usual, for a Schwarzenegger film. The plot is pretty good, and less far-fetched than many of his other films. The pace is decent, but the film could(and should) have been shorter, because by the time the showdown comes around, you've grown tired of the film and merely want it to end soon. The action is pretty good. The (apparently) famous short sequence in which Arnold brandishes two huge EMP rifles isn't terribly overrated(it definitely looks cool) but it's not all it's cracked up to be. The acting is decent, a few of the actors are (read Caan is) great. The characters are somewhat well-written and credible. All in all, a pretty typical, decent Arnold flick, only really for fans of him. I recommend it to fans of Arnold Schwarzenegger, and not really anyone else. 6\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"7 November 2004","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Arnold Schwarzenegger has a wide fan base.

I don't know too much about his directorial style, but if any of his other films are like this one, I'll have to watch more of them. The visual style is amazing. The whole film has sort of a psychedelic visual style, and utilizes constant cuts and constant change in color scheme, often changing between powerful green, blue, red and even black\/white. Of course, none of this is random. It's there to project symbolism and keep the mood intense and constantly evolving, and, believe me, it works perfectly. With many references to popular media(television, mainly), demons and the desensitizing effect of television. The effect of half of the imagery being seen through a television screen or hallucinated is amazing. The film is experimental and psychological. As Stone puts it in the documentary, it's a film about two people breaking the rules, so it's only fitting that the film-makers are also breaking the rules. It's chaotic and wild, insane and mentally exhausting. It's a film about pain, violence and giving in to cravings and desires. But it in no way romanticizes the aforementioned three points. Quite the opposite. I believe someone once told me that the film makes killing and violence look appealing. I can't even explain how wrong that is. This truly is an amazing film. If you can sit through this, and you (honestly) think of yourself as perceptive and intelligent, you have to see this movie. It's not just recommended or a good idea to watch, it's mandatory for anyone that 'get' it. The plot is great and well-paced. It's never boring. The acting is great. The characters are well-written, credible and so easy to understand and sympathize with that many will hate the film for it. The whole film is amazing on so many levels. I recommend it to any person who believes himself or herself to be hardened and intelligent enough to sit through it, and, more importantly, understand it.

With most films, I am able to predict exactly what will happen and when. With Powder I could never quite tell what was going to happen next, and the ending was something I would have never imagined would happen and could only be described as extraordinary. There are so many elements to this movie The paranormal; the challenge to everything we think we know about science and the capabilities of the human mind; the human capacity for cruelty; love and forgiveness; and the hope that our own humanity will one day advance beyond our own technology. Most of all, the raw emotion of this great masterpiece reaches deep into the heart and leaves an impression that stays with you. This is one of those rare movies that you will never forget, a true classic that illustrates truths about humanity that have existed since the beginning of time.

The most I'd seen of Christian Slater was in 'Robin Hood', and didn't care much for him in that.What a change one movie can make for opinions on an actor.I was engaged with this movie from frame one.Cliff Eidelman's score is captivating and very moving in this movie, flowing along effortlessly with the film. Marisa Tomei is pure magic, and Rosie Perez is just right as the screechy best friend.What surprised me most was Slater's performance. Here, he gives a very introspective and introverted performance, that, in my opinion, was worthy of an Oscar nod. The mannerisms with which he portrays Adam as the shy orphan who seems unsure of himself are dealt with great detail and care. He hasn't had a better performance before or since.That doesn't overshadow Tomei's performance in this film. She is simply beautiful, no matter what part she is portraying. She has the Minnesotan accent down pat, and you believe you are in the Twin Cities while watching the film. I feel her performance in this movie was a step above My Cousin Vinny. Too bad the Academy didn't agree.And when Slater and Tomei occupy the frame together, it is, for a lack of a better term, absolute glory. The chemistry between these two actors on screen is so thick you couldn't cut it with a chainsaw.The cinematography, by Jost Vacano, who also did movies like Das Boot and Robocop, while not visually stunning, is very technical, with the use of pull-pans\/push-pans and ground perspective shots. A very well-done film all the way around, from Bill's directing to Mia Goldman's seamless editing.

The proclamations of affection between these two are so charming, yet not heavy handed.

But you really should experience it without any preconceptions. Suffice it to say that I highly recommend the film. If you've enjoyed Lynch's work before, you'll probably love Mulholland Dr.; if you're not familiar with his movies but like an unconventional film experience that challenges your intelligence, you'll probably love it; but if you prefer conventional stories that don't require you to engage your cerebrum beyond paying attention, you'll probably hate it. Anyway, if it sounds like you'd like it, go out and see it and don't read any further. Okay. The first clue that you are NOT in for a conventional film experience is when the words A Film By David Lynch appear on the screen in the film's opening seconds. Unlike the much more widely-lauded Tarantino, with who he shares a penchant for non-linear narratives, Lynch is not content to merely let his film be a mere bloody and foul-mouthed homage to a number of B-movie genres. No, Lynch is, as he always does, going to challenge his audience--delighting many and royally ticking off others. Lynch spends nearly two hours gradually building up a complex narrative--a mystery with some typically Lynchian quirks--and the characters in it, all the while suffusing the events on the screen with an ominous sense of foreboding and dread. Then he takes an unexpected left turn, deconstructing everything that went before. The result is breathtaking, and unlike most modern films that you can dissect in mere minutes, this one could keep you arguing for weeks. Lynch is willing to take chances that make most other film-makers wet their shorts. He allows the camera to linger longer on a particular shot than most of today's ADD-ridden, MTV-trained directors are willing to do. He's unafraid to use unusual camera angles, or to try to find the disturbing qualities in mundane, ordinary inanimate objects. Brian De Palma spent most of the 80s trying to be Hitchcock's successor and failed; Lynch is the Master's true heir. He gets great performances from his cast, too. Harring and Theroux are both strong, but Naomi Watts is the real stand-out, showing incredible depth and range. No wonder this role put her on the map, and deservedly so.There's a lot of discussion about making sense of the film's abrupt narrative change, but I got it within minutes, on the first viewing. All the clues were there. I'm more interested in what the film's about.Most of Lynch's work (especially his two other best-known works, Twin Peaks and Blue Velvet) portrays the dichotomy of America cheery, neighborly, painfully naive optimism on the one hand; and a dark, seedy and dangerous underbelly on the other. With that perspective, it's amazing that it took him so long to make a movie about Hollywood. The first part of the film is not just a dream, it's an illusion, and that's what Hollywood is all about. And we don't just love and cherish those illusions, we need them desperately. When Betty\/Diane's illusions are stripped from her, when she sees the hypocrisy of Hollywood, it doesn't bring enlightenment. She and the one person she loves most are both destroyed in the process. As a result, we end up seeing the first two hours of the movie as Diane's desperate, final attempt to reboot her life. She attempts to live it out as it should have been, as it could have been. But reality intrudes. She's had the blindfold pulled from her eyes, and she's not just seen her worst, ugliest side, she's set it loose upon her ex-lover and eventually herself.This is dark, even horrific stuff, and tragic as well. It's also damn brilliant.

No wonder this role put her on the map, and deservedly so.There's a lot of discussion about making sense of the film's abrupt narrative change, but I got it within minutes, on the first viewing. All the clues were there. I'm more interested in what the film's about.Most of Lynch's work (especially his two other best-known works, Twin Peaks and Blue Velvet) portrays the dichotomy of America cheery, neighborly, painfully naive optimism on the one hand; and a dark, seedy and dangerous underbelly on the other. With that perspective, it's amazing that it took him so long to make a movie about Hollywood. The first part of the film is not just a dream, it's an illusion, and that's what Hollywood is all about. And we don't just love and cherish those illusions, we need them desperately. When Betty\/Diane's illusions are stripped from her, when she sees the hypocrisy of Hollywood, it doesn't bring enlightenment. She and the one person she loves most are both destroyed in the process. As a result, we end up seeing the first two hours of the movie as Diane's desperate, final attempt to reboot her life. She attempts to live it out as it should have been, as it could have been. But reality intrudes. She's had the blindfold pulled from her eyes, and she's not just seen her worst, ugliest side, she's set it loose upon her ex-lover and eventually herself.This is dark, even horrific stuff, and tragic as well. It's also damn brilliant.

I recognized the name from the title, but I was pretty sure that it wasn't all going to be about Andy Warhol. I was perplexed and ready for yet another adventure down the path of our nation's undiscovered history. When I first started watching this movie I knew nothing about Valerie Solanas. She is not in the history books labeled next to Andy Warhol, or is she one that oozes sympathy. Solanas is a trash talking, independent thinker that somehow found herself next to one of the most modern men of our century, Andy Warhol.Lili Taylor helms this unbridled beast Solanas like no actress I have seen before. I honestly felt as if Taylor had transformed herself into this brutal feminist. After the first ten minutes, I didn't even recognize Taylor because she had successfully transformed herself into this insane (?) character who carried this film on her shoulders. Taylor plays this woman who, for reasons unknown, constantly seeks Warhol's attention and approval. When Andy refuses to devote his entire attention to her, her mental stability begins to fail. In hopes to bring her back into the spotlight, and hopefully demonstrate to the world her manifesto, she does what the title of this film suggests. Sadly, this has the opposite effect and she is forced to live with the act that she committed instead of the words that she has written.Taylor was phenomenal in this role. She stole the scene from everyone and was never afraid to take Solanas to the next level. Thankfully, she has some help from some amazing back-up stars to only help boost her performance. Jared Harris is superb as Andy (one of the best reincarnations of him) and Stephen Dorff blazes onto the scene as Candy Darling. Oscars should have been handed out for their parts in this film, but unfortunately this was yet another film the Academy ignored.Outside of the acting, director Mary Harron does a fabulous job of setting the scene and building the image of this era. Warhol was a genius, and because of his fame and notoriety he somehow attracted some of the most interesting people in the world. This is one of those stories of a woman that wanted to attach herself to this great man, yet somehow couldn't. Harron directs these actors to show this with perfection. Her brash cinematography and direction seem to blend perfectly in this boiling pot of history. Her mix of documentary and biography genres works well in this film. She commands attention behind the camera, and her actors react with positive responses. This was a gritty story not for everyone's tastes. It was a very true story that is more than just Andy Warhol, but also develops themes of feminism and women's rights. Was Solanas crazy? I don't think so, I just think she was ahead of her time and not afraid to be herself.Grade ***** out of ***** ","genre":null},{"date":"7 November 2004","score":"3 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":" When I first found this film I wasn't sure whom it was about.

There's no doubt that Altman wanted to do an antihero film, but after all MASH is a portrait of doctors who make jokes and tries to survive with humor. Themes like stupidity and horror of war are not treated, there isn't an analysis of this. Where's the antimilitarist message?Even if it's an Altman movie, the film looks like a long TV movie. The director made much better movies. The only interest here, to me, is seeing young actors like Donald Sutherland, Elliot Gould, Tom Skerritt, Robert Duvall, René Auberjonois and Sally Kellerman.
