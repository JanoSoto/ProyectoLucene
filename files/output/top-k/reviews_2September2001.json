Even then, he is still quite funny at many points.  I was surprised by some of the darker elements of this movie, most notably Mortimer Brewster's(Grant) brother Jonathan.  The movie(or play for that matter)takes a rather dark twist upon the arrival of his character.  I was not expecting it to be dark at all.  The running Boris Karloff joke was quite amusing though.The best thing of all though are Moritimer's aunts.  They are easily to most memorable and enjoyable characters in the movie.  Seemingly so innocent, and really they have no bad intentions at all.  They are happy Mortimer fell in love, scared of Jonathan and so forth.  They are the best thing in the movie, and unfortunately aren't in it quite enough.  The other characters really aren't anything special.  The bumbling police force, Mortimer's crazy brother that thinks he is Teddy Roosevelt and Jonathans friend, Dr.Einstein, are all underused a bit and at times irritating.  Most underused however is Priscilla Lane, who plays Mortimer's new wife.  She is hardly anywhere to be found, and its a shame because I would have liked to have seen more of her as well.Even with all the extra stock characters, and a mad cap ending that seems to last a bit to long, this movie is still worth watching.  At least you should watch it to see the two innocent old women.  They are great characters.  I know I'll never look at little old women the same way again.  7 out of 10.

This is a fine film and a fine remake.  It is almost an exact duplicate of the original as far as the basic story goes, even using most of the names ver batim.  What it does have that the earlier version does not is more exposition.  In this one we get more in-depth characterization.  This is clearly evident in the scenes between Beatty(who by the way does a fantastic job in probably his best role ever) who is in the body of a wealthy industrialist and his servants.  The character has cocoa with his servants, treats them like men rather than servants, and this really underlies the whole heart of the script in this film.  This film has great acting, just like its forebear.  Beatty is very good, but acting honors really go out to James Mason as Mr. Jordan, Buck Henry as the blundering heavenly escort, Dyan Cannon as a murderous wife, Jack Warden as Max Corkle, and Charles Grodin in a very funny role as a personal secretary cheating on Beatty's rich body.  The chemistry between Grodin and Cannon is very apparent.  Buck Henry gives another low-key comedic gem of a performance.  And what about Jack Warden?  Will this guy ever get the credit he is due as an actor?  For me though, James Mason steals the film as the heavenly Mr. Jordan, even outshining Claude Rains from the original.  Mason is a class act all the way!  This is a fun film with lots of heart and an underlying message about what being human is all about...or rather should be all about.  I know many want to say its better or worse than the original.  I like them both.  If I had to pick...I would pick this over the original only because it is a funnier film and it has some great music.  The score is done by Dave Grusin and it is original, creative, and memorable.

Now, I prefer the movie, if only because I like movies more anyhow. I thought the slight changes in story and mood worked well, and that Rebecca got exactly the screen time she deserved. Zwigoff and Clowes did a super job in translating the theme and characters to the big screen, and made great choices in tailoring the story-line and the visuals to produce a screenplay, set designs, costumes, etc. Getting Sophie Crumb to do Enid's sketchbook was a stroke of genius, those drawings deserve a best supporting nomination, or something. For me, the sketchbook underscored that Enid is more creative than negative; she just has a hard time getting a handle on how to be so, and nothing is happening to help her out on this journey. Rebecca and all the minor characters - from dad to art teacher - also helped tremendously in explicating this point, and made a great supporting cast. Thora Birch and Steve Buscemi were both perfect. I was really happy to see Buscemi looking pretty attractive and playing such a sympathetic and thoroughly-drawn character.I think this movie does an excellent job of telling the truth about Enid and what goes on inside her and around her. The screen Enid is remarkably realistic in terms of portraying what girls like her experience and create in their own lives. Enid really comes close to being archetypal for a certain sort of young woman, who wants much, much more than what life is currently offering, and blunders around  - hurting and helping herself and others, by turns - in sometimes desperate attempts to find what she wants, to capture or to create what she imagines to be possible. She reminded me so much of myself and my friends, it was scary and wonderful to see.I will not soon forget how I felt when I caught this movie the first time, and plan to see it again, before it disappears from the screens.

Zwigoff and Clowes did a super job in translating the theme and characters to the big screen, and made great choices in tailoring the story-line and the visuals to produce a screenplay, set designs, costumes, etc. Getting Sophie Crumb to do Enid's sketchbook was a stroke of genius, those drawings deserve a best supporting nomination, or something. For me, the sketchbook underscored that Enid is more creative than negative; she just has a hard time getting a handle on how to be so, and nothing is happening to help her out on this journey. Rebecca and all the minor characters - from dad to art teacher - also helped tremendously in explicating this point, and made a great supporting cast. Thora Birch and Steve Buscemi were both perfect. I was really happy to see Buscemi looking pretty attractive and playing such a sympathetic and thoroughly-drawn character.I think this movie does an excellent job of telling the truth about Enid and what goes on inside her and around her. The screen Enid is remarkably realistic in terms of portraying what girls like her experience and create in their own lives. Enid really comes close to being archetypal for a certain sort of young woman, who wants much, much more than what life is currently offering, and blunders around  - hurting and helping herself and others, by turns - in sometimes desperate attempts to find what she wants, to capture or to create what she imagines to be possible. She reminded me so much of myself and my friends, it was scary and wonderful to see.I will not soon forget how I felt when I caught this movie the first time, and plan to see it again, before it disappears from the screens. I think Dan Clowes is brilliant for letting Enid jump on the big screen and helping her do it so well.

The rape scene, as you've probably heard, is one of the most disturbing scenes I've ever seen.  Another scene that I found pretty gross was when Brian Cox felt up Cunningham's lover and held his visibly slimy fingers under Cunningham's sleeping nose.  I really didn't need to see that.Nevertheless, the movie is pretty brilliant.  The love between Mary and Rob is very believable and very touching.  The scene where the young man who was supposed to keep watch over the Roy family is crying and yelling after the retreating enemies is particularly poignant (especially when he realizes just how severe their attack was).  His reaction to Mary's pain tears your heart out.  As is the case throughout the film, you really don't feel like you're watching actors.  This is all very real.  And Tim Roth?  Unbelievably convincing in his role as the degenerate but ruthless antagonist.  His effeminate simpering and whimpering are nothing less than chilling.

Less breathtaking but equally memorable is the end of the final duel where Rob grabs Cunningham's sword in his bare hand to win.It's hard to imagine Rob Roy any differently than it is.  As I think, I wish this was toned down or that was different I am reminded of the scene in Amadeus where Tom Hulce asks how you expurgate a perfect work.

At first, it's funny, but then, as Smith returns to the bit over and over, he seems to reveal himself as a tad obsessive. It's as if he has a problem with anyone using this new medium of free expression to do anything but praise his movies. So, Kevin, I hope you're reading this...Ever since his first ultra low-budget breakthrough, Clerks, I've recognized a great filmmaker inside Kevin Smith, a great filmmaker who's constantly being stifled by his own immature tendency toward self-indulgence. It's a fault that is best personified in each of his films by the recurring characters of Jay and Silent Bob, played by Jason Mewes and -- speaking of self-indulgence -- Smith himself.These two stoners, never have much to offer and each of their appearances have generally detracted from Smith's efforts. In Dogma, for example, the pair's vaguely Wayne-and-Garthish act largely took away from what was otherwise a clever, interesting take on a serious subject. When that movie came out, I complained the duo were a habit Smith needed to grow out of. Instead of growing beyond the characters, he's now gone and devoted an entire film to them.The movie is Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, and Smith claims it's the last of his Askewniverse movies -- the Askewniverse being the ever-growing cadre of New Jersey-based characters around whom all of his films have revolved. But in fact, let's hope it's the last we see of Smith's aforementioned self-absorbtion. If it is the end, then it's only because he's overdosed this time.The tagline on the poster may suggest this is a comedy about Hollywood, but it's really a movie about Smith himself. The plot sends our weed enthusiasts west to Tinsletown in order to sabotage production of a movie based on a comic book that's based on them (for which they're not getting paid). But it's really just an excuse to make references to movies Smith has made, movies that Smith's friends have made, or, on a couple of rare ocassions, movies that Smith simply likes. And I say references, because that's all he really does -- reference his past films. He doesn't joke about the films or do anything clever. He expects us to be thrilled by the mere mention of past projects. It's like he keeps winking and nudging us in the ribs as he plunges deeper and deeper into the center of his own personal galaxy.Simply being self-referential isn't interesting anymore. Been there, done that. Seeing Ben Affleck's character acknowledge the existence of an actor named Ben Affleck as he stares knowingly into the camera just isn't enough of a punchline.As the movie goes on, Smith continues to make increasingly obscure references to his own movies. These jokes may reward his large cult of fans, but those fans would probably be better rewarded if he gave them a decent film instead.There are some funny madcap bits as Jay and Bob traverse the nation, and Smith for once actually shows some visual flair, but it's usually not long until the next lame film reference. One of the few times he manages to do something clever with these allusions is when Affleck and Matt Damon pop-up in an funny riff on Good Will Hunting. But too often, Smith is merely reveling in the work of others without contributing anything worthy of his own. I'm sure it's always been Kevin Smith's dream to get in a light saber duel with Mark Hamill, but that does not mean anyone but Kevin Smith will be entertained by it. If someone ever gives me a budget to make a movie, I won't use it to subject other people to my own personal fantasies.When we're not being subjected to tepid film parodies, we have to listen to Jay's incessantly annoying catch phrases. As a film tandem, Jay and Silent Bob have never really worked, mainly because Bob is, well, silent. Smith actually does a lot with pantomime and facial expressions, but it's hard to contribute to the comedy when you can't say anything. There's also very little original about them. Cheech and Chong did the drug thing better, Beavis and Butthead did the dumb thing better, and Penn and Teller did the silent-partner thing better. Worse, they're just not likable. Jay isn't just a doofus -- he's a creep. Smith asks us to believe that a hottie like Shannon Elizabeth would fall for Jay because she can see that deep down, he's innocent and well-meaning. But Smith offers no evidence to support her contention.Much of Jay and Bob's banter, as it were, consists of fart jokes and gay jokes. When I heard that GLAAD was protesting the film, I figured they were overreacting. But, having seen the movie, I can see why they're upset. It's not that any of the gay jokes are particularly heinous, it's just the sheer quantity of gay jokes that's disturbing (count on one at least every five minutes).Aside from all the homophobia and self-glorification, Smith does contribute one original element to his Askewniverse in the form of Will Ferrell, who does his usual blithering idiot routine as a Federal Wildlife Marshall. Ferrell provides the same schtick you see every week on SNL, but the sad thing is, he's the funniest thing in the whole movie.I guess the joke is on me for bashing Jay and Bob in the past, then paying to see a movie about them. But maybe I'm just optimistic. I keep hoping Kevin Smith will fulfill his potential and make a great movie. This isn't it.

Jay isn't just a doofus -- he's a creep. Smith asks us to believe that a hottie like Shannon Elizabeth would fall for Jay because she can see that deep down, he's innocent and well-meaning. But Smith offers no evidence to support her contention.Much of Jay and Bob's banter, as it were, consists of fart jokes and gay jokes. When I heard that GLAAD was protesting the film, I figured they were overreacting. But, having seen the movie, I can see why they're upset. It's not that any of the gay jokes are particularly heinous, it's just the sheer quantity of gay jokes that's disturbing (count on one at least every five minutes).Aside from all the homophobia and self-glorification, Smith does contribute one original element to his Askewniverse in the form of Will Ferrell, who does his usual blithering idiot routine as a Federal Wildlife Marshall. Ferrell provides the same schtick you see every week on SNL, but the sad thing is, he's the funniest thing in the whole movie.I guess the joke is on me for bashing Jay and Bob in the past, then paying to see a movie about them. But maybe I'm just optimistic. I keep hoping Kevin Smith will fulfill his potential and make a great movie. This isn't it.

Not a question everybody is going to have to ask themselves, to be sure, but what if that guy moved in next door to you?  It's a situation that just may induce an introspective moment or two.  Which is exactly what happens in `The Whole Nine Yards,' directed by Jonathan Lynn and starring Bruce Willis and Matthew Perry.  Hit-man Jimmy `The Tulip' Tudeski (Willis) ratted out his boss in Chicago, and now he's on the lam.  He makes his way to Canada, where he buys a house next door to a hapless dentist, Nicholas `Oz' Oseransky (Perry), who is suffering from inherited debts and a shrew of a wife, Sophie (Rosanna Arquette), not to mention a mother-in-law from Hell (Carmen Ferland).  When he realizes who his neighbor is about to be, his first instinct is to run, but Sophie has other ideas.  It seems there's a price on Jimmy's head; one Janni Gogolack (Kevin Pollak) would like to take his revenge on the guy who's responsible for his father going away for a long, long time.  So Sophie squeezes Oz into a corner until he agrees to go to Chicago and meet with Janni to put the finger on Jimmy.  Not a great idea, Oz thinks, but it at least sounds like a nice vacation, so he goes.  But, of course, he should have stayed with his instincts, because he soon finds himself looking down the barrel of trouble.  And the only way out, it seems, is down...\tWhat Lynn put together here is actually a fairly light-hearted, black comedy; the nature of the story dictates that there will be violence in it, and there is, but much of it is implied rather than graphic.  The pace is good, and Lynn develops the characters enough to let you know exactly who they are and what they are all about.  There's not a lot of depth, but it's not necessary; the actors have each made their respective characters unique to a point that puts them beyond stereotype, and it works perfectly for this film and the story.  Some of what happens is inevitable, though not necessarily predictable, and certain aspects will keep you guessing right up to the end.  Typical of a comedy that leans to the dark side, nothing in this story is cut and dried.\tWillis is perfect as Jimmy The Tulip, giving a rather reserved, subtle performance that puts Jimmy's guarded but confident manner into perspective.  Underneath it all, this guy is really rather cold-blooded (he has to be, given his choice of employment), but his relationship with Oz gives it some warmth, at least externally.  Like Chow Yun-Fat in `The Killer,' Jimmy is likable, but when you consider at arm's length who he is  and what he is capable of, it's a bit disconcerting.  And that's one of the aspects of the film that is so interesting-- because you know who and what Jimmy is, you never really know which way things are going to turn. \tPerry is excellent, as well, as `Oz.'  Henpecked and in dire straits, he is something of an updated version of the W.C. Fields character in `It's A Gift' or `The Bank Dick,' although a bit darker.  Perry is charismatic, has impeccable timing with his delivery and uses physical comedy to great effect.  His reactions to Willis and the situations in which he finds himself are brilliant and hilarious, and he seems to instinctively know just how far to take it to make it work.  And it's the little, seemingly insignificant things he brings to the character that give the film that extra something and creates some memorable moments.\tThe supporting cast includes Michael Clarke Duncan (Frankie Figs), Natasha Henstridge (Cynthia), Amanda Peet (Jill St. Claire), Harland Williams (Special Agent Hanson) and Serge Christianssens (Mr. Boulez).  It may not be the most original movie ever made, but `The Whole Nine Yards' is funny, has a great cast of actors who have taken characters you've basically seen before and made them their own, and does exactly what a film like this is supposed to do  Entertain.  It's not going to make you ponder the universe or the state of the world today, but it's going to give you a couple of hours of laughs and some residual chuckles.  Which, when you think about it, is not such a bad deal.  It's the magic of the movies.

Which is exactly what happens in `The Whole Nine Yards,' directed by Jonathan Lynn and starring Bruce Willis and Matthew Perry.  Hit-man Jimmy `The Tulip' Tudeski (Willis) ratted out his boss in Chicago, and now he's on the lam.  He makes his way to Canada, where he buys a house next door to a hapless dentist, Nicholas `Oz' Oseransky (Perry), who is suffering from inherited debts and a shrew of a wife, Sophie (Rosanna Arquette), not to mention a mother-in-law from Hell (Carmen Ferland).  When he realizes who his neighbor is about to be, his first instinct is to run, but Sophie has other ideas.  It seems there's a price on Jimmy's head; one Janni Gogolack (Kevin Pollak) would like to take his revenge on the guy who's responsible for his father going away for a long, long time.  So Sophie squeezes Oz into a corner until he agrees to go to Chicago and meet with Janni to put the finger on Jimmy.  Not a great idea, Oz thinks, but it at least sounds like a nice vacation, so he goes.  But, of course, he should have stayed with his instincts, because he soon finds himself looking down the barrel of trouble.  And the only way out, it seems, is down...\tWhat Lynn put together here is actually a fairly light-hearted, black comedy; the nature of the story dictates that there will be violence in it, and there is, but much of it is implied rather than graphic.  The pace is good, and Lynn develops the characters enough to let you know exactly who they are and what they are all about.  There's not a lot of depth, but it's not necessary; the actors have each made their respective characters unique to a point that puts them beyond stereotype, and it works perfectly for this film and the story.  Some of what happens is inevitable, though not necessarily predictable, and certain aspects will keep you guessing right up to the end.  Typical of a comedy that leans to the dark side, nothing in this story is cut and dried.\tWillis is perfect as Jimmy The Tulip, giving a rather reserved, subtle performance that puts Jimmy's guarded but confident manner into perspective.  Underneath it all, this guy is really rather cold-blooded (he has to be, given his choice of employment), but his relationship with Oz gives it some warmth, at least externally.  Like Chow Yun-Fat in `The Killer,' Jimmy is likable, but when you consider at arm's length who he is  and what he is capable of, it's a bit disconcerting.  And that's one of the aspects of the film that is so interesting-- because you know who and what Jimmy is, you never really know which way things are going to turn. \tPerry is excellent, as well, as `Oz.'  Henpecked and in dire straits, he is something of an updated version of the W.C. Fields character in `It's A Gift' or `The Bank Dick,' although a bit darker.  Perry is charismatic, has impeccable timing with his delivery and uses physical comedy to great effect.  His reactions to Willis and the situations in which he finds himself are brilliant and hilarious, and he seems to instinctively know just how far to take it to make it work.  And it's the little, seemingly insignificant things he brings to the character that give the film that extra something and creates some memorable moments.\tThe supporting cast includes Michael Clarke Duncan (Frankie Figs), Natasha Henstridge (Cynthia), Amanda Peet (Jill St. Claire), Harland Williams (Special Agent Hanson) and Serge Christianssens (Mr. Boulez).  It may not be the most original movie ever made, but `The Whole Nine Yards' is funny, has a great cast of actors who have taken characters you've basically seen before and made them their own, and does exactly what a film like this is supposed to do  Entertain.  It's not going to make you ponder the universe or the state of the world today, but it's going to give you a couple of hours of laughs and some residual chuckles.  Which, when you think about it, is not such a bad deal.  It's the magic of the movies.
