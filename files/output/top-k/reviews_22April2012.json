[{"date":"22 April 2012","score":"2 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" George Lucas let FX take over instead of a story. The first three also had chemistry among it's lead characters making you like them. Other than Ewan McGregor (Obi-wan) and Darth Maul who actually had fun, it was a disaster. Sorry, I didn't buy Liam Neeson as a Jedi. A total bad kids flick. The little kid did as good as can be expected. The direction was horrible in his case (and others). You can really tell who could and can't act in this flick. Yeah, you George Lucas. Instead of Star Wars the Space Opera, Lucas treated us to explaining the force. Won't say how, but was it really necessary? No. It was better as a mystical thing. The Pod racing idea was utterly ridiculous. Maybe because of all the CGI characters or whatever they were. Here's an idea where was the suspense like Luke attacking the first Death Star? Shouldn't there have been any suspense other than wondering what in the heck Queen Amidala's next hairdo would be? The attack was bound to succeed. Could've been a nail biter though. Why did she have so many and everyone else have just like one? Queens are elected? C'mon! The first 3 films deserved great ratings. This one didn't even deserve to be associated with them, didn't even deserve to be made.
