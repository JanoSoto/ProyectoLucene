Moore was just a clown, looking for his next joke. When Moore wanted to quit after 1979's Moonraker, they should have let him go.But Timothy Dalton brought a serious side to the role. You can see that he's determined to get the job done, and realizes he could be dead any minute, so he focuses on the mission and not clowning. Just like Sean Connery did back in the 60's.---> As for the actual story, that too is serious & well-written. And it's more-or-less a sequel to On Her Majesty's Secret Service. In that earlier movie, Bond's wife is killed by an evil agent, and in this movie you can see that Bond is still upset about the death... as though it just happened a few months ago. (Someone hands him a bride's garter, which symbolizes coming marriage, but Bond rejects it. He's still hurting from his loss.)As though depression about his dead wife wasn't enough, his best friend Felix Liter has been viciously attacked, laying in a hospital's critical care ward, and Felix's just-married wife has been murdered. (Notice how it's a near-identical to what happened to Bond in OHMSS.) These three deaths\/near-deaths drive Bond over the edge, he resigns as a secret agent, and proceeds to seek revenge against the man who killed Felix's wife.And thus begins a long adventure to discover the mystery man behind the killings. And like I said earlier, Dalton does an *excellent* job in this role. I highly recommend his movies. 10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"31 August 2005","score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Watching the Living Daylights & now License to Kill, I can see that Dalton was *far* superior to Roger Moore.

Very soon, a childhood torment becomes a reality as brother Johnny repeats to his sister - They're coming to get you Barbra... The first undead creature they encounter results in tragedy, as Johnny stumbles and cracks his head on a stone. Barbra (correct spelling as listed in the credits) for her part breaks the first rule of zombie escape as she heads for a confined space, a lonely country home in the middle of nowhere.We learn that others have beaten her there, having retreated to safety in the wake of mass revivals of dead corpses, the story gradually revealed via a series of radio and television broadcasts. Apparently, radiation on an earthbound satellite that was part of a Venus probe has triggered some kind of awakening in the brains of the recently deceased. The victims have become a virtual army of unidentified assassins, having a penchant for the flesh of living human beings.It would be easy to dismiss NOTLD as a trash zombie flick, but if you follow it closely, an intelligent exposition of the story transcends the film's limited budget and it's skimpy production values. In fact it's the dark and grainy aspect of the movie that gives it a character and a step up on the typical B grade horror flicks of the preceding era. The classic scene of the nighttime advancing corpses is one that will stay with you long after the movie is over.The movie maintains it's story line consistency as well; when the Cooper's young daughter succumbs to her illness and dies, she comes alive hungry for human flesh and without regard for her closest target, dear old mom. In turn, Helen Cooper comes back none the worse for wear after young Gina hands her a thrashing in spades. As the zombie horde finally breaks into the farm house, protagonist hero Ben barricades himself in the cellar against his own earlier advice, killing the Cooper's a second time, as advised by news reporters covering the countrywide phenomenon - Kill the brain and you kill the ghoul.It's the little things that writer\/director George Romero pays attention to as well that make this a horror classic. Remember brother Johnny - well he shows up later in a quick cameo as a member of the zombie horde, returning for his sister.I recall how Night of the Living Dead created a stir upon it's original release in 1968. Now almost forty years later, movie making technology has advanced to the point of leaving virtually nothing to the imagination. But your first glimpse of the bloody skeletal head at the top of the stairs in NOTLD is the kind of image that nightmares are made of, after your imagination takes over.

I first saw this at the age of 14 and it made quite an impression on me even then.I like the lack of a pretty unbelievable love story. You have for romance the Strauses, the young honeymoon couple, and even a bit of Lightoller smooching Mrs. L. You really do not need more than that in a credible TITANIC film. The costumes were pretty good and true to the time Her Ladyship (whom I believe, based on her lines in the lifeboat, was meant to portray Lady Lucile Duff-Gordon)is great as the snobbish aristocrat...oddly enough her husband seems to care more about people getting picked up--at least he doesn't dismiss it the way his wife does. And her evening gown in the scene where she and her husband are seen entering the First Class Dining Saloon...looks like something out of Worth or Poiret (as an aside here on costuming, in the 1953 version of TITANIC, Barbars Stanwyck's gown seems much truer to the fashion of the time, as does the day dress in the scene where she is reading a poem to Robert Wagner.The black-and-white format gives the film a definite period feel that works nicely with the script and actor performances. Colour probably would have ruined it. And yes, I have cried watching this film as after 47 years, this film still has not lost its ability to move people.
