Actually it's the second time I had tried to watch it, but the first time I actually finished it. And I have no desire to ever see it again.I do have to say that 2001 has amazing visuals. The space scenes of all sorts are simply stunning and hold up quite well even today. There was obviously a lot of effort put into them. Definitely the highlight of the movie.The effects are also amazingly realistic. The scene where Dave has to blow the hatch on his pod and momentarily be exposed to space is realistic in a way I've never seen in any other movie. First off, there is no sound of an explosion or anything else, which makes perfect sense since there is no sound in a vacuum. He also doesn't explode or be severely injured, unlike every other movie set in space.2001 is a ponderously slow film. But that's not my main problem with it, though. I can watch slow films so long as I have a reason to keep watching; as in an investment in the characters. There is a severe lack of character development and none of the characters, even the infamous HAL, are shown long enough or in a way that allows me to have any sort of attachment to them. The only character that got any development at all was mankind itself in the first part of the movie, and I can hardly sympathize with a primitive, brutal character as portrayed there. The individuals later in the movie were shown as being largely expendable, with no real reason to be anything but indifferent about their fate. HAL itself was the only character I had any shred of sympathy for, ironically showing himself to be more human than the crew members aboard the ship. Yet I was still largely indifferent when he was disconnected. Yes, indifference is a word that describes my attitude towards pretty much all the characters in this movie.Because of my indifference to the characters I had no reason to really ponder what the story was beyond what was shown on screen. I did not care what the purpose of the monoliths were since they affected characters I did have any investment in.As a visual feast this movie fares quite well. As a means for telling a story, it falls flat. A story needs characters and that's what 2001 sorely lacks.

(She eventually died in 2008). Claus was accused of attempting to murder his wife by injecting her with insulin. The prosecution alleged that his motives were financial; his wife, an heiress in her own right, was considerably wealthier than him, and it was alleged that after her death he hoped to use her fortune to marry his mistress. At his first trial Claus was convicted and sentenced to thirty years imprisonment. This verdict was quashed on appeal, and he was subsequently acquitted in a second trial. There have been a number of good films, such as In the Name of the Father and Let Him Have It which have told the true stories of real-life miscarriages of justice, but Reversal of Fortune is not really a film of this type. As Claus von Bülow was eventually acquitted, the film-makers could not, without inviting a writ for libel, imply that he was guilty of the attempted murder, but for some reason they seemed equally unwilling to state definitively that he was innocent. (Possibly because they were unwilling to offend that large section of American public opinion which had taken a dislike to a supercilious European aristocrat and had judged him guilty). Consequently, we do not see very much of his life with Sunny (and what we do see is shown in flashback), and we see nothing of the first trial in which he was convicted. Jeremy Irons was awarded the Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of von Bülow, although I have never understood why. It is not in my view Irons' best performance; he has given better ones in The French Lieutenant's Woman and The Mission, which came before Reversal of Fortune, and in the likes of Waterland, The House of the Spirits, and even Damage, which came after it. None of these films even brought him a nomination. Nor in my view was this the best acting performance in 1990; that to my mind was Kevin Costner in Dances with Wolves, although Gerard Depardieu might also have had a claim for Cyrano. The Academy, however, doubtless felt that Costner would have to be content with Best Picture and Best Director and that to give him a third award might make him big-headed. As for Depardieu, the Academy has always had a bias in favour of American movies and against foreign ones, especially foreign-language ones. (In 1990 no actor had ever won Best Actor for a foreign-language performance). Irons' performance here is not a bad one, but it is to my way of thinking too one-dimensional to be worthy of an Oscar. He plays von Bülow as a cold, self-absorbed individual, speaking throughout in the sort of aristocratic British accent that today even most British aristocrats would find a bit too fruity for their tastes. (Although von Bülow was Danish by birth, he was educated in England). He never displays any real emotion; neither the tragic fate of a woman he once loved, nor the prospect of having to spend thirty years in jail, can rouse him to any display of feelings. Although the film never directly states that von Bülow was guilty as charged, we never feel for him the sort of sympathy we would normally feel for a man wrongly accused, and on an emotional level it would be all too easy to visualise Irons' character as a man quite capable of trying to murder his wife for her money. Indeed, in many ways the film is more about von Bülow's lawyer Alan Dershowitz than it is about von Bülow. (This is not surprising, given that it was based upon Dershowitz's book about the case). Dershowitz is portrayed as a left-liberal radical lawyer, who takes the case less because he is convinced of his client's innocence but because he believes that important principles of law, particularly those relating to the admissibility of evidence, are at stake. The film concentrates upon the appeal proceedings in which Dershowitz persuaded the Rhode Island court of appeals to overturn the original conviction, but appeal hearings, which largely deal with technical points of law, do not generally make for great excitement, and the chance to make the film a courtroom drama was passed up. Unfortunately, the film does not find any alternative sources of excitement. The story is too slow-moving for my liking and the overall emotional temperature is far too cool. Whereas in films like In the Name of the Father and Let Him Have It I could empathise with the plights of Gerry Conlan and Derek Bentley, in Reversal of Fortune I ended up not caring whether von Bülow was acquitted or not. 5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"25 February 2010","score":"7 out of 14 people found the following review useful","review":" On 21st December 1980 Martha (Sunny) von Bülow, the wife of the aristocratic Danish socialite Claus von Bülow, collapsed at the family's mansion in Newport, Rhode Island, and fell into a coma from which she never recovered.
