It makes you feel terribly small, and also, in a strange way, quite big. &#x96; David LeanSome brief points...1. Of all of David Lean's films, Lawrence of Arabia is perhaps his most beautiful. Here's a director who waited months for the perfect sunset, who spent hours composing every shot. 2. Virtually every other sequence in Lawrence of Arabia is logistical nightmare, Lean having to frame grand compositions, choreograph huge crowds, build vast sets and manage hordes of animals.3. Lean's Attack on Aqaba sequence is staggering. Lean built an entire town, with over 300 buildings, all for a single unbroken shot which tracks an army as it swarms a coastal city. When Lean's camera finally draws to a halt, revealing the Mediterranean Sea and Aqaba's massive coastal cannons, we can't help but gasp.4. A super influential film. You look at Lawrence today and you see bits of Star Wars, Close Encounters, 2001 A Space Odyssey, Indiana Jones, Kingdom of Heaven etc, all over the place. The film contributed hugely to our cinematic vocabulary.5. Unusual for a film this size, there was no second unit photography. Lean shot everything himself, too much of a perfectionist to abdicate duty.6. Though it attempts to convey the intricacies of imperialistic politics and touches upon racial difference and homosexuality, the film's sense of geography and politics are a bit muddled, and its portrayal of Thomas Lawrence hardly factual. Indeed, because of people like Lawrence, and various other events, both before and after the infamous Sykes-Picot agreement, the Middle East was carved up and artificially divided for the very purpose of destabilisation and proxy rule. The problems of this period extend to our era.7. In his biography, Lean states I think the whole of this creativity is sex. There's no two ways about it. And if you want to go and make a good movie, the fact of it is that sex is terribly important. If you want to make a good movie, get yourself a new, wonderful woman and that movie will be fifty, if not seventy, percent better than it would have been if she hadn't existed. It lights everything up. You see, I think lack of energy and tiredness is sexual failure.8. In a way, the film's also about Lean himself, and the way the alienation of Lawrence's homosexuality mirrors that of the artist. Lean was born to strict Quaker parents who banned him from going to the cinema. In response, he developed a fondness for the desert and a passion for exotic locales (on screen and off). Lawrence of Arabia itself almost plays as a kind of autobiography, a story about a man\/director who travels to the desert, falls in love with its people, gains wealthy financing, has a grand vision and realises his dreams by managing, inspiring and directing thousands of men. In a way, the film is less about Lawrence the man than it is about creativity as a kind of libidinal drive; a sort of big budget take on Freudian sublimation, creative energy stemming directly from the libido.9. Watching the film again, its amazing how preoccupied it is with personal identity and sexuality. The film opens with a scene which demonstrates that nobody really knew who Lawrence was and that any effort to sketch him on screen is an exercise in futility. Later in the film a man ominously shouts Who Are You? when he sees Lawrence, and all throughout the film Lawrence is seen to be extremely conflicted, unsure how to act, how to dress, unsure of his very place in the world. Is he Arabic? Is he British? Is he masculine? Is he feminine? Which culture does he most identify with? Why has he turned his back on his country?10. Of course Peter O'Toole portrays Lawrence as a very effeminate man. He's homosexual, sexually repressed and sexually conflicted. This is a guy who's psyche is so damaged by being rejected and alienated that his ego compensates by writing its own history, by creating an image of himself as an epic hero, the perfect man who conquers nations and rallies thousands behind him. Watch how he admits to being sexually aroused by guns and sadomasochism, but reacts violently when a foreign General makes homosexual advances toward him. It's almost as though Lawrence's entire hero persona simply extends from this timid guy's desire to assert his own sexuality.11. The film is suffused with sexual innuendos and homosexual jabs, ranging from subtle lines (That's not the kind of man I am!) to more blatant signals (Lawrence dancing alone, obsessed with shaving etc).12. Interesting too is the way Lean and screenwriter Robert Bolt turn Lawrence's masochism into a kind of psycho-sexual anti-war statement. After taking part in a massacre, Lawrence slowly turns his back on his masters. War is the villain of the piece, screenwriter Robert Bolt would say years later, for it takes this fine and hardy man and turns his own best qualities against him, filling him with revulsion for himself. 13. The film is often praised for its visuals, but few mention how innovative Lean's sound design is. Lean uses the wind as music, makes excellent use of ambient or incidental noises and uses bubbles of silence to create some extraordinary moments of tension. He creates a wonderful aural tapestry.8.5\/10 &#x96; This may be the gayest epic of all time.

I wound up getting a bit comprehensive, so I figured I would post it here, as well. For the record, I really like this movie, but I must be 'in the mood' for it. One of Brandos best performances, equally good are Malden, Johnson and Pellicer. Even the lesser roles and semi cameos (ex., Timothy Carey), are good, and the cinematography....just WOW. Here's where my 'message board blog' begins.....Wow. I've had a good print of this for 2-3 years, and just decided today to watch it 'big screen'. For no reason whatsoever, I decided to attempt to understand what Brando was looking to make, as opposed to what Paramount finished, or Kubrick was involved with. For the record, Kubrick leaving makes this the 'missed opportunity' of All-Time Hollywood, IMO. As others have stated, clearly there are entire chunks of storyline missing. I believe Marlon went in there and tried to fully develop 6-7 characters in this film. (example...the Tim Carey character. He's well known to Dad, and at the 'Chili Scene' he has a nice big shiner...from where?) It seems to me a few of the characters (as edited) enter the film already developed. His Mexican partner, Dad's wife, even Lon. Luisa seems to 'grow' emotionally in between the scenes we see her. I believe Brando's cut of this would have been four hours long. This was because he was developing a common theme for them all. The film is called One Eyed Jacks....plural! What Marlon was 'directing', through all of the scenes, day in, day out, was the idea every character had two faces to show. Take the business of Rio sleeping with Luisa. Luisa (pure) lies to Dad and her mother (also played fairly pure). Dad asks Mom to find out the truth, and tell him. The girl lies to Mom, Mom KNOWS IT, and in turn lies to her husband. Everyone, even the good guys, are full of....you know what. In fact, the film, as cut, purest characters are the gang. Amory, the other guy, and Rio's jail pal. But, as the film is edited, you know there was a ton of back story with Rio's jail pal, as well. I mean, yeah, I grasp that they escaped from jail together, but through their interaction, it is clear there were more scenes between them on the floor. Flawed? How about this train of thought. Kubrick was planning his 'duality of man' theme we saw developed later in Full Metal Jacket. Marlon stepped in and tried to 'flesh out fully' every major character. This would have somewhat contradicted Kubricks style of coldness towards 'dramatic stereotypes'. Also, bare in mind, it has been said that Brando intended the ending to be completely ambiguous. Then, when Marlon couldn't stand the pressure of editing, Paramount had to 'create' a cohesive story out of all this. I think Marlons 4 hour 'drama' would have been a fascinating bit of film history for film geeks, but would have been DOA at the box office. Paramount probably tried to put the ambitious vision together, but couldn't come up with a cohesive version that moved. So what they wound up doing was this They decided to attempt two dramatic character arcs. The Brando\/Malden characters are given coinciding arcs, and all the other film\/characters become plot aids. The Pina Pellicer character becomes the device that 'changes' Rio, even though her character was probably much fuller on script. And because she is the pivotal change device, she garners more film time then feels right....because there always seems to be something missing, owing to interactions involving the other characters, all of which we don't see, as they've been edited out. Paramounts other choice would have been to edit together a simple revenge movie. This may have even played better at the box office. I'm glad they went the way they did. For instance......here's an edit I can imagine being done. The film opens much the same as it does, up until Rio gets captured. Now spend about another 10 minutes in the jail, where Rio is brooding with his com padre, steaming inside. They plan their escape. He meets Amory, goes up to Monterey. You can do the whole 'Dinner at Dads, Town Party' segue way without affecting the film. Rio seduces Luisa, the following morning, he tells her he's shamed her...and FADE THERE. She has no response. She is now just a plot tool to show Rio getting even with Dad. Now splice in either the bank robbery or the killing of Tim Carey....any reason to put Rio in jail. Get the gun on the table....get a distraction to get Lon out of the room, you can do the whole 'tension scene' involving Rio getting the gun. He gets out, Dad and Rio shoot it out. I'm sure versions were shot with both dying. Or it wouldn't surprise me. No love interest, not much focus on Amory, no whipping, broken hands, recovery. Or maybe get the whippings in there, somehow. But my point is, it seems to me Paramount made an attempt to give us something other than a simple revenge\/shoot 'em up, which they could have. OK, my very flawed writing style gives all sorts of 'flaws' in this film. BTW, I love this movie....I really do, one of my favs. Peace ","genre":null},{"date":"19 November 2009","score":"","review":" I wrote this up in the context of a message board topic.

I believe Marlon went in there and tried to fully develop 6-7 characters in this film. (example...the Tim Carey character. He's well known to Dad, and at the 'Chili Scene' he has a nice big shiner...from where?) It seems to me a few of the characters (as edited) enter the film already developed. His Mexican partner, Dad's wife, even Lon. Luisa seems to 'grow' emotionally in between the scenes we see her. I believe Brando's cut of this would have been four hours long. This was because he was developing a common theme for them all. The film is called One Eyed Jacks....plural! What Marlon was 'directing', through all of the scenes, day in, day out, was the idea every character had two faces to show. Take the business of Rio sleeping with Luisa. Luisa (pure) lies to Dad and her mother (also played fairly pure). Dad asks Mom to find out the truth, and tell him. The girl lies to Mom, Mom KNOWS IT, and in turn lies to her husband. Everyone, even the good guys, are full of....you know what. In fact, the film, as cut, purest characters are the gang. Amory, the other guy, and Rio's jail pal. But, as the film is edited, you know there was a ton of back story with Rio's jail pal, as well. I mean, yeah, I grasp that they escaped from jail together, but through their interaction, it is clear there were more scenes between them on the floor. Flawed? How about this train of thought. Kubrick was planning his 'duality of man' theme we saw developed later in Full Metal Jacket. Marlon stepped in and tried to 'flesh out fully' every major character. This would have somewhat contradicted Kubricks style of coldness towards 'dramatic stereotypes'. Also, bare in mind, it has been said that Brando intended the ending to be completely ambiguous. Then, when Marlon couldn't stand the pressure of editing, Paramount had to 'create' a cohesive story out of all this. I think Marlons 4 hour 'drama' would have been a fascinating bit of film history for film geeks, but would have been DOA at the box office. Paramount probably tried to put the ambitious vision together, but couldn't come up with a cohesive version that moved. So what they wound up doing was this They decided to attempt two dramatic character arcs. The Brando\/Malden characters are given coinciding arcs, and all the other film\/characters become plot aids. The Pina Pellicer character becomes the device that 'changes' Rio, even though her character was probably much fuller on script. And because she is the pivotal change device, she garners more film time then feels right....because there always seems to be something missing, owing to interactions involving the other characters, all of which we don't see, as they've been edited out. Paramounts other choice would have been to edit together a simple revenge movie. This may have even played better at the box office. I'm glad they went the way they did. For instance......here's an edit I can imagine being done. The film opens much the same as it does, up until Rio gets captured. Now spend about another 10 minutes in the jail, where Rio is brooding with his com padre, steaming inside. They plan their escape. He meets Amory, goes up to Monterey. You can do the whole 'Dinner at Dads, Town Party' segue way without affecting the film. Rio seduces Luisa, the following morning, he tells her he's shamed her...and FADE THERE. She has no response. She is now just a plot tool to show Rio getting even with Dad. Now splice in either the bank robbery or the killing of Tim Carey....any reason to put Rio in jail. Get the gun on the table....get a distraction to get Lon out of the room, you can do the whole 'tension scene' involving Rio getting the gun. He gets out, Dad and Rio shoot it out. I'm sure versions were shot with both dying. Or it wouldn't surprise me. No love interest, not much focus on Amory, no whipping, broken hands, recovery. Or maybe get the whippings in there, somehow. But my point is, it seems to me Paramount made an attempt to give us something other than a simple revenge\/shoot 'em up, which they could have. OK, my very flawed writing style gives all sorts of 'flaws' in this film.

In fact, it's about the trashiest film I have seen in ages--and I've seen a lot of films!! The characters in the film are 100% awful and low-class--sort of like a 1930s version of the guests from The Jerry Springer Show! The film is unapologetically trashy--with boobs (and a whole lot more), cursing, irreverence and rednecks galore! It's obvious that Roger Corman was NOT trying to make a film that would be featured on Masterpiece Theatre or in the Criterion Collection! The film is about 'Mama' (Angie Dickenson) and her two rotten daughters. After starting a fight during a wedding and running off, this lovely brood goes into business selling moonshine and doing anything else they can to earn a buck...and I mean anything. And yet, despite being trashy and wicked to the bone, Mama declares that they are a nice family and refers to her white-trash daughters as my little girls--even when they strip in public or sleep around with practically anyone or anything. We are obviously NOT talking about a deep or particularly consistent group of people! Later, this wholesome family kinda drifts into the bank robbing business. In a genuinely funny scene (one of the few in the film), during their first robbery, another gang also tries to rob the bank at the same time! In the process, one of the gang members are killed and the two gangs merge--with Tom Skerritt now becoming the love interest for Mama. Just a bit later, Mama meets up with William Shatner--and almost immediately jumps into the sack with him. Skerritt isn't pleased and assuages his feelings by jumping in the sack with BOTH of the younguns'. Despite also living during the 1930s, this WON'T be mistaken for The Waltons!In addition to this sick group are two Federal agents--one of which is a perennial actor in Corman films, Dick Miller (Bucket of Blood and Little Shop of Horrors). Both these agents have the intelligence of maggots and I assume they were added for comic relief--just like Boss Hog and the boys from The Dukes of Hazard.This is also obviously NOT a film to show your pastor or rabbi!!! I can also see CC's point--this film is bound to offend ANYONE--particularly religious people. This film is obviously what you might call a guilty pleasure--you just turn off your brain (and your sense of moral outrage) and enjoy as best you can. It is especially recommended for people who consider The Dukes of Hazard and Jackass and Flesh Gordon to be fine family entertainment.So, despite being 100% trashy, is the film worth seeing? I would say for most people, no--mostly because the writing and acting are incredibly broad (i.e, BAD). This simply is a poor and rather vulgar film--though possibly enjoyable in a low-brow sort of way. While some might like such an unapologetically bad film, others might just have their jaws drop in disbelief at the utter awfulness of it all. Of course, stupid people may enjoy this mess of a film. You KNOW this is so when William Shatner's performance is the most subtle and understated in the entire film!! A couple final notes, and not that it matters as this is NOT a film for purists, but one scene has a picture of J. Edgar Hoover on the wall--circa 1960. A mistake but hardly important considering everything. Also, over a decade later, Big Bad Mama II debuted.

A mistake but hardly important considering everything. Also, over a decade later, Big Bad Mama II debuted. Considering how the first movie ended, I have no idea how such a sequel could have been possible.

It is easily one of the best survival films that I have ever seen.The film is about billionaire Charles (Anthony Hopkins) who goes on trip to Alaska for a photo shoot with his wife (Elle Mcpherson). After traveling with photographer Bob (Alec Baldwin) to a remote cabin 80 miles North of where they were staying they have their plane crash and are forced to find a way back to where they came from and forced to survive in the wild.The story is great and easy to follow. A great survival story set in the Alaskan Wilderness. The scenery and images in this film as well as the camera work is outstanding.Acting is incredible. Hopkins is outstanding as the lead character Charles. Hopkins shows great range as the older and wise man who is able to adapt all of his knowledge in a survival situation. Also Alec Baldwin is good as well in this film as the sort of not as knowledgeable guy who is waiting to backstab. Elle Mcpherson is great also, maybe more so as something to look at than as an actress, but still.However the best actor in this film is not a human actor in my opinion. Bart the Bear is great in this film as the ravenous bear that is constantly coming after the group lost in the woods. When I first saw this film Bart scared me so much and is truly the most talented animal actor that I have ever seen. May he rest in peace.Action is great in this film. If you like survival type films, then this film is for you.Overall a spectacular film. Perhaps the most under rated film I know of. Highly recommend it.

Although this is not the first time this has ever been seen -- remember Kentucky Fried Movie by the Zucker Bros. came out years earlier -- it is the first time it has been seen in the mainstream. The first time I saw the movie, I was 8 yrs. old and laughed my head off for its immature humor. I still enjoy this movie today (also because of its immature humor) because things that were way over my head at that age, I laugh at now. (Although I saw it in the theater at age 8, it is not recommended entirely for that audience). This movie has become a part of our popular culture. This movie has a staying power that is measured in quotability, kind of like The Big Lebowski or Saturday Night Live skits are. Think of how many times you can slip Surely, you can't be serious into conversations and have somebody know enough to answer Stop calling me Shirley. It entertains every time you see it, because you might catch a detail that you missed or didn't remember from the time before. Excellent comedy that launched the genre that is hit or miss with several other filmmakers. Also permanently typecast Leslie Nielsen as a goof ball, slapstick comic actor. You can even call a Leslie Nielsen Movie its own genre starting with this film.

Yet after the first few scenes I was drawn in.The thoughtful, almost classic literature-like dialog all throughout this movie simply make it a masterpiece. The cast are the key in any such film, and everybody delivers here, especially Anthony Hopkins. The characters truly interact with each other, and you never feel like you've lost a step, you never think that the feelings portrayed are not credible.The story is endearing, it has a few funny dark comedy moments, but most of all it simply gives an overall good feeling to the viewer. I've read some negative comments regarding the length, all I can tell you is, until I read the comments I never even realized it is three hours long. I had to check the box of my DVD to confirm that it is indeed of the said length.I also can not finish this comment without giving some extra love for the performance of Jeffrey Tambor (as Quince). He nailed the role down to the last twitch of the thumb. The klutz loving husband who has always got the side of his wife and his family is absolutely the most lovable character of the movie, and everyone understands that he would even be one of death's favorites. An absolute must see movie.PS On a side note I would like to mention that this movie has to be watched in the original English speaking version.

(Hey, call me stupid, but this is a fact.) Given that, it became one of my favorite movies.On the 4th viewing, I saw the entire film from the beginning and... Oh, what a difference! This film does not need the first hour to be good. If, on my first viewing, I had begun at the beginning, I probably would not have watched it at all.My verdict Hollywood screwed up.If you get a chance to see this film on the tube, I advise you to tune in one hour late. And enjoy!
