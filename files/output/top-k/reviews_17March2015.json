[{"date":"17 March 2015","score":"","review":" Remake of the classic Gone In 60 Seconds (1974). looked promising but for me this wasn't a good flick. The first hour is talking and talking and a bit of act and mouse with the police who know something is going on. After one hour this flick slowly moves into a bit of action but it's waiting until the end to see the best, The Ford Mustang Shelby GT-500. that chase is worth seeing as are the other cars throughout this flick. The problem was that I was more into the expensive Italian cars and the muscle cars then into the actual story itself. Not really my thing storywise although I always liked the acting of Cage. For me Need For Speed (2014)was much better with a better story and directing. Still, if you are into flicks with cars then this is it, but if you dig action like Fast and Furious franchise you won't get it here, sadly.Gore 0\/5 Nuidty 0\/5 Effects 2\/5 Story 2\/5 Comedy 0\/5 ","genre":null},{"date":"17 March 2015","score":"","review":" Remake of the classic Gone In 60 Seconds (1974). looked promising but for me this wasn't a good flick.

Nothing too slick and I don't want everyone in the remake to be gorgeous but seriously...it needs a remake. Also, my husband came up with a much better ending than the one here.So...nice scenery, including a ridiculously good-looking Max Schell, but Ms. Mercouri nearly ruined this movie. She was just too weird. Was she supposed to be alluring? I just found her to be scary looking and I couldn't believe these guys would be falling all over her. I don't mean to be catty...I'm actually older than she was when she made this film but I'm still calling her out on being a little too witch- like. That voice! Like a much-later Lucille Ball after a couple of packs of cigarettes. Puh-leeze.

It's a film made at the tail-end of the 1970s replete with that fine '70s atmosphere. And atmosphere is what this film is all about; it creates a truly sinister look and feel as it depicts what happens to the innocent Lutz family after they move into a house that was the site of a previous massacre. From the title cards telling us the days of the week (building up a fine sense of foreboding) to the constant weird things going on, this film is predictable and entertainingly so. Swarms of bluebottles appearing out of nowhere, a sinister hidden room in the basement, a priest haunted by a sinister spirit, a weird pig-creature in the window, blood pouring down the walls, a crucifix turning upside down, a guy getting possessed by a killer spirit and more besides&#x85;what's not to love here? Okay, so the film has some rough edges. For the most part, though, it's surprisingly undated, especially as the special effects are kept simple and down to earth. The cast is also decent I don't like Margot Kidder, but she gives a suitably scared turn here, although Christian Bale look-alike James Brolin has the stand-out turn as the guy becoming increasingly deranged. Rod Steiger is good value, as always, as the priest enduring a run of extremely bad luck.I first saw this film a good decade ago and found it creepy and powerful and seeing it now in the modern age I find it just as creepy, with the demonic voice shouting 'get out!' still the scary highlight. Up there with THE ENTITY and POLTERGEIST as the best this genre has to offer. This is also one of the rare instances in which the remake (released in 2005) manages to be as good, if not better, as the original.
