But he was not so feeble-minded as to claim that somehow all of our fears of dying, our fears of the universe, the outrage resident deep in our souls that we just simply have NO idea how we got here, where we are going, or WHY; somehow, magically, all of that is forgotten and we are truly calm and tranquil now because we literally see a bunch of black planar solids flying around in formation that beam a multi-lingual radio signal of peace to earth.On the other hand, what would it take?

This resulted, naturally, in an enormous hype connected with the movie. Therefore, I had great expectations, when I went to the theatre to see it. Luckily, I was not too much disappointed. The movie was a beautifully controlled comedy, with excellent cast, astounding costumes and a sweet and delightful screenplay. In a movie a well-considered cast is of greatest importance. In my opinion, Joseph Fiennes, who is the leading actor, shows a great depth in his role as Will Shakespeare. He does not overplay and his accent and charisma is outstanding. It is definitely his breakthrough-role, and I think that he, in time, will be an accepted artist. The character, William Shakespeare, is well made, even though he does not develop much throughout the story. Nevertheless, it is great to see how Viola De Lesseps affects his competence of writing. Shakespeare is not capable of making any progress with his life on his own. He needs help from his lover and his friends. Among his friends it is significant to mention Ned Alleyn, who is played by Ben Affleck. Ned is the leader of a small theatre company, as travels around England to get jobs where available. This, alongside with many other things, tells a lot about the theatre line of business at the end of the 16th century. I can also mention that only male actors where allowed to perform at that time, which the film also points out. Finally, the film tells about for instance a priest's point of view. It is clearly that the priest finds the two theatres in London as a profanation. The above-mentioned examples indicate that Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard had done their homework, the description of the theatres and actors is very similar to the way it really happened in those days. Gwyneth Paltrow, who got an Oscar for best actress in a leading role, is playing a double role. She is both playing the noble Viola De Lesseps and the actor (!) Thomas Kent. As Viola De Lesseps, she is, besides being gorgeous, very convincing. You cannot help but sympathise with her all the way through the movie. Viola is a strong character, and she is not the typical, noble snob. She has a great heart, and her feelings about Will are true. Unfortunately, her destiny is already decided for her. She knows that she cannot prevent it. Therefore, I think the ending of the movie is excellent. It would be too much Hollywood, if Will and Viola had each other at the end. In the 16th century such marriages could not take place, and this is being told in a simple but heartbreaking way in the movie. The last character I will mention is Queen Elizabeth played by Judi Dench. Dench got an Oscar for the Best Actress in a supporting Role for this role. This is, in my opinion, also understandable. She acts very solemnly in the movie, and when she speaks, she really shows her huge authority. Elizabeth, as a character, seems to be a good queen and also very generous. She sees that Viola will not be happy with her fiancé, Lord Wessex, and she understands Viola's affair with Shakespeare. Maybe the queen is a bit too nice; I do not think that a real queen would act like she does in the ending. Nevertheless, there is something about the queen, as you cannot put a finger on, which is - of course - the costumes! On the contrary, the script is not that good. It is filled with clichés and small laughs, where some of them seem unnecessary. It is a romantic comedy, I know, but why is it not possible to write a script that really takes the viewers breath away. I have seen quite a few love comedies, and I have very seldom been positively surprised by the plotline. Shakespeare in Love is a wonderful film, but all in all, it does, due to the script, fall in to the category of mainstream movies. It will never be a classic, as for instance Shawshank Redemption and Shindler's List or if I should mention a love story Casablanca and Good Will Hunting. The themes as the film tries to point out are easily interpreted. One of the themes is, as mentioned before, the life of an actor or playwright in London in the 16th century. Another theme is the romance between a poor, no-good playwright and the noble countess; such relationship is of course a taboo. It is an overused theme, which we last saw in James Cameron's  epic lovestory Titanic. In fact Shakespeare in Love can be compared to Titanic in many ways, as the two films have many things in common. The small jokes, the differences between rich and poor, the hype surrounding the movies and of course the Academy Award for the Best Movie, which certainly shows what way Hollywood are going these years. I do not think that Shakespeare in Love or Titanic deserved that Oscar. In 1997 it should have been L.A. Confidential, which is a crime movie with several plot turns; a real movie, or Good Will Hunting, which has maybe one of the best scripts ever written. In 1998 there can not be much doubt that Saving Private Ryan was the absolutely best movie, maybe together with Life is Beautiful. Life is Beautiful is, as Shakespeare in Love, a romantic comedy, it is just that Life is Beautiful is funnier, has a more interesting plot and, maybe mostly important for a lovestory, it is much more touching!When this has been said, I think it is time to make my conclusion. First of all, I think it is a very good movie. The acting is almost perfect, and the costumes, photography and music are of very high standards. The script is okay, but could certainly have been better, not to mention the dialogues that are somewhat naive, mainly because of the small jokes and clichés. Altogether, Shakespeare in Love has scenes as form a synthesis. You cannot help but be amazed, when you see the love scene, where Viola and Shakespeare, has a narrative dialogue from Romeo and Juliet, while the camera moves softly around the bed and the most beautiful music flights towards your ear as carried by wings of angels! At the end of the 16th century Shakespeare wrote a beautiful play. At the end of the 20th century John Madden made a film about it, but - alas - it was not as good as the work of the true master - not as good as the never forgettable William Shakespeare.Rating 8\/10  ","genre":null},{"date":"28 September 1999","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  First and foremost, I would like to point out that Shakespeare in Love got 5 Academy Awards, including Best Movie.

This resulted, naturally, in an enormous hype connected with the movie. Therefore, I had great expectations, when I went to the theatre to see it. Luckily, I was not too much disappointed. The movie was a beautifully controlled comedy, with excellent cast, astounding costumes and a sweet and delightful screenplay. In a movie a well-considered cast is of greatest importance. In my opinion, Joseph Fiennes, who is the leading actor, shows a great depth in his role as Will Shakespeare. He does not overplay and his accent and charisma is outstanding. It is definitely his breakthrough-role, and I think that he, in time, will be an accepted artist. The character, William Shakespeare, is well made, even though he does not develop much throughout the story. Nevertheless, it is great to see how Viola De Lesseps affects his competence of writing. Shakespeare is not capable of making any progress with his life on his own. He needs help from his lover and his friends. Among his friends it is significant to mention Ned Alleyn, who is played by Ben Affleck. Ned is the leader of a small theatre company, as travels around England to get jobs where available. This, alongside with many other things, tells a lot about the theatre line of business at the end of the 16th century. I can also mention that only male actors where allowed to perform at that time, which the film also points out. Finally, the film tells about for instance a priest's point of view. It is clearly that the priest finds the two theatres in London as a profanation. The above-mentioned examples indicate that Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard had done their homework, the description of the theatres and actors is very similar to the way it really happened in those days. Gwyneth Paltrow, who got an Oscar for best actress in a leading role, is playing a double role. She is both playing the noble Viola De Lesseps and the actor (!) Thomas Kent. As Viola De Lesseps, she is, besides being gorgeous, very convincing. You cannot help but sympathise with her all the way through the movie. Viola is a strong character, and she is not the typical, noble snob. She has a great heart, and her feelings about Will are true. Unfortunately, her destiny is already decided for her. She knows that she cannot prevent it. Therefore, I think the ending of the movie is excellent. It would be too much Hollywood, if Will and Viola had each other at the end. In the 16th century such marriages could not take place, and this is being told in a simple but heartbreaking way in the movie. The last character I will mention is Queen Elizabeth played by Judi Dench. Dench got an Oscar for the Best Actress in a supporting Role for this role. This is, in my opinion, also understandable. She acts very solemnly in the movie, and when she speaks, she really shows her huge authority. Elizabeth, as a character, seems to be a good queen and also very generous. She sees that Viola will not be happy with her fiancé, Lord Wessex, and she understands Viola's affair with Shakespeare. Maybe the queen is a bit too nice; I do not think that a real queen would act like she does in the ending. Nevertheless, there is something about the queen, as you cannot put a finger on, which is - of course - the costumes! On the contrary, the script is not that good. It is filled with clichés and small laughs, where some of them seem unnecessary. It is a romantic comedy, I know, but why is it not possible to write a script that really takes the viewers breath away. I have seen quite a few love comedies, and I have very seldom been positively surprised by the plotline. Shakespeare in Love is a wonderful film, but all in all, it does, due to the script, fall in to the category of mainstream movies. It will never be a classic, as for instance Shawshank Redemption and Shindler's List or if I should mention a love story Casablanca and Good Will Hunting. The themes as the film tries to point out are easily interpreted. One of the themes is, as mentioned before, the life of an actor or playwright in London in the 16th century. Another theme is the romance between a poor, no-good playwright and the noble countess; such relationship is of course a taboo. It is an overused theme, which we last saw in James Cameron's  epic lovestory Titanic. In fact Shakespeare in Love can be compared to Titanic in many ways, as the two films have many things in common. The small jokes, the differences between rich and poor, the hype surrounding the movies and of course the Academy Award for the Best Movie, which certainly shows what way Hollywood are going these years. I do not think that Shakespeare in Love or Titanic deserved that Oscar. In 1997 it should have been L.A. Confidential, which is a crime movie with several plot turns; a real movie, or Good Will Hunting, which has maybe one of the best scripts ever written. In 1998 there can not be much doubt that Saving Private Ryan was the absolutely best movie, maybe together with Life is Beautiful. Life is Beautiful is, as Shakespeare in Love, a romantic comedy, it is just that Life is Beautiful is funnier, has a more interesting plot and, maybe mostly important for a lovestory, it is much more touching!When this has been said, I think it is time to make my conclusion. First of all, I think it is a very good movie. The acting is almost perfect, and the costumes, photography and music are of very high standards. The script is okay, but could certainly have been better, not to mention the dialogues that are somewhat naive, mainly because of the small jokes and clichés. Altogether, Shakespeare in Love has scenes as form a synthesis. You cannot help but be amazed, when you see the love scene, where Viola and Shakespeare, has a narrative dialogue from Romeo and Juliet, while the camera moves softly around the bed and the most beautiful music flights towards your ear as carried by wings of angels! At the end of the 16th century Shakespeare wrote a beautiful play. At the end of the 20th century John Madden made a film about it, but - alas - it was not as good as the work of the true master - not as good as the never forgettable William Shakespeare.Rating 8\/10  ","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"28 September 1999","score":"","review":"  Because it features a slew of sharp-tongued characters with a complex plot and a retro soundtrack, suddenly Lock, Stock, And Two Smoking Barrels is a rip-off?

The argument that the Germans during the war were not on the bad side is wrong.  That they, on a grunt level, were also just kids stuck in a war is true.  Spielberg does not show this for a reason, he's honoring the sacrifice and victory of our fallen Americans in the war.  The battle scenes are incredible pieces of gut wrenching artistry and the chaotic slaughter of the first 20 minutes means something to the story, but that story fails at achieving its more provocative, yet slightly out of focus ideas.  The ideas are there, and they can be reached through the important viel of the film's realism.  But Spielberg, for all his visual brilliance does not make it work.  In fact, it seems like he is constantly trying to cloud over our thoughts that may come out of the film with a scene that is meant to close out a story that should not be ended so easily.  The men fought and died and lived through that hell for the world we live in today, but instead of letting us contemplate the worth of that sacrifice and allowing those moments of horror to manifest themselves in our minds along side the lives we, as the generations born into that infant world which have taken advantage of this age, Speilberg (and or the screenwriter) has ended the story of that sacrifice.  Ryan works as a metaphor for the men who lived to go home and rebuild, or build lives. But that metaphor has a serious flaw when the character is shown finalizing his internal conflict.  Well, with that, it seems less of a thanks to a generation.  Tom hanks, on the other hand, gives one of his best performances, so does Tom Sizemore (with what little he had to work with). Everyone else overacts.  No kidding.  The dialogue is very bland and repetitive.  Spielberg and Hanks lend them power, but that doesn't hide the awkwardness.  I enjoyed the interested paradox of having an incredibly violent war film be patriot.  It shows us the horror and nobility, both right next to each other, hand in hand.  It shows men facing their own deaths as individuals as a greater good stands in the shadows, but almost completely out of site.  That is important, this is one of the first films to do that.  But there's a better way of characterizing the men than giving them each a monologue in the minutes before the final battle, or simple stereotype characteristics.  Yet this was not what I was thinking when I first saw the film.  As an experience the film works, and like a great film, it stays with you.  But the more I thought about it, the more its moral and metaphorical problems came to the surface.  It's definitely worth seeing, maybe even twice, but it will never provoke its ideas on a deeper level than the logistic banter of the men.  It's almost too visceral.  For more ideas, see The Thin Red Line.  the too films both try to say the same thing (one with a flag, the other with the Earth we fight over), but one succeeds where the other comes just within reach, but not artistically gutsey enough to grab hold and run. They are both about Human dignity in the face of the inhumane.  One encompasses the WWII generation, the other encompasses the entire human race.  We've seen violence, and if we're not trying to survive it, we should be thinking about why it is.  Only then can we overcome it. It's a noble gesture, but impossible.

It also has straight characters, characters who are not sure about their sexuality, people who are searching for some truth about their existence.  This is not a film about sexual orientation.  It's about loneliness and the difficulty human beings often experience in connecting to one another.  Filmically, Denys Arcand cleverly balances the various dimensions of the relationships and the contrasting, constantly shifting relationships.  The serial killer element is a bit less successful (it feels more like a way to wrap up various plot points and, unlike the rest of the film, is thematically heavy-handed).  Thomas Gibson centers and grounds the film; it's a quiet performance but behind the handsome, arrogant exterior he slowly reveals a terrified soul afraid of showing or accepting love from those around him.  The supporting cast is strong, especially Mia Kirshner as Gibson's friend, a dom-for-hire with precognitive powers.  Her role is more metaphor than a literal conceit---strangely innocent and depraved at the same time, she represents the light and dark of the characters' sexual consciousness. The film's involving and often surprises in its character development.  The effect is somewhat like Robert Altman directing a David Mamet script---the dialogue doesn't shrink from some searing observations aside from a few contrived moments in the beginning.  Often, in our search for love and a conventional relationship, we ignore the love that already exists around us---in our friends, family, those who are able to see us as we are.  Arcand and the writer, Brad Fraser, make some canny observations on the different ways human beings try to escape and deny their loneliness and how that denial returns to haunt us in so many unexpected ways.This film is a rewarding experience.  It may not be for bigots who can't get past the sexual orientation of some of the characters to see the greater, transcendental message of hope and redemption.  Loneliness is a universal experience.  A film like this, that dares to explore the darker side of our lives with a clever and perceptive eye, deserves applause and an open-minded approach.

Like so many of his later features it is saddled with a highly suspect plot that is driven by a set of poor decisions made by a handful of characters of such alarmingly low emotional intelligence it is a miracle they survive the first half of the film at all, yet it works. It keeps company with the likes of Strangers On A Train, Psycho, Rear Window, The Thirty-Nine Steps, North by North-West, The Lady Vanishes it is a classic. It is tempting to put it all down to Ingrid Bergman's portrayal of Alicia Hubberman - which is  faultless - but Bergman alone could not have made Notorious what it is she also starred in Spellbound and Under Capricorn and was unable to save either of those films from limping into mediocrity. It is also appealing to suggest the obvious that it is the combination of breathtaking cinematography, flawless supporting cast and Ben Hecht's cracking script that make it so good.  But I believe that the primary reason Notorious excels is because of the abiding friendship, professional respect and unrequited love that existed between Alfred Hitchcock and Ingrid Bergman as they stepped up to make the film. The archetypal > themes that comprised their professional partnership inspired, amongst other things, Hitchcock's\/Hecht's Alicia - a woman in a barren marriage desperate for love - and all those tender beautifully lit close-ups. It also allowed Bergman - and here a precedent was broken - to contribute, and to act upon, her insights as to the motivations and behavior of her character.Hitchcock didn't suffer the opinions of his actors lightly, yetwhere Notorious was concerned, he made an exception. For the duration of the shooting of the film, Bergman was Hitchcock's closest collaborator. I have a strong sense that the very thing that could have made Notorious lame - Hitchcock's unrequited love for Bergman - is also the very thing that saved it from obscurity and that we may have much - we will never how much - for which to thank Bergman.There are many moments that make Notorious Bergman's picture, but I think the most extraordinary is the kiss outside the wine cellar. In all her films, Bergman always brought a vulnerability to her love scenes that imbued them with a real sense of intimacy, and Notorious is no exception think of her in the infamous balcony scene or during her final descent down the staircase.  Yet when Dev - ever the mercenary genius of improvisation - makes full use of Rains' approach and, pulling Alicia to him as they stand outside the wine cellar, orders her to kiss him, Bergman actually surpasses her own track record.Suddenly in the arms of the man she really loves she is overcome with emotion; and for one second, maybe two, she separates her mouth from his, and in an attempt to give voice to the indescribable and to forge, experience and register a moment of pure intimacy, she utters one word, his name,  'Dev!' and all hell breaks loose. Never in the history of cinema has one word carried such an erotic charge. They could not be closer. He doesn't flinch. They barely move, but it is all there. And it's not just her voice, it is also her eyebrows. Just as she utters his name, Bergman furrows them. They tremble. They, along with her tremulous whisper, betray her true feelings, so that within the space of two seconds we witness Bergman experience both the heightened rush of intense sexual desire as well as the instantaneous relief afforded her by the act of surrender to it.All this with one word - 'Dev' - and the furrowing of a pair of eyebrows. So much emotion conveyed with so little and in such a brief period of time.It is because of moments like these that Notorious is timeless - the film gets under your skin and into your psyche - and given the history of the film and her beautiful performance at the center of it, it is fitting that it should be Bergman  ","genre":null},{"date":"28 September 1999","score":"6 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":"  Notorious is one of my favorite Hitchcock films.

With Deep Blue Sea he shows that he can still make movies that aren't flops. DBS was and is a success. The film is filled with great action scenes and moments that make you go wow. I recommend this film to anyone who likes action movies even a teeny weeny bit.In this film we get to see what happens when the genetically manipulated sharks go rebel. Against humans of course. This takes place in an underwater research facility Argonautica. We get to see how the sharks kill staff members one by one. And we get to see it with great special effects. The robot shark is fantastic and the computer-made sharks aren't so bad as they say. To put it all together, this is a must-see.9\/10 - Way to go Renny!

Lets start with the performances. Sean Penn and Christopher Walken deliver the best work of their careers. Christopher Walken is bold and brilliant as the estranged criminal father and Sean Penn plays the delinquent son with a quiet cool. The supporting cast is outstanding as well including Chris Penn as the simple minded tag-along younger brother. Moving on to the technical side. The direction by James Foley is innovative to say the least(you should also check out another Foley film Glengarry Glenn Ross). Foley takes this story about crime in the heartland and makes it one of the most coolest looking films ever. The way he uses lighting, angles, and well placed slo-mo is amazing. The film's style and look is similar to Martin Scorsese's 1990 film Good Fellas(another masterpiece), but this film came out a few years before Good Fellas so you can't say Foley was biting Scorsese. I don't want to give away too much of the plot so here's the short and sweet of it. Brad Whitewood(Penn)is kicked out of his house after a fight with his mother's boyfriend and he goes to stay with his father Brad Sr.(Walken) whom he has never really known. Brad then gets caught up in his father's life of crime. He soon realizes he wants nothing to do with his father and his ways, but he finds it hard to leave. This is a sobering tale about family and morality that should not be missed.

Like so many foreign language films, the plot line takes second billing to the marvelous acting and, in this case, to the stunning photography. But the plot is strong enough to carry the story along and get and keep you interested. We quickly grow to like and be concerned about the two lead characters, and I loved the way their relationship developed without the sugary sweetness too common in American films.For me, an especially great part of the film was the photography of Brazil -- the beautiful colors and images made a tremendous impression on me. (Personal aside -- I'm redecorating my house at the moment and I kept pausing the film to announce that's the color I want the walls to be!)One other thing I love about this film is that it is so typically un-American. Here, we would have cast Sharon Stone or some other gorgeous woman to play the lead. Only in foreign films do they dare casting people (particularly women) who look REAL!
