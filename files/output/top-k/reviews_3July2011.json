I don't care if it is supposed to be a cult movie. Nor do I care if many people love it. It is just stupid and overrated. And this, my friends, is not my opinion. It is just pure and simple FACT. That is right. That is what I wrote. Whoever liked this movie is just wrong. I don't know what would you like in it. The karate is pathetic. The story is ridiculous. The moral is absurd.Now I am going to write a few SPOILERS here, so feel free to skip my review if you haven't seen the movie.First, you see the newcomer in town - the new kid in the school - getting beaten on a regular basis by the Evil Bully - the black belt owner. The reason? Daniel LaRusso interfered in an argument between The Bully and his ex girlfriend. Why? Because he was stupid. What kind of an idiot would interfere into an argument between a girl he has met just a few minutes ago and a totally unknown boy? What kind of an idiot would start a fight with another idiot who is obviously able to crush him like a bug? I mean, Daniel was as skinny as a toothpick and had no fighting experience at all. The Evil Bully was a leader of a bikers' gang - and you can't be a leader of a bikers' gang if you can't fight. If Daniel was not as as dumb as something very, very dumb he would have figured that out. He should have had also figured out that by interfering in their argument he can only make things worse for both of them. How would you feel if you were arguing with your ex and some total stranger interfered? Daniel should have shown some respect to Ali and let her solve her problems with the boy without getting in her way.Second, after the beach incident he became the school wimp. Now tell me, do you really think that the most popular cheer leader in the school would show any sympathy to the school wimp? Would she like him? Even if she liked him would she show it? You know the answer. The answer is NO! No 16 year old girl would risk her reputation because of the school wimp. Not a single one, especially if the school wimp is a total stranger to everybody in the town.Third, Daniel pretended to know karate from the beginning of the movie. You saw him opening a door with a pathetic excuse of a karate kick. I liked to do that too... When I was 5. When I was 16 I already knew that if I say that I can fight and I can't I would get beaten by some bully. I knew that if I pretended to know something that I don't know the result would be devastating to me. Keep in mind that Daniel was not a normal teenager. His mother was single. He was the man in the house so he should have been more experienced than I was at that age. But he was not. He was stupid.Now let's talk about martial arts.First, you do remember the sensei of the Evil Bully, do you? The guy who liked to say The Enemy Deserves No Mercy!!! ARGH!!! Let me tell you one thing. No sensei would keep their dojo if they teach their students like that. Fact. Especially if they teach in a small town where everybody knows everybody. Do you think any parent would let their kids study with a man who turns them into criminals? If you do, then you are just wrong, sorry.Second, there was Miyagi... Who was as much of a karate instructor as the school janitor was. He didn't teach Daniel how to fight. He told him how to wash cars. He trained him to paint fences. He showed him how to dance before the sunset. Do you think that is the way to learn karate? If it was that easy the painters would be the best fighters in the world... However Daniel became an equal fighter to the black belt owners just in two months. That would make any martial artist in the world very angry. You know, it is IMPOSSIBLE for anybody to earn a black belt in just two months. Even if you practice 25 hours a day you just can't do it. Even if you are a God of Karate you can't do it. Yet Daniel did it in just two months washing cars&#x85; Do you know how many kids start visiting martial arts classes because of movies like this? Because of movies showing martial arts as something you can master in a few months. After the kids see that it is actually very hard to earn a black belt and in two months they have learned absolutely nothing they quit the dojo disappointed and with low spirits. Which is actually quite dangerous and that is another reason for me to hate the movie.What is the moral of the movie? Here it isYou don't need to think. You don't have to be smart. You may be a stupid wimp and a poser and people will like you because you are The Protagonist in the movie. You don't have to put any effort if you want to learn something. You don't even have to practice the thing that you want to learn. But you will succeed just because you are The Protagonist of the movie. You will become equal to people who have worked hard for many years because they are Bad and you are Good.END OF THE SPOILERS.The movie probably works as pure entertainment. But you can find better entertainment with another movie &#x96; movie with a better story and a better moral.

He knows he is masterful playing pool, but has no peace within himself unless judged by others. When he engages Minnesota Fats he can't stop playing even though incapacitated unless Minnesota himself frees him to stop. When an inferior hustler slights him, he has to retaliate without any charity to another hustler. He misjudges his first manager (Myron McCormick) who cares for him while his second one does not. He is closest to Sarah whom he can say how he feels about his abilities, but apparently that isn't enough.Sarah Packard (Piper Laurie) - Eddie's love interest.

Whichever way you turn, Fate sticks out a foot to trip you. - It certainly seems that way for Al Roberts in this grim and taut film noir which tells the tale of a dissatisfied New York bar-room piano player destined for bigger things whose vague plans of marrying his girlfriend are ruined when she decides that she wants to move to Hollywood to pursue her dream of becoming an actress. Al later decides to head to Hollywood to be with her when he can't bear to play piano in that bar room any longer without her soothing presence. He sets out to hitchhike the entire way, with very little luck. By the time he reaches Arizona, he is filthy and penniless, and this is where he gets picked up by Charles Haskell Jr, a pill-popping shady character who engages in conversation with Al and tells him that he will take him all the way to LA. Al notices scratches on his hand and wrist, which Haskell reveals were from dealing with the most dangerous animal of all a woman. Inexplicably, Haskell dies in his sleep while Al takes over the wheel. When Al opens the door, Haskell falls out and bashes his head off a rock. Now it looks extremely bad, so instead of reporting it to the police, Al takes Haskell's identity, his clothes and his car, and sets about completing his journey and then abandoning the car. But then he picks up a woman at a gas station, who knew Haskell from a previous journey, and she blackmails Al into keeping up the impersonation or else she will go to the police. Needless to say, things get worse...While the actions of the protagonist are extremely questionable in the logic behind what he does (If your trying to keep a low profile why would you even CONSIDER picking a hitch hiker up??), Detour is still a tremendous film with some fine acting, racy and blunt dialogue and a fast-paced story that twists at every turn. Once said to have been filmed in just six days (Evidence has since come out that has questioned these claims) and filmed on an extremely low-budget, Detour just goes to prove that a brilliant and tense film can be made on such a low-budget. Directed by German director Edgar G. Ulmer, who had before this enjoyed success in Hollywood with The Black Cat, for the infamous Poverty Row studio. Due to the very low-budget, the film had to rely on the director's efficiency and skill to make what ended up being a masterpiece in film noir. All the elements of the infamous and controversial film noir are here; the femme fatal played by Ann Savage in a performance which German filmmaker Wim Wenders called '30 years ahead of it's time', the grim and paranoid atmosphere and the overwhelming sense of despair as Al's situation on the road seems to be getting worse and worse at every turn. Tom Neal, whose career would be ruined after he ended up in prison for murdering his wife, gives a superb performance here as Al; a fast-talking and blunt man who just finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time. He's backed by an matching performance from Ann Savage, whose performance was indeed ahead of it's time.The narration is mesmerizing and really draws you in, here's an example of it here As I drove off, it was still raining and the drops streaked down the windshield like tears. Neal delivers the narration with such passion and belief that it really touches us and contributes to the haunting atmosphere. Detour has never been given a DVD release, due to the copyright expiring on the film leaving it to rot in the public domain, a form of limbo where the films reside with no foreseeable DVD release. Detour is available on line though, and shouldn't be hard to find. It's a superb film with a runtime just over an hour long I highly recommend everyone checks it out. Often hailed as the best Film-Noir, it goes without saying that it deserves a proper DVD release.

He sets out to hitchhike the entire way, with very little luck. By the time he reaches Arizona, he is filthy and penniless, and this is where he gets picked up by Charles Haskell Jr, a pill-popping shady character who engages in conversation with Al and tells him that he will take him all the way to LA. Al notices scratches on his hand and wrist, which Haskell reveals were from dealing with the most dangerous animal of all a woman. Inexplicably, Haskell dies in his sleep while Al takes over the wheel. When Al opens the door, Haskell falls out and bashes his head off a rock. Now it looks extremely bad, so instead of reporting it to the police, Al takes Haskell's identity, his clothes and his car, and sets about completing his journey and then abandoning the car. But then he picks up a woman at a gas station, who knew Haskell from a previous journey, and she blackmails Al into keeping up the impersonation or else she will go to the police. Needless to say, things get worse...While the actions of the protagonist are extremely questionable in the logic behind what he does (If your trying to keep a low profile why would you even CONSIDER picking a hitch hiker up??), Detour is still a tremendous film with some fine acting, racy and blunt dialogue and a fast-paced story that twists at every turn. Once said to have been filmed in just six days (Evidence has since come out that has questioned these claims) and filmed on an extremely low-budget, Detour just goes to prove that a brilliant and tense film can be made on such a low-budget. Directed by German director Edgar G. Ulmer, who had before this enjoyed success in Hollywood with The Black Cat, for the infamous Poverty Row studio. Due to the very low-budget, the film had to rely on the director's efficiency and skill to make what ended up being a masterpiece in film noir. All the elements of the infamous and controversial film noir are here; the femme fatal played by Ann Savage in a performance which German filmmaker Wim Wenders called '30 years ahead of it's time', the grim and paranoid atmosphere and the overwhelming sense of despair as Al's situation on the road seems to be getting worse and worse at every turn. Tom Neal, whose career would be ruined after he ended up in prison for murdering his wife, gives a superb performance here as Al; a fast-talking and blunt man who just finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time. He's backed by an matching performance from Ann Savage, whose performance was indeed ahead of it's time.The narration is mesmerizing and really draws you in, here's an example of it here As I drove off, it was still raining and the drops streaked down the windshield like tears. Neal delivers the narration with such passion and belief that it really touches us and contributes to the haunting atmosphere. Detour has never been given a DVD release, due to the copyright expiring on the film leaving it to rot in the public domain, a form of limbo where the films reside with no foreseeable DVD release. Detour is available on line though, and shouldn't be hard to find. It's a superb film with a runtime just over an hour long I highly recommend everyone checks it out. Often hailed as the best Film-Noir, it goes without saying that it deserves a proper DVD release.

It's a very hard-hitting and shocking film; which goes without saying when you're talking about a Larry Clarke film, whose debut film Kids shook the western world and questioned the culture and well-being of modern teenagers in society. He'd go on after this to make the notorious (and perhaps even more controversial than Kids)Ken Park.This happened in Florida, and in the film, we see the very strange relationship that best friends Bobby (Nick Stahl) and Marty (Brad Renfro) have. They both work together at a deli - and appear to have a kind of homo-erotic relationship - and Bobby is a real bully to his friend. He physically and verbally abuses him on a daily basis. Marty only takes this because it's how it has always been between the two of them. Bobby, strangely, also acts as a type of pimp to Marty, selling his services to gay men at nightclubs, and making him help out in making gay porn films. However, the pair also pick up girls together. They go on a double date with Ali and Lisa, and Marty begins a relationship with Lisa and gets her pregnant. As their relationship grows, Lisa gets sick of seeing her boyfriend being abused by Bobby, and when Bobby rapes Ali, the group decides that enough is enough. They plot to murder him, to get him out of their lives for good.A film starring Keanu Reeves with a similar plot to this was released in 1986 called River's Edge also starring Dennis Hopper. That was a striking film portraying the apathy of youth, but it was also quite boring. Bully is almost twenty times better. From the word go, you know that you are watching a Larry Clarke film. Most of the first forty minutes is sex and nudity, with some very perverted upskirt and nudity shots (Including one where Lisa is urinating; unnecessary? I think so). But once the plotting to murder Bobby starts, it really becomes tense and interesting. Don't get me wrong, I was enjoying the film up until the hour mark. It just really gets better after that, but up until then, in between the sex scenes and all, we had the character development and the scenes where Bobby abuses Marty. Marty looks a lot more aggressive and is a lot more stronger than Bobby, yet he takes this abuse off him and rarely retaliates. It's been this way his whole life he tells his girlfriend. Which goes to show the extent of power that a bully can have over it's victim. The bully in this is a 'friend', in Marty's case, his 'best friend'.I've seen two Larry Clarke films now; Kids and this. Bully is not as hard-hitting or as powerful as Kids - it seems to lack the raw and intense nature of Kids, but it still is an excellent film that stayed with me afterwards. The acting is all superb, it has to be said. Say what you want about Larry Clarke, it can't be denied that the man gets the best out of his young actors in his films. Bijou Phillips and Rachel Miner are superb, but the best performance comes from the brilliant Brad Renfro, who you may recall made quite a stir with his amazing performance in The Client when he was just ten years old. Renfro tragically died of an overdose three years ago at the age of 25; wasted talent. And speaking of wasted talent, everyone remember Leo Fitzpatrick? who played one of the most despicable and disgusting characters to ever grace the screen - Telly, in Kids. Fitzpatrick was almost... too good in that film you could say. I've never seen a performance like it; he was so cool and his own vessel all through that movie. Well, he decided that he didn't like acting after that film - which was his debut, and pretty much disappeared, just appearing in the odd film or TV episode here and there. That was such a shame, because he was so young and had shown such potential in that film. Well Clarke picked him up for this film, where he plays the hit-man Derek Kaufman. Needless to say he steals the show in every scene he is in - again, he is cool and natural and very realistic. It's such a shame that he never found a passion for acting and pursuing a career in it.One thing that confuses me about this film was the apparent homo-erotic relationship between Bobby and Marty. There seemed to be an attraction there, but both of them came across as straight guys. But it comes into question when we see the video tapes that Bobby does be making, trying to sell to shops. And in a very disturbing scene, Bobby makes Ali watch one of the tapes while he rapes her. And this is pretty much what sparks off the plot to murder him - the final straw, in other words. The murder itself is extremely brutal, as Marty and Donnie take turns stabbing him before Kaufman finishes him off with a baseball bat. Kaufman, a self-described hit-man (Leo Fitzpatrick) is recruited into the plot due to his specialty in the field and is acting as an 'advisor' to the crime.Bully is a tough film to watch, albeit it's not as tough or raw as Kids. The first half of the film contains more sex and nudity than Kids did, and almost becomes excessive at times and boring, but it really kicks off just before the hour mark and becomes a suburban nightmare, tainted in the pain and apathy of the youths involved in the crime.

But for every 5 five cheesy action flicks he does, he'll show us he can still act by doing a small engaging character drama. The nephew of famed Godfather director Francis Ford Coppola, Cage delivered arguably his best performance in Leaving Las Vegas. A role that earned him an Academy Award for Best Actor in 1996.8MM was released in 1999 and has been a sort of lost gem that does deserve a second look. A talented supporting cast of Joaquin Phoenix, James Gandolfini & Katherine Keener kicks this film up a few notches. Although the plot and subject matter might turn a few people off. 8MM refers to an old movie reel that is found in the safe of a recently deceased wealthy industrialist. It's a snuff film, where a person is killed on film after being possibly raped or tortured. The elderly widow calls on Cage's character of Tom to investigate the authenticity of the film. Tom is a suburban family man with a wife (Keener) and a baby daughter. He works as a private investigator and after viewing the disturbing film, decides to take the job. Cage usually inhabits these crazy, eccentric characters, but with Tom he grounds him with a quiet professional dignity. As he and a young adult book store employee Max California (Phoenix) dig deeper into the world of underground pornography and fetishism Tom will risk going down a dark path that some people never return. There is a great quote from Max that goes There are some things that you see, and you can't unsee them. Know what I mean? Tom and Max start investigating porn producer Eddie Poole (Gandolfini) and find that he is connected to the making of the snuff film. Tom then visits the murdered girls mother and this is where the film really gets a lot of its heart. The girl was Mary Ann Matthews; a real person and not just some statistic. She is not a forgotten runaway, but a lost girl who drifted too far away from the people who loved her. Tom wants to find the people responsible more for the girl's mother, than for the job he is being paid for. I won't get into the ending or any spoilers, but it could be looked at a few different ways. The plot and story in general needs to be taken as entertainment only.

And because it is a remake it squarely divides people into three categories those who loved the original, those who hated it and those who never saw it.Just like the original, the updated version is a mix of heist movie, cop thriller and romance. It has good directing, a very good cast, an excellent script and good music.Director John McTiernan does a great job. The shots are outstanding, the framing is excellent, the lighting and the positioning of the actors is very good. The moments that require the characters to be deep and thoughtful and interesting are very well done, featuring the director's trademark of cutting actor's faces just below the hairline, a shot that he seems to enjoy very much. A shot that if done right works magic. The passion for carefully framing the shots is a trait he shares with Norman Jewison, the director of the original. Unfortunately, both directors tend to abuse this kind of shots and they rarely and reluctantly let the camera show more than a very tight angle, which practically ruins every single shot that involves high speed action. And this is why I think McTiernan's Rollerball - the other remake based on Norman Jewison's work - was such a failure.The cast is very good. Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo have powerful performances as leads, and Denis Leary has a very good supporting role. Brosnan does a very believable playboy and when compared with McQueen he holds his ground well. His character is a little more sophisticated than the original, and that has been attributed to his days as James Bond. I think the simple truth is that this type of role fits him like a glove. Rene Russo's character is far better and far more believable than that of Faye Dunaway, her maturity working much better for the role of the sophisticated man hunter. Plus her character has a lot more to do and a lot more dept. Leary is great as a balancing counterweight for the pair, even if his character has much less to do than the original. Nonetheless, he is given ample chance to build and develop and that works very well. Faye Dunaway has a tiny role, in recognition of her work in the 1968 version.The script is far superior to the original and it manages to keep the viewer interested and entertained for the duration, trimming out some of the boring or awkward parts. Nevertheless, there are small passages that are taken from the original, shot for shot, word for word. The parts the two leads play require them to display more passion, to generate more tension and generally show a much broader range of emotion, which makes their story heartwarming and endearing. Were the first movie started strong but then went to sleep, the remake manages to keep going strong, even if it lags somewhat after the introduction. One strong point of the remake was how it dealt with the changes in technology and economic realities. A weaker point would be the problems with script believability, an area where it plays fast and loose but that's OK, because so did the original. The game of chess in the first movie was replaced by a much more sophisticated game of cat and mouse, and the movie is not shy about showing all the thrills, tension, fun and emotion that go with it.The music is good and it complements the action well. It is as much a character as it was in the first movie, only a lot less loud. It could be said that the music and some of the long sequences of empty space in the middle could have been cut down a little, but they stop short of becoming long and boring. Plus they are visually beautiful.The Thomas Crown Affair. A very good remake, that still keeps a lot of the original. 9\/10.

But I guess that doesn't have much to do with their devotion. It is what he represented.This is a good movie, and don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with John Wayne's performance. After 30 years in the business, Wayne had obviously learned a thing or two, and was no longer the tall, stiff youngster with the deer in the headlight look of his early 1930s work. By 1956 he was famous, and comfortable on the screen and in his own skin. But he wasn't playing Ethan Edwards, he was playing John Wayne, just like he did in most movies. This isn't Wayne's best work, and it certainly isn't director John Ford's. There is a too obvious attempt at making a sweeping epic based on a plot that is too thin and characterizations that are too weak. The only parts with any depth are Wayne's and Jeffrey Hunter's. And, frankly, the time line doesn't make any sense to me. How did they manage to spend so many years searching for this little girl who was a grown woman when they found her? Yet he only wrote one letter in five years, apparently the length of the search. Even five years doesn't make sense. And where the heck were they? It doesn't snow in Texas. And where did the deserts come from?OK, so Wayne's character doesn't like Indians, and the movie hints that he is a racist. But we don't see him act out this racism overtly, mainly just subtle looks of disgust. And we don't encounter enough good Indians to make his racist attitudes seem foolish, although there is Look, whom he treated with respect. If you had family killed by Indians, not liking Indians seems fairly reasonable, rather than racist, at least by 19th century standards. If he had been an overt racist who changed his attitude in the course of the search due to encounters with good Indians, this movie would have had some depth. But I don't see the characters evolving much, aside from his gaining respect for Martin Pawley, who is 1\/8th (or 1\/4th?) Indian. Some people talk about the great directing here, and in the commentary track I heard some interesting points about technique. But you shouldn't need someone to explain to you why you should like a movie, especially a Western. The cinematography was excellent, but how many times have we seen pretty much the same buttes and plains in countless other Westerns? For those who didn't grow up on Westerns and TV dinners I suppose it would have greater impact. I remember seeing The Searchers years ago, and thinking, it's OK, and my opinion has not improved with age. It's just a Western, and a fairly average one.If you want to see a far more creative Western with Wayne and John Ford directing, try The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (which also features Vera Miles). And they did The Quiet Man. Stagecoach was a classic, but Wayne was a young and weaker actor. My favorite Wayne movie is The Shootist. His worst is probably Rooster Cogburn.The John Ford movie I have enjoyed watching more than any other is Mr. Roberts, which also has Ward Bond and Ken Curtis in quite different roles. It was also swan song for the great William Powell. Hank Worden's performance here as a genial idiot is interesting in light of his studying engineering at Stanford. It is a reminder that real actors are not always what they appear to be on screen. And John Wayne was, perhaps, a different person in private.

It was also swan song for the great William Powell. Hank Worden's performance here as a genial idiot is interesting in light of his studying engineering at Stanford. It is a reminder that real actors are not always what they appear to be on screen. And John Wayne was, perhaps, a different person in private. But I cannot think of any other famous actor who got so much mileage out of playing one screen persona for so long, although Hugh One Grin Grant is in the running, if he lives long enough. John Wayne was famous for playing John Wayne. ","genre":"Adventure, Drama, Western"},{"date":"3 July 2011","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" What an awful film.

In the case of Midnight Run, Robert De Niro and Charles Grodin are unlikely bedfellows as a bail bounty-hunter and his bail-jumper accountant who used to keep the books on a mobster who runs drug rings in Chicago and Las Vegas (where else?). Jack Walsh (De Niro) has been hired by a sleazy bail bond firm in Los Angeles to bring back Jonathan the Duke Mardukas (Grodin) in 72 hours or everyone turns into pumpkins. His bounty is worth $100,000, partially because the firm put up nearly one half a million dollars for the bail. If Grodin isn't brought back in time, the courts will keep the bail money and the firm will be out of business.However, it turns out there are other parties involved who also want Mardukas. The mild-mannered accountant had been keeping the books on the mob for several years but didn't realize he was doing it for Jimmy Serrano, one of the most notorious drug king-pins in Chicago. Before the events of the movie, Mardukas, upon realizing his involvement, embezzled millions of the mob's drug money but made the fatal mistake of sending postcards to Serrano bragging about how he was using the money to fund charitable causes. He was arrested for being party to the mob but later skipped out on bail.The story begins with De Niro being hired to track down Mardukas to bring him back to Los Angeles, although the mob might try to assassinate him before any kind of legal proceedings. Grodin still has in his possession all the goods on the mob, their racketeering, etc. So the mob decides they want Grodin before he is returned to custody. Then add to the mix the FBI who also gets into the act decides they need Grodin to help build their case against Serrano. If that isn't enough, the bail bond firm, distrusting De Niro, hires yet another sleazy bounty hunter, Marvin, who also wants to get Grodin for the payback money.Walsh finds Mardukas at a mundane New York apartment with his wife. The original plan is to take him to LA via a plane, but Mardukas claims that he suffers from a fear of flying and forces them to take a cross-country trip. Midnight Run is essentially a cross between several genres a cross-country chase movie, a comedy, a buddy movie, an action movie. Not unlike the road movies of the 1940's, the two characters end up in all kinds of strange locales across the United States, from Chicago suburbs to the Arizona desert. They go by passenger trains, stolen cars, even a cargo train.Aside from the essential plot, which is a bit fantastical in retrospect but plausible enough to suspend your disbelief during the course of the movie, the real gem is the relationship between De Niro and Grodin. I don't think these actors had ever played in a film before this pairing and yet they seem strangely natural together. De Niro as Walsh is the cigarette-smoking hard-talking urbanite who looks like his clothes were laundered last in the 1970's. By contrast, Grodin is the soft-spoken suburbanite accountant who thinks in terms of practical decisions, the complete opposite from De Niro. During the entire film, Grodin needles De Niro about his habits and eventually his relationships, including his ex-wife and daughter. At first the two dislike one another, particularly De Niro towards Grodin, but by the end something has changed.A really fun movie, a bit mad-cap in places, but the real treasure is the chemistry between De Niro and Grodin. Throughout the movie, there are several ongoing jokes, but the one that stands out is maybe in the next life, meaning that De Niro and Grodin could have been friends under different circumstances. Although I wouldn't go as far as to say this is a terribly deep movie, it's almost perfect escapist fair.

Here's a mathematical demonstration that would have made Sir Bevedere proud  let's admit, by hypothesis, that there was one limit NI that comedy could never exceed. Now, what is the definition of comedy? According to the Oxford dictionary, it's a professional entertainment consisting of jokes and sketches, intended to make an audience laugh. Now, if NI existed, that would mean that there would be no comedic purposes in anything above that Nl level, which indirectly means that there's absolutely no one who would ever laugh to any subject implying the use of comedy above the Nu &#x85; sorry the NI level, in other words, anything above the Nl level could be admitted as 100% serious. But consider that total seriousness is so psychologically oppressive that it inevitably implies the use of a comical element to relieve the tension. And the use of a comic relief is even more necessary in a totally serious narrative. So, from a reductio-ad-absurdum, I've demonstrated that even in the existence of a limit above which we can't laugh, we realize that not only we can, but we should. Quod Erat Demonstratum. Whatever seriousness you build, whatever order you create, it's meant to collapse. That's the principle, the one I call &#x85; 3\/ The 'Castle of Cards' principle The castle of cards has only one goal in its short existence, to collapse. It's the perfect demonstration of the ephemeral essence of any organized and perfectly structured entity. And the higher it gets, the closer is the cataclysm. What's that to mean? Monty Python & the Holy Grail highlights the eternal victory of anarchy over order, and how even anarchy can be appealing. It's a perfect assemblage of chaotic situations, that gets your mind acclimated to the so universal and true unpredictability of life. Nothing can surprise you, yet everything is absolutely surprising  a three-headed knight, a black knight who continues the fight even if he's totally chopped off, a witch with a fake noise, a castle full of virgins with nymphomaniac impulses, a harmless bunny that can decapitate you in one second, and one of the worst cases of cinematic party pooping ever. Everything is built up until it dramatically ends in one of the most brilliantly abrupt endings, demonstrating the inevitable destruction of every measurable structure. World was created from chaos and it will end up in chaos in such a pointlessness that absurdity is the only language that could define it.

In all these sequences, the audience can hear a ubiquitous peppy Beverly Hills Cop-like pop number in the background that's quite sucky to be frank. Otherwise, the movie is a breezer, not a strain-on-the-brain but ain't too witty too. The story well, is like Lady Gaga's 'Judas' music video, cartoonish and flippant, not to forget abundant with clichés. The dialogs range from pleasers like I feel the need, the need for Speed' to random throwaways like Val's 'Tom and Goose are ladies' joke. Maverick, for a complex, larger than life man isn't just quite so, since the only thing arcane about him is the story of his father. Tom Cruise can make  Maverick sound laughable at moments ( he doesn't have that strong, bellowing grunt that an air commander has) but does it reasonably well in other scenes which require more of his 'boy-next-door' charm. Kelly McGillis does her job fine, but the chemistry between Tom and Gillis is weird, because at times it seems like a teenage-romance when it's not. That's where the director and writer are to be blamed for having the silly elevator-all- smiling-scene. Age-factor is inconsistent throughout since all the characters can't be less than 25 but act in some shots like 'Grease' kids.

Soon New York City is overrun with various ghouls and goblins as Judgement Day might be coming and it's up to the group to try and stop it. GHOSTBUSTERS was made as a summer blockbuster but it went way beyond your typical blockbuster style and ended up becoming one of the greatest comedies ever made. It could be argued that the cast and director were never better in their careers and that all of them were at the top of their game while making this picture. I think a great deal of the credit has to go to the screenplay, which mixes in the special effects with some very sly dialogue that really makes you believe everything you're seeing. The paranormal aspects of the story are so well done that you can easily accept what's going on and this here takes care of the adventure side of the story. The screenplay really goes all out when it comes to the comedy as we get one non-stop laugh after another because the dialogue always has our characters winking at the viewer and especially the character played by Murray. While all of the performances are great it's clearly Murray's show as he works wonders with the womanizer who has a smart reply to anything going on. Seeing Murray work the dialogue the way he does and the way he brings humor to his part is something truly remarkable to watch because he makes it seem so easy. Both Aykroyd and Ramis are also at the top of their game and the trio really do work extremely well together and in the end they could be called one of the most memorable comedies teams in the history of cinema. Even the smaller roles are played to perfection with Sigourney Weaver as one of the clients, Rick Moranis as her nerdy neighbor, Annie Potts as the wise-cracking receptionist and Ernie Hudson as the fourth worker. THe special effects hold up extremely well today even when you compare them to the recent CGI trend. Just take a look at Slimer to see how perfect the visual effects are but it's also important that these creatures are so memorable as they also add an additional bit of life to the film. Slimer is in the movie just a matter of minutes and yet he too became rather legendary in his own right. GHOSTBUSTERS is about as flawless as a comedy can get as we get pretty much everything you'd want in a picture like this. There have been many films to come along since but none of them have contained the amount of magic, charm and just all out fun as what you get.

It's ultraviolent even for today's standards and also quite unsettling the way such awful acts are being committed with a surreal flair and with such weird humour! The most controversial and famed part obviously being the iconic Singin' in the Rain whilst raping a woman. You don't know whether to laugh or gasp in shock. In the end you find yourself doing a bit of both! The directing is so alive and full of unusual techniques and it comes together so beautifully and almost perfect.Kubrick is obviously known for his exceptional films such as The Shining which is another horror masterpiece I adore.
