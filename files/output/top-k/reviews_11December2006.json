Such is the success of this approach that he has been elected the chairman of the Headmaster's Association and is due to give a speech to the association in Norwich. A simple mix up over right and left sees him miss his train and also miss a lift from his wife. A chance encounter with one of his sixth form in a car sees him able to beg a lift from her but that only causes more panic and confusion with his wife and the girl's parents assuming that he is in a relationship with her. Meanwhile on the road how eventful can a simple drive of less than 200 miles be?With John Cleese playing the sort of character he is well known for you pretty much know what you're going to get here in this precursor to Planes, Trains & Automobiles. The narrative arch sees us establishing the strictly organised Stimpson before then spending the rest of the film gradually putting him through increasingly comic blunders and delays as he tries to get to his destination on time. It is nothing that special or clever and the events are never that unexpected or imaginative. Personally I rarely laughed out loud but was reasonably amused by it throughout. Morahan's direction is pretty by-the-numbers and his touch is too obvious to be of much help.Cleese is the whole show and it is down to his playing that the film is worth even looking at. Sure his performance is not a million miles from characters he has played before but he is still good. His timing and awareness of his own absurdity helps the material. The rest fall in behind him but mostly the film is all about him and he is rarely offscreen. Overall then an average comedy that is more or less what you expect but should do enough to amuse if not have you roaring with laughter. Cleese makes it worth the while so, if you like him you'll be OK but if not this isn't worth bothering with.

In fact, you don't actually see a lot of him throughout this movie. The film was borne out of an idea that Wes Craven had after he heard some disturbing news article about a number of Japanese students (I believe) who had all died in their sleep. It also goes back to the old tale of the man dreaming that he was being sent to the guillotine, being tapped on the neck by someone and dying instantly. The flaw there, of course, is that if he died instantly then nobody would know what he was dreaming about.Anyway, back to the plot. Burnt, and dead, child molester Freddy Krueger returns to pick off the children on Elm Street, all of them being somehow related to the vigilante group who set fire to him and killed him DEAD. How does he get the kids ? In their dreams. He attacks them while they sleep and if he gets you then you die. That's it. It's a great concept and Craven works well with it.BUT the movie has two major flaws.. Craven's penchant for booby traps which provides us with a finale that veers from the suspenseful to the laughable. The other is Heather put me in a paper bag and I'd be trapped by my limited acting skills Langenkamp. Lots of genre fans love her, I am not one of them. Luckily, her acting is compensated slightly by a good turn from Johnny Depp and a great role for the ever-dependable John Saxon (now THERE'S a genre star). Even the girl that plays Tina does really well with her limited screen time. Throw in a fun, small role for Lin Shaye (known to many as that old crazy woman from There's Something About Mary but she's been a great genre star, appearing in the likes of Critters, 2001 Maniacs and Dead End) and you have a good time for horror lovers.For giving birth to a new slasher icon and franchise and for having many great moments, despite it's flaws, it deserves it's rating.

A friend of mine wrote this film, before his death. Based on a comic book following. I think, even with the regular mode of acting that Mr. Van Damme has, this was on the level as well as an over the edge thriller! The story I loved, with the turn in plot etc, etc, but I found this as many times as I have seen it is still a movie that can glue me to my seat. It is always a wild ride, with one Hell of a punch! I like the fact that our hero loves his wife and family, (in the end with the family). He is a solid character to lean on. He is honest and true to his work and dealing with the criminal element. This was and still is a hard driving story, that's why it was in 1994, Number One at the Box Office. Again however, Peter Hyams, the director and visionary-creative force, has a way with his characters, in shooting scenes, the way the light is brought about from the foreground and the back drop and everything in between. I passed on a chance to meet Mr.Hyams, at a friends house, in Summerland Ca, back in 1994. What an idiot I was! I don't believe too much time goes by that I don't want to kick myself in my own ass for passing up the chance to meet a master craftsman, in the arena of Hollywood film. This action drama doesn't let down! It is a knock-down drag-out festival of action maneuvering and intellectual willing against a stronger more powerful force than himself(Max). I fully enjoyed Bruce McGill as commander Matuzak, the lead guy in charge. I thought that was a different pick then I would have cast in the beginning, but he was actually better than I imagined! He seems to have an air of craziness, and civility together that works out in the part that he is playing. Max Walker, (Van Damme) was a likable guy I think and that's what gives the film more appeal to the masses. He is someone you want to root for, again and again.I recommend this thriller action drama, for action and good twisted plot- lovers.(****) ","genre":null},{"date":"11 December 2006","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Simply put, I dig this cop.

Why did Joe stick around for so long ? He was a shallow guy, he wanted the meal ticket that he was being offered and, yes, despite his disgust at the offerings he always ended up taking them. Why did he end up back with Norma on that fateful night after her suicide attempt ? Because he was too scared, he didn't want to feel responsible for anyone else's pain. If he'd never actually heard of Norma's fate then he would have been long gone but once it was relayed to him, and still with the fresh memory of the part he played, then he had to make sure that he hadn't done any long-term damage. Joe enjoyed making a buck but he wasn't a completely uncaring man.As for Norma Desmond herself, she may well be the single greatest human character ever to be thrown onto celluloid. Half Quasimodo, half Bride Of Frankenstein and . . . . . . ummmm . . . . half Dracula's Daughter. Gloria Swanson bravely plays the faded movie star with a perfect mix of sadness, fiery anger, intense narcissism and pride, all mixed up with some mild overacting and permanent melodrama.William Holden is the coolest narrator ever and his character, although often unlikeable, just about keeps us onside for the duration of the movie. Even if writer\/director Billy Wilder doesn't manage to keep our sympathies with the right character for most of the movie he produces some scenes in the second half that give Holden's character a twisted redemption and reason to finally make a completely clean breast of things.Max, the butler, IS the avid fan taken to the extreme. Devoted, adoring, ever-present, he's the perfect audience member and just what Norma Desmond needs to keep her sanity for as long as she does. Does he actually help her or is he ultimately responsible for her fall over the edge ? Max or Joe, who is the bigger culprit ? An interesting question that I'm not sure I could easily answer.Of course, many other people also help to keep Norma from the truth. Cecil B DeMille, her card-playing buddies, even security guards still working at the studio. If more people had reacted the same way as Joe did initially (dismissing Norma and prompting her reply of I AM big, it's the pictures that got small) then maybe she would have eased back down to earth. If her ego and vanity would have EVER allowed it.The only real innocent character in the movie, the only one who doesn't help to perpetuate any fantasy and who doesn't act for purely personal gain, is Betty Schaffer. It is poor Betty who is quickly drawn in, chewed up and spat out by Holden's character (hmmmm . . . a writer responsible for breaking the heart of a young, up and coming lady . . . . surely not).I love this movie with all my being. I love the faded, preserved shrine that is Norma Desmond's house. The car and the swimming pool being returned to working order, just as Norma herself is, for the benefit of Joe. Are we watching Gloria Swanson playing Norma Desmond throughout this film or are we watching an older actress play every idol that we've ever discarded ? Is the movie disturbing because of the interplay of the characters or because we, as an audience, do not want to venture into this world of forgotten stars and empty theatres ?

Its style and its content are both top notch.A Warning I watched this film for the first time in broad daylight with a group of friends in college. The mood (among those who viewed the film) was upbeat at the beginning. Having heard a lot about the film before we watched it, we all thought we were prepared for what we were about to experience. I will only say that after the credits rolled (and I sat in silence with 8 or 10 of my friends for probably 5 minutes) I promptly stood up and walked out the door without a word and went home.Part of the reason I was personally affected by the film was that I had a very strong empathy where Ms. Burstyn's character was concerned. She reminded me intensely of my own mother. Watching her transformation was incredibly difficult. It is usually assumed that drugs were the cause of each of the 4 characters' downfalls. Contrary to this opinion, I found that Mrs. Goldfarb's particular descent was caused instead by loneliness. Her son's willful neglect for her (epitomized in the scene that finds him crying in a cab after his visit) brought the elder Goldfarb to a state of mind in which the adoring attention of a television audience was her ultimate goal. She needed approval from somewhere.The darkness that slowly envelopes each character creeps into the viewers subconscious throughout the film. The knowledge that things are turning bad slips slowly into the film until, finally, it's too late. Rarely has a film ever brought this bleakness so clearly into focus for me.

I wanted to be repulsed, instead I was sympathetic.Although you will find people who have seen this movie and do not really 'feel' it the way I did, it's been my experience that most are truly moved (but usually not in a positive way).

I will only say that after the credits rolled (and I sat in silence with 8 or 10 of my friends for probably 5 minutes) I promptly stood up and walked out the door without a word and went home.Part of the reason I was personally affected by the film was that I had a very strong empathy where Ms. Burstyn's character was concerned. She reminded me intensely of my own mother. Watching her transformation was incredibly difficult. It is usually assumed that drugs were the cause of each of the 4 characters' downfalls. Contrary to this opinion, I found that Mrs. Goldfarb's particular descent was caused instead by loneliness. Her son's willful neglect for her (epitomized in the scene that finds him crying in a cab after his visit) brought the elder Goldfarb to a state of mind in which the adoring attention of a television audience was her ultimate goal. She needed approval from somewhere.The darkness that slowly envelopes each character creeps into the viewers subconscious throughout the film. The knowledge that things are turning bad slips slowly into the film until, finally, it's too late. Rarely has a film ever brought this bleakness so clearly into focus for me. I was ashamed of myself, as ridiculous as that sounds.The most powerful scene of the film was, for me, the last encounter with Jennifer Connelly's character. Curled up on her couch with the spoils of the previous night's 'efforts', she smiles like a child being held by her mother. I wanted to be repulsed, instead I was sympathetic.Although you will find people who have seen this movie and do not really 'feel' it the way I did, it's been my experience that most are truly moved (but usually not in a positive way). You WILL feel empty. You WILL fell dejected, but most of all you will be glad you watched it.

I first saw Bottle Rocket while in high school and talked about it for an entire year. I thought it was one of the funniest things I'd ever seen, then we were given Rushmore, which was another gift from Anderson, and finally we get The Royal Tenenbaums, which is the culmination of an incredible collaboration with his writing partner Owen Wilson and his cinematographer Robert Yeomen. I read a comment about this movie earlier that calls all the characters stereotypes, and I couldn't disagree more. I've never come across characters quite like this and I'd like anyone to disagree with me by pointing out examples of other characters that are so beautiful and comically flawed. I cared for each of the characters, I was rooting for Royal and I did laugh my ass off. I watch this movie often now, it's on my list of my top films. If you want something very unique, something is a great soundtrack, incredible acting, near flawless directing and writing, then you MUST see this movie. This isn't the comedy that is for everyone, mind you. This isn't some Cameron Diaz or Reese Witherspoon hand-feed you comedy using all the cliché conventions to rile a laugh out of you. It isn't slapstick, it isn't forced joke set-ups and pay-offs. This is intelligent, complex writing of situational humor motivated by very strong characters. If you want something that is not the conventional old comedy, then this is perfect.

The chemistry among the three main characters is what makes this movie so great, from the love-hate relationship between Crash and Nuke, to the sexual tension felt throughout the entire film between Crash and Annie.
