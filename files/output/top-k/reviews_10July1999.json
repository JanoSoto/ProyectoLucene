If you thought they had pushed some buttons in the TV series, in here they start the next world war, quite literally . Crude, vulgar, sexist, racist, homophobic, xenophobic, all in the name of some good political incorrectness. But don't worry there's some social comments about our state of morality for us who like our humor raunchy but deep. What amazes me even more is the accuracy with which Stone and Parker satirize American vices. I laughed my butt off at a part when a man steps out of a movie in the picture sayin' What did you expect? They're canadians. I heard a man in front of me sayin' this same thing and leavin' the theater when I went to see eXistenZ (a recent movie by talented Canadian film maker David Cronenberg).Talk about life imitating art!!!!! I even envy Canadians a little bit, 'cause they'll be having an intellectual high with this film. There's some wicked references to some films like Clockwork Orange, Patton and Akira, so go and find them. Also, the musical numbers were great, mocking everything from Disney musicals to Les Miserables. This movie is really one of the greatest mixtures of high art and low humour I've seen in a very, very long time.

It cut out many important scenes from the novel and didn't do a very good job of familiarizing the audience with its characters. In fact, I found myself often confused at who was who, but since the movie centered around the important characters anyways, it was easily overlooked. I was looking forward to seeing more of Ayla practicing her medicine, or of her relationship with Creb and all the others in the Clan--these were events significant in the book yet lacking in the film. I was disappointed with many things in this movie, but I must admit there was also a lot to admire. I especially like the actors who were casted...Emma Floria made an adorable baby Ayla! I also liked Nicole Eggert as Middle Ayla and can see her everytime I read Clan of The Cave Bear. Daryl Hannah totally *becomes* Ayla in the film. I loved her performance in this movie--her spirit, that look of defiance in her eyes that makes her so believable as the Woman Who Hunts. Pamela Reed and James Remar were excellent as Iza and Creb, John Doolittle embodied Brun's character, and Thomas G. Waites was amazing as Broud. Other things to compliment on are the upbeat music score and film location. I also liked the make-up and costumes. All in all, I enjoyed this movie. It had a solid plot, but would have been much better if it stuck with the original storyline.

And I think I know why films now a days can't hold a candle to films like Halloween and Evil Dead.  And that is because a photo copy is never as good as the original.  That is the bottom line.  Directors don't care about a lot of the material that they are filming today, especially when it comes to horror films and that is because they don't write their own stories.  They do someone elses work.  But not Evil Dead.  This was Raimi's baby from the outset.  When films like the two mentioned were filmed they were filmed by two directors that were complete unknowns.  They had no pressure to make a great film and they did it on an incredibly low budget.  Halloween was made for $150,000 and Evil Dead for $50 000.  So what that meant is that the directors could stick to their visions but they had to find innovative ways to do so.  Their budgets didn't allow a heap of special effects so they had to rely on what they knew.  And that was, how to create atmosphere using the camera.  And Evil Dead is one of the best at doing that.  There is one scene in this film that I will never forget and that is one of the early scenes where the cast arrives at the cabin.  Here we see a long shot of the cabin and it has very eerie music playing.  This shows the cabin as being menacing.  It lets you know that there is evil in that cabin.  And that we are in for a hell of a ride.Sam Raimi made a masterpiece here that I believe stands the test of time. You can put this film up against any of today's so called horror films and I guarantee you this scares you more.  Raimi cares about his movie and he does everything to make you feel the terror that the cabin people feel.  We are scared and disgusted at what happens when one of the women goes outside alone at night and meets a tree that does unspeakable things.  And when the book is first introduced.... that is horror movie history there.  What a brilliant concept.  A book that is evil.  I have often wondered about such books.  We hear about them all the time in movies about ancient Egypt and ancient times.  But here we have a book that has weird incantations from another world and another language, and you just know that as soon as some idiot utters the words that they are not supposed to say, well they won't be around much longer.The Evil Dead is a miracle.  It was made on a rock bottom budget yet it is scarier than any Hollywood movie that is made for 20 million could ever hope to be.  If you want to truly experience a frightening experience, rent this film, it knows what it wants to say.  And it knows how to make you afraid. So be afraid.  Be very afraid.

It's bad enough seeing Jennifer Lopez and Eric Stoltz sink to such depths (where Kari Wurher and Ice Cube apparently belong), but Jon Voight manages to thoroughly embarrass himself moost of all with all the grace and charm of a dead walrus.  His thick, cheesy, Speedy Gonzalez accent, and over-the-top performance, won howls of derision from the whole herd in the theater.

Having been an English Specialist in University, it was refreshing to see such a faithful adaptation of the Bard's work on the screen.    Originally I had avoided seeing the film because I considered it just another of those pappy films put out by Hollywood to snag the teenaged market, however, it pleasantly surprised me. The acting is top notch, especially the performances turned in by Julia Stiles and Heath Ledger as the leads, and Larry Miller as Katerina Stratford's father. The nods to Shakespeare are everywhere, in the name of the high school where the majority of the action takes place (Padua High) to the names of the characters (Katerina Stratford, Patrick Verona).  This film is simply an updating of the play, and it is remarkably well done.  Less well done, however, is She's All That, the recent update of Pygmalion. If you have the chance, catch this film at any second-run theatre, you will greatly enjoy it! ","genre":null},{"date":"10 July 1999","score":"","review":"  This film was a major surprise to me.

We both were so upset by the movie that I felt that I needed to communicate our feelings.We are frequent movie goers who are in our mid fifties.  We certainly are not prudes when it comes to our selection of entertainment.  We almost always pick an action or drama film and are used to not always coming away from a film feeling good.However, this movie today was very disturbing to us.  In light of the problems with real life violence these days , we certainly did not need to watch what happened in this film.  I realize that we could have walked out when we felt uncomfortable, but as I said, we like action and drama.   The way the film ended was what truly disturbed us.  The fact that the bad guys won and the truth was not told was tragic way to leave the film.We saw this movie as encouragement for all of those nuts out there watching it.  They could see this and feel that they could also get away with such an evil deed.  We are very disappointed that Jeff Bridges would have performed in a movie with such an outcome.I am sure that there were many other people in the theater who felt the same way that we do but would not take the time to voice their opinions.I am sure that my writing this letter will have absolutely no effect on what is chosen for the big screen but I sure feel better for writing it!Nancy Marschak Santa Barbara, CA  ","genre":null},{"date":"10 July 1999","score":"7 out of 11 people found the following review useful","review":"  My husband and I have just returned home from seeing Arlington Road.
