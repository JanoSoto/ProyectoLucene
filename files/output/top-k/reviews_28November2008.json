From a modern perspective, it's a bit weird and even schlocky, and it hardly ever makes sense. At the time however, it was a valiant attempt to get harsh issues such as homosexuality, infidelity and alcoholism past the censors it was an eye-opener of a movie.We get to follow a pivotal day in the life of a wealthy Southron family. Maggie (Elizabeth Taylor) and Brick (Paul Newman) are outwardly the American dream couple, but it soon comes out that he's an alcoholic who refuses to have sex with his wife, whom he suspects of having driven his best mate (and possibly, homosexual lover) to suicide. At the same time the patriarch of the house, Big Daddy, returns from a medical examination, in which he was told that he was sound as a dollar although he was actually diagnosed with terminal cancer, and Brick's older brother Gooper is vying for the attentions of his cold-hearted father.Yep, it's a pretty heady, histrionic stew, the entire season of a soap opera rolled into one. This movie is aimed very squarely at its 1958 audience, which it challenged with a whole raft of unheard-of subjects. And although it plays strictly by the Hays Code (everyone keeps their clothes on and all oaths are minced) it remains shocking until this day. Maggie (Taylor) is one of the most sexually charged women I have ever come across -- she is plain horny, and wielding her sexuality as her one and only weapon. I have never seen anything like her in any other movie. At the same time even she is outdone by her mother-in-law, who blatantly accuses her of not doing enough in the sack to satisfy her son.The movie continues along those lines. It is crass in a good way. The plot itself is somewhat secondary, and it ends with Brick and Maggie spontaneously making up and everyone becoming a happy family again. This makes no sense, it actually just serves to wrap up the movie.I really enjoyed the kids, by the way, they are real brats and a breath of fresh air in the stench of that old mansion.Also, it has to be said that Burl Ives in the role of Big Daddy is out of this world. His role is pivotal, because Big Daddy is essentially a monster. But Ives makes the old, dying, misanthropic patriarch look like an apple-scrumping schoolboy at some moments, and therefore keeps the entire plot together. You have to see the movie just for Ives (OK, and for Liz Taylor looking somewhat lither than she does today).If you have an interest in cinema and history, and are therefore capable of placing this movie in its context, you're in for one helluva ride. But if you're just looking for a good flick to unwind to, it has to be said honestly that Cat On A Hot Tin Roof won't be your best choice. It's one of those movies which takes energy to watch.

It can so easily get boring, seeing one guy trying to cope with the vicissitudes of a majestic but harsh and unforgiving environment, and occasional brief encounters with other humans, half of them determined to kill him. (All but two of the other half are indifferent.) I couldn't do it.A story like this can so easily go wrong, as it did in Castaway, for instance. But with the help of the extraordinarily popular and handsome Robert Redford, the movie makers manage to pull it off. There's hardly a dull moment.Nothing comes off quite as expected. At first, Redford knows nothing about survival in the wilderness. Finally he is taken in for a short spell by an old grizzly hunter, Will Geer, from whom he learns the rudiments of getting along from one day to the next.The movie of course depends on Redford. Despite his personal attraction to the mountains of Utah, it seems like a poor choice because he's a minimalist actor, releasing whole gigabytes of information with a roll of his eyes. And the director, Sidney Pollack, a master of urban Angst, expects us to become involved with this guy? But Redford's cool actually makes the film more interesting in that, through his very reticence, he introduces an element of simultaneous contrast with the events going on around him. He proves to be a good physical actor, but he's almost a hole in the story, being to the movie as a whole, what the pupil is to an attractive eyeball.Redford is no hero here, mostly just an ordinary neurotic who's trying to forget the (Mexican-American) war. Most of the time his handsome features are hidden by a full beard. There are only two expectable genre conventions. One is that he keeps killing Crow Indians as they attack him one by one and, though often wounded, he's always the victor. The second is that he mistakenly enters into a marriage with a Flathead (or Salish) woman and is forced by circumstance to adopt a mute white boy. There is the simulacrum of a family then. After they get to know one another a bit, they play field hockey together. (Ho hum, says the savvy viewer.) But they're lost to him because he chooses to aid some stranded white folks, so he's left on his own again. The ending is ambiguous. It's not clear how Redford turns out. If he survives the continuous Crow attacks, he might well end up as savage and bitter as the animals he kills. A different, and equally realistic description of the life of a trapper, can be found in A. B. Guthrie's The Big Sky -- the novel, not the movie. There's a surprising amount of humor. Well -- ANY humor in the story of a man traipsing by himself through the wilderness is liable to be surprising. But, really, running across a guy buried to his neck in the soil? Claiming he is still sitting on his buried horse? Pollack, thank God, doesn't really go in for the easy shots. Aside from hiding Redford's features, the director manages to avoid having him strip off his shirt to take a swim. (Imagine Sylvester Stallone in the part.) Redford and his non-English-speaking wife have a friendly but sharp exchange, like the Flintstones. After lengthy periods of isolation, when a friend shows up in the distance, they don't greet each other warmly. They don't greet each other at all. Neither do they say good-bye. When they decide to split up, one says, I think I'll go to Canada. The other says, Keep your hair, and rides off shouting gibberish to himself. The Indians are treated fairly. After Redford has just slaughtered four or five of the Crow who have murdered his family, he corners the last one, who begins singing his death song. Redford crouches over him with his knife, eyes darting around, then shuffles off without killing him. There are some fights but they're realistic -- mano a mano, and short. Nobody dangles from a cliff, let alone from a skyscraper. We don't see two bodies struggling under the water. None of the violence is in fashionable slow motion.

Schaffner, who did many Studio Ones and much later was the director of Patton. I can now compare it to the famous movie version, starring Henry Fonda, which was directled by Sidney Lumet three years later. A lot of the things Lumet gets credited for in some of these reviews are already present in Schaffner's staging, including starting with the high camera angle and ending with the close-ups.A key difference is that the TV version is only an hour long, (actually only 50 minutes due to commercials), while the film uses 96 minutes to tell its story. Some of the lesser characters suffer as a result. In the film Robert Webber's nice-guy businessman wants so much to go along with anybody else that he changes his vote simply to be part of the majority when the tide turns. In the Teleplay, we never learn why Will West changes his mind. Edward Binns as juror #6, is very protective of the old man, Juror #9, (played by Joseph Sweeney in both versions), in the movie. He clearly sees him as a similar to his own elderly but beloved father. In the teleplay, Bart Burns is little more than a spectator, except for one key moment that has nothing to do with the old man.But the big difference is in the lead actor, Robert Cummings, (He was Bob in a comedy, Robert in a drama), vs. Henry Fonda in the film. Fonda is, of course, an actor of much greater repute but Cummings was much underrated. He was a thoughtful actor in dramas, carefully weighing his words and inviting the audience to think along with him. As Juror#8, Cummings portrays a man who is not sure of himself as the beginning but wants to answer some key questions before he makes a decision. In the film, Fonda seems like a man who has already decided to vote not guilty from the beginning and is trying to figure out how to loosen up his fellow jurors from their stances so he can draw them over to his view of things. A key point is that fact that the lady who saw the murder through the windows of the train wore glasses. In the film, Fonda divines this by noting how E.G. Marshall, as juror #4 rubs his nose to deal with the irritation the glasses cause. It's the final piece to the mosaic Fonda is trying to create. In the teleplay, it is Burns' juror #6 who makes this point after watching juror #2 and this seems to be the final piece of the puzzle for Cummings who for the first time, has become firm in his decision to vote not guilty.His two antagonists are jurors #3 and #10. #10 is Edward Arnold in the teleplay, Ed Begley in the film. Both are good. The scene where #10 is ranting on about people like that is more effective in the film. It's just a matter of timing. On TV, the jurors get up and begin to walk away as soon as he starts talking. In the movie they do so more slowly, each one making the decision on his own. Franchot Tone, another underrated actor, (he started out playing charming men about town and wound up playing garrulous old timers), is just as strong and forceful as Lee J. Cobb. His true motivation, his resentment of his own son, is hinted at early but is not part of his breakdown at the end. In fact, he doesn't break down at all. He simply surrenders. He doesn't become Cobb's shell of a man.As to the other jurors, Martin Balsam has more to do than Norman Fell as juror #1, the foreman. Martin's a nice guy who just wants everybody to get along. We don't' know that much about Norman. John Beal's role as juror #2 just calls for him to use his watch to time Cummings' performance as the old man walking and to wipe his glasses clean at the right time. Marshall came through a little stronger than Walter Abel as a relentless logic machine who can't think outside the box. Lee Phillips is solid as the shy young man, somewhat ashamed of coming from a disadvantaged background. Burns has little to do besides noting the significance of Beal's glasses. Paul Hartman is OK as the guy who wants to leave early, (he has tickets to the theater, not a ballgame). Much of the additional dialog in the movie goes to Jack Warden's version of this character. Sweeney and George Voskovic are the only two actors in both versions and both are fine, with Voskovic underlining the significance of this procedure to someone who came here to experience freedom. Missing though, is his empathy for the defendant as an outsider like him, which is emphasized in the film. West, as indicated, is a non-entity in the teleplay.On the whole, I'll take the movie over the TV original but it's a close thing. But the TV version, which was missing for many years, is certainly worth seeing.

But the TV version, which was missing for many years, is certainly worth seeing. ","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"28 November 2008","score":"","review":" The Archive of American Television has finally come out with a DVD version of the original Studio One teleplay, 12 Angry Men by Reginald Rose, directed by Franklyn J. Schaffner, who did many Studio Ones and much later was the director of Patton. I can now compare it to the famous movie version, starring Henry Fonda, which was directled by Sidney Lumet three years later. A lot of the things Lumet gets credited for in some of these reviews are already present in Schaffner's staging, including starting with the high camera angle and ending with the close-ups.A key difference is that the TV version is only an hour long, (actually only 50 minutes due to commercials), while the film uses 96 minutes to tell its story. Some of the lesser characters suffer as a result. In the film Robert Webber's nice-guy businessman wants so much to go along with anybody else that he changes his vote simply to be part of the majority when the tide turns. In the Teleplay, we never learn why Will West changes his mind. Edward Binns as juror #6, is very protective of the old man, Juror #9, (played by Joseph Sweeney in both versions), in the movie. He clearly sees him as a similar to his own elderly but beloved father. In the teleplay, Bart Burns is little more than a spectator, except for one key moment that has nothing to do with the old man.But the big difference is in the lead actor, Robert Cummings, (He was Bob in a comedy, Robert in a drama), vs. Henry Fonda in the film. Fonda is, of course, an actor of much greater repute but Cummings was much underrated. He was a thoughtful actor in dramas, carefully weighing his words and inviting the audience to think along with him. As Juror#8, Cummings portrays a man who is not sure of himself as the beginning but wants to answer some key questions before he makes a decision. In the film, Fonda seems like a man who has already decided to vote not guilty from the beginning and is trying to figure out how to loosen up his fellow jurors from their stances so he can draw them over to his view of things. A key point is that fact that the lady who saw the murder through the windows of the train wore glasses. In the film, Fonda divines this by noting how E.G. Marshall, as juror #4 rubs his nose to deal with the irritation the glasses cause. It's the final piece to the mosaic Fonda is trying to create. In the teleplay, it is Burns' juror #6 who makes this point after watching juror #2 and this seems to be the final piece of the puzzle for Cummings who for the first time, has become firm in his decision to vote not guilty.His two antagonists are jurors #3 and #10. #10 is Edward Arnold in the teleplay, Ed Begley in the film. Both are good. The scene where #10 is ranting on about people like that is more effective in the film. It's just a matter of timing. On TV, the jurors get up and begin to walk away as soon as he starts talking. In the movie they do so more slowly, each one making the decision on his own. Franchot Tone, another underrated actor, (he started out playing charming men about town and wound up playing garrulous old timers), is just as strong and forceful as Lee J. Cobb. His true motivation, his resentment of his own son, is hinted at early but is not part of his breakdown at the end. In fact, he doesn't break down at all. He simply surrenders. He doesn't become Cobb's shell of a man.As to the other jurors, Martin Balsam has more to do than Norman Fell as juror #1, the foreman. Martin's a nice guy who just wants everybody to get along. We don't' know that much about Norman. John Beal's role as juror #2 just calls for him to use his watch to time Cummings' performance as the old man walking and to wipe his glasses clean at the right time. Marshall came through a little stronger than Walter Abel as a relentless logic machine who can't think outside the box. Lee Phillips is solid as the shy young man, somewhat ashamed of coming from a disadvantaged background. Burns has little to do besides noting the significance of Beal's glasses.

Yet it makes for one of the more entertaining thrill rides among 1960s' World War II films.Sinatra is Col. Joseph Ryan, a fighter pilot shot down in Italy just days after the liberation of Sicily. He is taken to an Italian POW camp, mostly occupied by British soldiers under the command of Major Fincham, played by Trevor Howard as a martinet overcommitted to the idea of escape at all costs. Ryan would rather cool it and wait for Allied liberation, but then the Germans get involved. Desperate measures are called for.This is all established in the first 30 minutes of Von Ryan's Express, which poses an interesting challenge to the mindset of films like Great Escape What's the point in a jailbreak if you wind up losing most of your men?An exchange between Ryan and Fincham captures this well. OK, clue me, asks Ryan, a tad anachronistically. Suppose you do rig an escape. How many men do you figure to get clear?If one gets out, it's a victory, Fincham replies.Sure it is, Ryan mutters.Actually, Fincham's words inspire another kind of boldness in Ryan, a kind that gets sorely needed medicine to suffering prisoners and earns Ryan the nickname Von Ryan, as in collaborator. Sinatra's performance may feel a bit like he should be wearing a sharkskin flight suit, but he and the script do a good job of setting up Ryan's loner character, and developing a kind of tension that the latter part of the film, a more straightforward war adventure, churns through nicely.There's palpable energy boiling between Sinatra and Howard, the latter revisiting his Capt. Bligh performance from Mutiny On The Bounty three years before but in a somewhat mellower vein. His Fincham is a remarkable whiner, given to exclaiming We've had it at every bad turn, but the film doesn't make Ryan the sole font of wisdom. For one thing, he doesn't know the science of killing a guard from behind, which Fincham explains with juicy relish.It can even be argued that the characters would have been better off with Fincham calling the shots all the way, though they would have been a lot less easy to root for, Allies or no. Ryan's not as war-embittered as Fincham, he's a 90-day wonder as he puts it, and though crafty, his humanistic instincts don't necessarily make him the better man.Nothing really sticks out as brilliant or clever in Von Ryan's Express, and indeed there are plenty of sizeable plot holes along the way, but it's a good film with decent supporting performances and some nice set design and Alpine scenics, like Raffaella Carra in a plunging negligee. Director Mark Robson knows what he has in his hands, an Alistair MacLean-type story, and doesn't overcomplicate things with a lot of character exposition. The best sequence features Edward Mulhare as a German-speaking British padre who must help his comrades sneak past a guarded railroad. Sinatra shines especially in a scene where a Gestapo agent takes an interest in his watch.The most memorable thing about Von Ryan's Express is its tough, taut conclusion, probably why it's as highly regarded as it is today.

He also frequently proposed that there can be no single, objective plane of reality; our perception of time and existence is inescapably influenced by the meagre subjective workings of our brains. Dick's musings on reality and awareness, largely influenced by his experimentation with mind-altering narcotics, were ahead of their time in science-fiction literature, and it's no surprise that adaptations of his works comprise some of the genre's finest cinematic entries &#150; including Scott's 'Blade Runner (1982),' Verhoeven's 'Total Recall (1990)' and Spielberg's 'Minority Report (2002).' Originally published in 1956, The Minority Report is not one of Dick's richest short stories, really serving only to introduce the basic concept of precognition, and to briefly explore the relevant themes inherent in its mechanics; namely, free will vs. determinism. Out of this fascinating framework, however, Steven Spielberg has crafted one of the most breathtakingly comprehensive futuristic visions ever committed to the screen.I've always loved time-travel movies, mostly because they explore the intriguing notions of causality, determinism and fatalism. Though 'Minority Report' doesn't strictly qualify (since it's only information making the journey), it nonetheless grapples with similar metaphysical ideas, paradoxes and moral dilemmas. Can the Precogs truly be foreseeing the future if their visions result in the prevention of those future events? Is it ethical to punish citizens who have committed no crime, but may conceivably have done so in an alternate timeline? John Anderton (Tom Cruise) believes unwaveringly in the merits of Pre-Crime, having lost his son in an unsolved kidnapping six years earlier, and being determined never to allow another such an atrocity to take place. However, his implicit trust in this perfect system is suddenly shattered when he, Anderton, is accused of the future murder of a man he's never met. Convinced that he is being framed by an ambitious federal representative (Colin Farrell), Anderton goes on the lam, and, to prove his innocence, must elude and defeat the system he helped create.This man on the run framework supplies the blueprints for a series of heart-stopping action and suspense sequences, with Spielberg exploiting possible future technology (such as self-driving cars, police jet-packs, and spyder surveillance gadgets) for maximum thrills. The completeness of his future vision is simply breathtaking, with CGI used extensively but never intrusively. The cinematography of Janusz Kaminski resembles that of his previous Spielberg collaboration, 'AI Artificial Intelligence (2001),' adding to the great tradition of visually-rich science fiction cinema. Washington D.C. in 2054 possesses elements of both a utopian and dystopian future. In the city's more respectable districts, where businessmen and politicians debate the future of Pre-Crime, the rooms are awash with light, deliberately over-lit and with extreme colour desaturation, the negative having been bleach-bypassed in post-production. In the city's destitute slums, known as the Sprawl, we witness the decadence of contemporary society, bathed in a shadowy noirish darkness, where blind drug dealers lounge in the shadows and spout wisdom like in the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king.The concept of eyes &#150; our primary means of perceiving the world &#150; is very important to the film. They are continually used to identify us, but this technology can be bypassed through relatively inexpensive underground surgical procedures (performed in a manner that calls to mind the Ludovico technique in Kubrick's 'A Clockwork Orange (1971),' another film that explores the notion of free-will). Just as the eye can fool others, the visuals provided to our own brains have the tendency to mislead. The Precog Agatha (Samantha Morton) frequently uses the phrase Can you see?, in a manner that implies not just optical recognition but an otherwise-elusive greater understanding of human nature. The brightly-lit surroundings of upper-class Washington DC are merely a facade, designed to bolster the mind into a false sense of optimism and security, lest we remove our blindfolds to genuinely appreciate society's darkened heart. The Pre-Crime system may be perfect, contends Danny Witwer, but, if there's a flaw, it's human. In such a way, deliberate misdirection allows elderly director Lamar Burgess (Max Von Sydow) to hoodwink the senses and get away with murder.Steven Spielberg has often been criticised for an overwhelming need to end his films on an upbeat note. It's true that he likes to have his patrons leave the cinema smiling, and, over the years, I suppose that he's developed a rapport with his audience that he's hesitant about breaking; in a way, he's the antithesis of Terry Gilliam, who likes to end his sci-fis by kicking the audience in the guts. However, delve a little deeper into each films' themes, and often the outcome isn't as optimistic as we'd initially thought. The much-disparaged epilogue to 'AI Artificial Intelligence,' carried over from Stanley Kubrick, is much sadder and despairing than we initially believe.

Even though it was not quite as good as the first trilogy, I did believe it received waaay too much criticism. Since a friend of mine who believes Episode 2 is the best, recommended to me this film. I then decided to give it a chance. When I first watched it that long ago, I thought it was . . . OK. Nothing, but OK. Now, when I recently saw it again, I thought it was terrible!! Now that I always give films a closer look as I have a great interest in film-making, I just began to hate it more than I might have otherwise.Episode 3 is probably the best, but this certainly isn't. Ewan McGregor does a decent job at portraying Obi-Wan Kenobi. He is not as good as Alec Guiness, but I give him some credit as he manages to get Alec Guiness' character reasonably accurate. I was disappointed in Natalie Portman and Sam Jackson for wasting their time on this pointless sequel. Hayden Christensen . . . I don't want to mention in him in relation to Star Wars, ever again. I would be surprised if he did not win his razzie award. There are one or two scenes when he shows some decency as Anakin, but other times, it makes my eyes bleed to watch his character. Characters have personalities, you know. He obviously does not know what the word personality means. I wish George Lucas chose a person who did.The screenplay is ridiculous. Add little action, boring sequences, simple story and awful dialogue. There is not a worse mixture of elements to a story. George Lucas may be the brainiac who created Star Wars, but he obviously does not think about how a character's dialogue should sound like. A character! We do not want robots that have same sort of speeches.Special effects and music, I can praise.

The notorious story of conflict between Welles and RKO over this film is very complicated, and one cannot help but wonder in seeing this film. Because as it stands, although it remains a good film, there are some elements that just don't match.To begin with, the ending. It feels entirely unnatural and out of place. This film does not deserve a happy ending, just like Citizen Kane did not deserve one. It's part of the game. In Orson Welles interest, as in Stanley Kubrick's, the main character is almost always the true anti-hero, the one we are not supposed to side with. But all along, we do anyways, because we always hope that something within him will make him change. And yet in The Magnificent Ambersons, unlike Citizen Kane, we know right from the start that Eugene is a terrible person. He's a spoiled child, a liar and a delinquent, who thinks he owns the town because of the second name he carries. In fact, his family doesn't like him either. Then why do we like him? Perhaps we know that he is not half as important as he thinks, because he knows nothing of his family's business, and keeps supporting his theses, possibly biased, that the automobile is a nuisance. He is a loser, one that will certainly not go anywhere, because he doesn't want a career. He is possibly destined to end up badly.What lacks in this story probably ended up in the cutting room floor. The pace of the film is very quickened, and some emotional bits seem to be missing. One important element, is the way we never really see the the loving relationship between George and his mother. This, however, isn't all bad, because the only time we see them alone together is in a brief scene when they decide to leave the town and travel the world. This is a decision that troubles Isabel greatly, but she will part from her lover for his son's sake. The effect this has on the movie is positive, because this is the real chance George has of showing us that he is not evil, and yet, he doesn't take it.The bad situation that the Ambersons are left with is something that should have been studied deeper. And there is no explaining why the film wouldn't end with the image of George praying on his bedside, finally realizing that all the bad he has done has come back to haunt him. That would have been a much better, if much harder, finale. That, is not Welles fault, whether you blame him for the outcome of the film or not. It was the studio that decided, after a few test viewings, that the film's ending left most of the audience dissatisfied, although the same audience was the one that had laughed at lesser and more entertaining movies that didn't go well with an arty movie as The Magnificent Ambersons.The technical side is flawless as usual. In the mansion, Welles is the real Magnificent Amberson, moving the camera about it is a truly spectacular way. When we first enter the mansion in the dance in George's honor in the beginning of the film, we are greeted as guests, and we enter through the door, with a tracking shot that lets us admire the house bit by bit. Of course, Welles' famous deep focus technique adds to the magnificence of the sets, that are enriched. The visuals are truly overwhelming, and the photography is something innovative. The scenes set on the staircase alone are enough to show all of Welles' supremacy on the technical side.As far as the acting is concerned, that is one of the weak points of the film. Although Tim Holt acts in the way Welles did in Citizen Kane as Charles Foster Kane, he has his weak moments, that Welles himself could have turned in better. It is, in fact surprising that Welles would decide not to play the part himself. The similarities between the two characters are great, they even share a common joke about fatness, when Fanny tells George that he'll get fat, and George says that he can't help it because she is such a good cook (in Citizen Kane, Charles Kane is asked rhetorically if he's still eating, and he replies Well, I'm still hungry). Anne Baxter turns in a good performance as his love affair, and the camera really loves her. She looks most gracious in the scene where George tells her that he will be gone forever, and she acts like she doesn't care. You just want to jump in the screen and squeeze her tight, because you know it's a cover up, and in fact, just as George turns, she breaks down. It is in fact one of the most interesting aspects of the movie, the relationship between the two of them. You ultimately do wonder how she can love such a spoiled child in his mid-twenties. You wonder how can a man as arrogant as him make her happy. Perhaps she loves him because she knows he is a good man, just like we hope that he is.As is stands today, The Magnificent Ambersons is mostly acknowledged because of all the problems and rumors that concerned the production. This film, however, remains a very good film, and it should be remembered, watched, and admired as one of Orson Welles' greatest works. He gets the first and last words in the movie, although he did not get the last say.WATCH FOR THE MOMENT - There are many moments within the film, but the one that really got to me were the credits, that are announced by Orson Welles, in the way he did in his radio shows. Priceless, just priceless.

Like A Clockwork Orange that would make him famous, this involves his character's misadventures with his partners in crime in which the coldness, cruelty, and perversion of this peculiarly British institution is resisted.I enjoyed the film although it feels a bit like a guilty pleasure. I am not sure whose side I am on with this one. Perhaps that is the greatness inherent in this film, that one sympathizes and at the same time is horrified by the antics of these young men. Being a teacher in an American high school, I suspect that the collective education of young people requires a lot of control and supervision. On the other hand it seems inevitable that this control takes on the nature of prisons and lunatic asylums. And as with prisons and lunatic asylums, not all the lunatics and criminals are on the inside looking out.As with A Clockwork Orange it is a black comedy that says as much about the individual as with the society in which he lives. As the film progresses the world of the students passes farther and farther into surrealism. The final interview with the dean is weirdly accurate in its portrayal of school administrators, and the Alice in Wonderland quality of that interview is brilliantly demonstrated by the Chaplain who emerges from a drawer to shake hands and accept an apology. The mild punishment imposed by the Dean in the next to last misadventure, as well as the brutality of the cold showers and corporal punishments of the previous episodes were both wrong.The Columbine High School-like episode at the end of the film was both prescient and seemed like a bit of fictional desperation.

Is it some kind of hope... or simply &#150; life and all that life represents? Is life bigger than everything, and is the human being bigger than the whole cosmos?

Is it everything there is, the axiomatic state?Why do I always have to wait for the end, for only a few seconds experiencing immortality? And the feeling, that after death wins the battle, it is life that stays, or outbreaks? (Socrat said that life springs from the death.) Does that mean that one should die to become immortal? The whole galaxy and records of time narrow down to a tiny little fetus (no, it's not a baby)... completely motionless, eyes wide open (!), frozen in timeless, space-less... The Fetus Strikes Back! OK, that is more than profound, it is... well, the image of the fetus is HERE, in my mind, doesn't go away, and never will! The fetus is the ultimate destination! The fetus is GOD!But why would all those aliens, angels, machines, life (?) forms... bring us back to the beginning of the completely SAME STATE OF EXISTENCE (more or less)?

I'll get my own little bigger-than-life fetus once... and I advise that to everyone else!But since I am female, and this interpretation of that archaic image could be due to that (the maternal instincts & sh*t), that might not have been the point Kubrick wanted to make (men probably interpret the fetus as themselves, which was my case as well, when I was 7, that is). It is supposed to be the offspring of a new, improved human race? Now, we all know that men are physically stronger, even through history, the majority of geniuses were male, blah blah...

Dave succeeded to perforate the orbit of humanity and reach Jupiter. Dave is a superman! No, Dave is NOT a superman! He is not even a man! Dave seems to be the least human, even less than HAL. Dave reached those superior beings, to change the course of humanity, as the best genetic material on this earth, and once again, the changing of a course occurs, as in the dawn of man.

I'll get my own little bigger-than-life fetus once... and I advise that to everyone else!But since I am female, and this interpretation of that archaic image could be due to that (the maternal instincts & sh*t), that might not have been the point Kubrick wanted to make (men probably interpret the fetus as themselves, which was my case as well, when I was 7, that is). It is supposed to be the offspring of a new, improved human race? Now, we all know that men are physically stronger, even through history, the majority of geniuses were male, blah blah... And Dave... is a perfect one. Only astronauts can be that healthy, strong, beautiful, intelligent, self-controlled &#150; even to the extent to be able to conquer HAL's HUMAN impulses?! Dave succeeded to perforate the orbit of humanity and reach Jupiter. Dave is a superman! No, Dave is NOT a superman! He is not even a man! Dave seems to be the least human, even less than HAL. Dave reached those superior beings, to change the course of humanity, as the best genetic material on this earth, and once again, the changing of a course occurs, as in the dawn of man. And there lies a hope. That's nice of him.But wait, where is female in all that? Do aliens have a constructed womb? Because that symbol, in this case, would be the whole universe. I only got to see some kind of aura around the embryo. Does the fetus have a penis? I guess not, it doesn't need one. For it doesn't need female, that non-perfect creature. Everyone seems to be male in this movie, even HAL! Are they gay or what?Freud would probably disagree and laugh at the idea of someone surpassing those disgraceful, degrading instincts and finding the way to transform into something that neat and perfect, that doesn't derive from the filth, or urges. But then again, Freud was not an artist? However... by casting one glance at the current phase and how distorted this world has become, I doubt that even aliens could do a lot about that. Even if Dave existed, which I also doubt. Well, if he did, I wouldn't let him go surfing the space, and copulate with a bunch of aliens. Tesla would advise him otherwise, so in the end I would probably have to make an ultimatum Me or him (them) &#150; make a choice!. And that would leave me heart-broken.The sad truth is, humans only reached the moon, stabbed a flag into it and came back here. A small step for a man, a giant leap for mankind. Of course it's a giant leap, since humanity is smaller than a fly's hive, even a fly would cross that route quicker, and reach it's destination! (One of the best parodies based on the trip to the moon was depicted in Baron Munchausen!) How far did we get really? Not too far, it seems. We are still amusing ourselves in the slime. We can't cure a pimple. And we are still underestimating the power of the dark side. Ooops, I mean, the power of the nature.Whether this movie would have such a significance in case the fetus didn't flash in front of our eyes in the end, is I guess, irrelevant. For it is perfect just the way it is. A pure, sublime fantasy. Along with the magnificent music, perhaps above everything else...

I like chick flicks and I'm not afraid to admit it. I can sit in front of this computer and glance at the television screen each time the scene changes and not have to look back. This is one of those films, but when Elizondo gets to cooking, all I can do is sit there and stare in envy at some of the things he can do with food. As much as he's succeeded with his profession in the kitchen, he sort of feel likes he's failed in the family department; not so much because any of his three daughters have failed at anything (quite the contrary), but because he feels like he's failed in teaching his family heritage to them and its values. He also feels pride in his work as a very accomplished chef, even though, as we find out early on, he's lost his sense of taste.Change happens in all families, and this family is no exception, but, as with everything else, change either brings us closer together in trying to overcome different adversities and obstacles, or drives us further apart. I'd recommend this movie to anyone who wonders about their values and where they should be going in life.9 out of 10 stars!!!

The idea is so ridiculous and bizarre that it's amazing it ever got made in the first place, let alone that it was so good! Martin Short inhabits the role of the perfectly named Jack Putter, a bumbling supermarket clerk with some major personal issues. He's awkward and nervous, like real life Woody Allen, and he's been suffering from a recurring daytime nightmare where a scary old woman berates him for ringing up her groceries wrong and then pulls a gun on him. Dennis Quaid is Tuck Pendleton, a cocky pilot\/scientist who is preparing for a miniaturization project where he will be shrunk to the size of a grain of sand and injected into a rabbit. Things get complicated when a group of terrorists break into the lab and try to steal the materials needed for the procedure, but they only get their hands on what is needed to restore Tuck to normal size. One scientist barely escapes with Tuck and the little submarine inside a syringe and ultimately he has to either surrender it to the bad guy chasing him (a stoic gentleman played by Vernon Wells, who you might remember as the main bad guy in Command) or inject it into the first subject he can get his hands on. Unluckily for hypochondriac Jack Putter, that happens to be him.Innerspace is a major milestone in my childhood, it's one of a handful of movies that I would watch over and over when I was a kid, along with other 80s classics like Commando, Weird Science, Sword in the Stone and Back to the Future. It's a rare example of all of the different parts of a movie working perfectly together, creating a wonderful bit of entertainment that is Great For The Whole Family. It's impossible not to love it when neurotic Jack Putter begins to be affected by Tuck swimming around his bloodstream, latching scary looking communication devices onto the back of his eyeball and the hooking up to his auditory nerves and literally becoming a voice inside his head. Brilliant! Meg Ryan gives a perfect performance as Tuck's girlfriend\/ex-girlfriend, and their relationship might be the most uniquely presented romance ever filmed. Classic! This is a definitely cinematic treasure, it's probably not going to be remembered as one of the best romantic comedies ever, but it is certainly among the most loved.

And the survivor could be the one who loves honestly for love, the one who's immaculate and ready to face !Perhaps, the end would be disappointing; it even may turn the whole thing into pointless movie. However, it got to end the 2 malicious worldly-wise leads by the hand of inexperienced idiot who closes her eyes while shooting guns, all for making the deep bitter paradox, and for the sake of assuring how a couple like this would one way or another end each other, and how the true lover can win at last.. Even forcedly!, especially with this easy naive solution of random festival of killing where the bad guys go to hell, and the kind one hits the jackpot, and wins the revenge; How poetic (and fabricated) this justice was! Not to mention that it didn't care about the rest of the characters' fates. Which ultimately stamped it with the deficient mark, and it is.Despite that, it managed somehow to embody the concept of (Bad Company) whereas it's not a bad intelligence, no, it's more like evil association that must eat and eat till it eats itself at the end. The movie's title got its double meaning already but the movie itself wasn't perfectly satisfying in the both lines, expressly the superficial one, so that's where all the bad feeling about the movie may come from.Director (Damian Harris) filled it with stylish style. Everything was beautiful and anesthetically colorful; the image was so soft, the cinematography and the editing were always smooth, the clothes seemed sharp, even the smallest details were fine. Something to attract, bewitch, and make the irony with all the putrefaction within. Where nothing is filthy but the whole moralities ! I loved the private agency's set; it looked like wealthy lockup, scary company, or fake monastery. Though I felt some coldness when it comes to dealing with what's inside the characters which left a clear bad mark on the acting. Ellen Barkin was highly bad, aside from a role was poorly written, her face was so provocatively dead and originally she's pathetically sexy to be that irresistible femme fatale !.Yes, it's partly amusing, acridly satirical, with a nasty character, capturing the outrageous sense of the 1980s' and the 1990s' erotic thrillers. But it's not a brilliant thriller inasmuch as a movie about utterly unfaithful world where all would kill or be killed simply for money and power. So when I listen to its clever sad music score I feel the real motive of the film, and I feel sad because it, as a whole, remains semi-contrived and imperfect though.
