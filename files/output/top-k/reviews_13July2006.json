Like THE JERK, this is a certain roughness about the script that make it very fresh and appealing but also pretty amateurish and stupid from time to time as well.Also, when I saw the film, I watched it with my grandfather. This was a very uncomfortable experience, as seeing an adult comedy with nudity in it with an 80 year-old relative just seems creepy. But, he sure laughed his head off, so I guess I was just the one with the hangup.Anyways, Steve Martin plays one of the foremost brain surgeons, Dr. Michael Hfuhruhurr (pronounced Hrrrr-rrrr-rrr). The way everyone had trouble pronouncing the name was pretty lame and was beaten like a dead horse. Well, despite this, the doctor has perfected the new screw top method of surgery and saves a beautiful lady (Kathleen Turner) from sure death.They fall in love and marry soon after. But, Kathleen seems intent on driving the doctor crazy, as she never seems willing to consummate their marriage. This lead to some very funny but crude jokes, by the way. However, despite her many excuses, he catches her being unfaithful many times and yet can't bring himself to divorce her.It is during this same time that he meets a very strange man, Dr. Alfred Necessiter (David Warner) who is doing unethical experiments with brains--wanting to put them in new bodies and revive them after the bodies had died. Necessiter's lab, by the way, is the coolest on the planet--you'll just have to see it to understand what I mean. For some inexplicable reason, Dr. Hfuhruhurr hears a voice coming from one of the brains! It seems they brain isn't quite dead and they fall in love (the scenes of them out on dates are priceless).But, what to do about the evil and unfaithful wife as well as this brain he's fallen for?!? Yep, you gotcha, the Windex Killer helps solve the problem and almost everyone lives happily ever after. And, since you probably have no idea what all this means, watch the movie yourself to find out and laugh out loud at all the silliness and high energy.

And some are more that amazing, that it's a shame movies are fantasies and not real life. The first time I watched AFO was way back, in 2002. Since then, I saw the movie other four times, but I didn't get bored, not even for a second. This film is so entertaining, that I'm sure I'll watch it over and over again. (And so should you!)Released in July,1997, AFO flew high, rapidly becoming a summer blockbuster, earning some 315 million dollars. And it's surely worth this money despite some minor flaws here and there, the movie is superbly crafted. It has all the ingredients for a blockbuster popular cast, great director,cool story and amazing special effects.Director Wolfgang Petersen did a great job, mixing action and suspense in ideal quantities and adding just a bit of drama to make the story more convincing.The plot line is great, absolutely breathtaking. It goes like this a commando team, formed out of American and Russian soldiers, capture General Ivan Radek. Three weeks later, the American President goes to Russia and holds an outstanding speech against international terrorism. On the way home, Russian terrorists devoted to Radek hijack Air Force One in order to demand the release of the general. Bodyguards try to save the President; they take him to the escape pod and jettison him. So they think. In fact, the President is still on board, angrier and meaner than ever, ready to fight against international terrorism. Many say this story is improbable,even more,impossible. Hello people! Because the presidential plane hasn't been hijacked yet, you can't blame the entire movie that it's impossible. And because we can't imagine Bush fighting with his bare hands with some (spoiler) bad-ass terrorists doesn't mean that the President should be a chicken. But why do some humans care so much about reality, as long as we're talking about movies? Movies are fantasies, they're unreal, that's why people call them movies. Their purpose is not to show reality, it's to transmit us messages or to show us what's good, and what's bad.Leading actor, Harrison Ford, does a great job playing the (spoiler) ass-kicker President, James Marshall. I'm sure if Kevin Costner had accepted the leading role, this movie wouldn't have been as good as we know it. Ford does an outstanding performance being a father, a husband, a world leader and a Medal of Honour winner from the Vietnam war. When terrorists seize the presidential plane, the Commander-in-Chief proves to be one heck of an adversary, killing the bad guys one by one. But don't get me wrong he's not a Dolph Lundgren-like killing machine; he's just trying to save his family and his employees from imminent death. Also, is it me or Ford looked as cool as ever in AFO? He was such a charismatic leader, and such a loving family man (although in real life, he left his kids and his wife, Mellisa Mathison, after 17 years of marriage)that it's a shame he's not the Commander-in-Chief. Also, I found out that Ford was really interested in this movie. He went with director Petersen and some other men to Andrews AF Base, to take a look inside one of the planes. But Clinton, who was with them, almost fined them, because they would have liked to see the jet's undercarriage.The other actors also did a great job. Gary Oldman is one mean, ruthless, Communist terrorist. He threatens the White House that he will kill a hostage at every half an hour, until his demands are made real. And he also lends his character, Egor Korshunov, a part of his intriguing insanity. You should surely be out of your minds, in order to hijack the plane carrying the American Prez, risking the outbreak of World War III. Glenn Close also does a cool performance, depicting the Vice President. Although she's at the White House, far away from the mid-air combat, she has to make some crucial decisions-like firing a heat-seeking missile towards Air Force One, which will not hit the plane, but shake it strongly, all this in order to help Prez Marshall defeat one of the terrorists. I could also detect a slight care towards the President (attention, First Lady!). Convincing roles are also those of Wendy Crewson and Liesel Matthews, a.k.a the wife and daughter of the President, William H. Macy-Major Cadwell, and Dean Stockwell-Defense Secretary Walter Dean. Here are 2 thumbs downthe film's casting took people into lots of confusion. Egor Korshunov became Ivan Korshunov and Ivan Radek became Alexander Radek. Another complaint is a plot hole left unsolvedwe do not find out why Agent Gibbs turned against Washington and allied with the terrorists. Maybe it was money, maybe it was brainwash.But the special effects are really good Extender 1-0 exploding in mid air, the President hanging out of Air Force One etc. all these scenes are simply breathtaking and nail-biting. Air Force One crashing into the Caspian Sea is also a well-made scene, even though the plane seems to cruise a bit slow and the water looks like concrete. You might take into consideration that way back,in 1997, Pentium II computers had just arrived.The soundtrack made by Jerry Goldsmith is awesome and helps you feel the intense suspense throughout the movie. It's an incredible job, if you think that the music had to be composed in just 2 weeks.And a major thumbs up for somethingthe nuclear code issue is solved in a fine way. In the end, I tell you all if you like good action movies,if you're H.F. fans or if you can take the credit that films are fantasy and not real life, go and watch AFO. And if you've already watched it, watch it again. I give it a 10 out of 10 for outstanding performance and for the incredible entertainment it offers to the public.

","genre":"Action, Adventure, Drama"},{"date":"13 July 2006","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Whether you love it or hate it, Monty Python is forever etched into British comedy history and this edition of the filmic Python exploits has stood the test of time, just.The thing with Monty Python is that it's very random. The bizarreness and variedness of the humour is really something to behold and there are numerous examples in this film alone which backs this up. Whether it's a completely random and insane discussion-come-argument about swallows to a really scathing, surreal attack on how the English dealt with the 'black death' or the 'plague' or whatever killer virus' were going around back then, in the carefree manner that is shown. It can be a joy to behold.With this film, we are instantly thrown into a world of confusion as the 'projectionist' actually loads up the wrong film to begin with. From here, you know something's up as no other film that I've ever seen or heard of has a beginning like this and you know that this is going to be different. Once the real film has started, the dialogue in the early scenes superbly juxtaposes the setting in 900 odd B.C. as political arguments and, as I've mentioned, discussions about migratory birds pop up. It feels like an extra long episode of a comic, sketch TV programme which has no real plot, but is just a montage of jokes and hilarious situations the characters find themselves in and this isn't a bad thing. The great thing about this is, is that the early situations and exchanges work as a flame for us, the moths, and it sets the stage very well; drawing us into the world of humour on show. Since no one around now knows exactly what happened in the time of the films setting, no one can argue whether any of this would really happen. Were minstrels who followed people\/knights around that annoying? What did knights guarding the turrets of castles actually do\/talk about to pass the time? Swallows maybe? Effective little scenarios like this make you wonder and it just adds to the genius of the writing.One of the early scenes has to be one of the funniest in films entire one hundred year plus history. This is the fight scene between Arthur and the black knight. Following on from a good fight scene, the black knight delivers some of the funniest lines in the most funniest of ways following his own decapitation.

Fortunately, they only last a few seconds (most of them) and don't distract you too much but why even bother to have them in the first place? The titles in-between the knight's own separate stories are fine but little things like the 'artist suddenly having a heart attack' just insult the viewer. Not good, unfortunately.I think most people would have a problem with the characters who talk to the screen, breaking the 'fourth wall', something which was stamped out of narrative film-making decades ago. I had a minor frustration with this as although it only happened twice from memory, it spoilt what was a perfectly good\/funny scene. The incident in the castle full of young girls is the one which immediately springs to mind as she starts talking to the audience. In an analytical sense, this is actually supposed to add to the experience in the sense that it's all theatre anyway and this film shouldn't be taken seriously.

I tried once, but found that the movie looked like an episode of MOMMA'S FAMILY where they finally gave everyone meat cleavers and told them to mix it up good!! It was that ugly and tough to watch in only the first 10 or 15 minutes, so I just turned it off and assumed it was not my type of movie. Thankfully, I tried it again and realized it was an exceptional film in every way.The movie is essentially a film about how everyone in the family is dealing with the imminent death of the family patriarch, Big Daddy. For some odd and annoying reason, everyone has nicknames like Big Momma, Big Sister, etc. but considering this is my only complaint, it's no big deal really.The problem is that the family is at heart really screwed up. The oldest son, played by Jack Carson, is the good son who became a lawyer and is superficially dutiful, though down deep he does everything to try to maneuver himself and his evil brood into the best position when the loot is divvied up when Big Daddy dies. It's totally sick the way he and his obnoxious brood fawn over Big Daddy so unconvincingly in order to ingratiate themselves.His wife, Mae, played by Madeleine Sherwood, is probably the most detestable of all the adults in the film. Just how awful she is is revealed more and more as the film progresses, as she has both the mouth and heart of a viper AND she choreographs the kids to do some major sucking up to Big Daddy. This sucking up is so saccharine and annoying that Big Daddy obviously detested the kids! The children are basically evil spawns of Satan, as their parents allow them to do ANYTHING so long as they suck up to Big Daddy and Big Mamma. When the film starts, one of the brats is reaching her hands into a big bowl of ice cream--ruining it for everyone. When she sees her Aunt Maggie (Liz Taylor) she throws a huge handful on her. Another of these darlings later laughs at Aunt Maggie and taunts her because she doesn't have any kids! They did a great job of playing horrid kids, as I found myself wanting to strangle them.Aunt Maggie is also pretty mercenary, though is much more subtle and likable than her brother-in-law and sister-in-law and the little demons. But she and her husband, Brick, played by Paul Newman, have a stormy marriage at best. Of all the kids and in-laws, the only one without designs on the fortune is Brick, who is so full of self-pity and self-loathing that all he really is interested in is staying drunk.Big Mamma, played by Judith Anderson, is pretty ineffectual and lives in a constant state of denial. Otherwise, she would have to admit to herself that her kids are creeps and her husband doesn't care at all about her.Big Daddy, played by Burl Ives, is a loud and obnoxious man who as insensitive and blunt. His way of showing love is through money and success. He appears to realize the score on everyone and where they stand--except for himself. Here he's got a huge blind spot--thinking he's done a fine job when the problems he sees are in many ways his own doing.Initially, Big Daddy thinks that the stomach pains he's been having are not very serious--after all, that's what the doctor has told him. However, he's dying of cancer and his time left is very short. Once he learns this is so, he actually stops yelling and the most poignant part of the film begins. His conversation with Brick about the illness and the future is one of the finest moments in movie history. In particular, Paul Newman's performance nearly brought me to tears. It was only then that real raw feelings and pain began to emerge and the movie began to feel so real and wonderful.Where all this goes from there you just need to see for yourself. I had a hard time choosing whether or not to give the movie a 9 or a 10, but I tend to be more conservative than some and reserve 10s for only a very select group of films--and this one nearly made it.

Hutton, Jack Grinnage, Dick Winslow, Raymond Bailey, Leon Tyler...Direcor Michael Curtiz...Screenplay Herbert Baker, Based On The Novel By Harold Robbins By 1958, when this film was released, there was not a single American (unless they were Amish or lived in a cave) who didn't know who Elvis Presley was. The popular singer's albums sold fast and his concerts and performances in Las Vegas and on TV drove dozens of young teenage girls crazy. He fancied himself an actor as well or he opted to make movies to cater to his fans. Back then if you wanted to see Elvis shake his waist and hips (which you couldn't see on TV because of censorship)you could see it if you went to see his movies. Director Michael Curtiz was a fine director with great films (better than this one) to his credit- Santa Fe Trail (1940) The Sea Hawk (1940) and of course his masterpiece Casablanca (1942). The director of Casablanca was a noted Hollywood moviemaker and to engage Elvis in a film must have been awfully good for his career. In King Creole, he plays Danny Fisher a New Orleans rebel, the son of a well-to-do and respectable politician (or something like that) who flunks out of high school and decides to sing in nightclubs instead. His father wants him to marry the wealthy and sweet Nel (Dolores Hart)and to change his life for the better. But in his nightclub, Danny discovers a seedy world of corruption and danger. He encounters the beautiful, seemingly comfortable but unhappy Ronnie (Carolyn Jones) the sweetheart of a powerful mob lord. He's drawn to her on an emotional and physical level but he's torn between both his own sweetheart and Ronnie. A young Walter Matthau plays mob lord Maxie Field, with a degree of nastiness and abusive dominance, fueled by alcoholism. There are songs but this is not a musical. The songs are featured in the appropriate scenes in which Danny sings in the nightclub. This was a style of movies that Elvis did at the time although he was also in musicals. But this is one film in which he attempted to act. For fans of Elvis, he's wonderful in this role which suits him but I personally don't think he's much of an actor and he was the first celebrity to prove that singers should not transition into film acting. Later on, singers like Madonna would do the same thing in the 80's and 90's and fail miserably. But this type of a film is a time capsule of the 50's and therefore has value. Elvis would do several films in color in the 60's as well but quit after he began to age visibly. Carolyn Jones is his leading lady in this film. Sadly, she's not a well-known actress. She is known only for her role as Morticia Addams in the memorable and much loved TV comedy series The Addams Family (1964-1966). Give this woman some credit. She was an outstanding actress with tons of films and TV series in her resume. Here, she is subtle next to the more dramatic Elvis but she shows moments of angst in a very dramatic, sort of soap-opera-ish way. She's really good. Her voice is especially essential in her acting and it helped that she was very beautiful. This is a lovely film with an emotional core and with lots of great singing, especially the last song.

Hutton, Jack Grinnage, Dick Winslow, Raymond Bailey, Leon Tyler...Direcor Michael Curtiz...Screenplay Herbert Baker, Based On The Novel By Harold Robbins By 1958, when this film was released, there was not a single American (unless they were Amish or lived in a cave) who didn't know who Elvis Presley was. The popular singer's albums sold fast and his concerts and performances in Las Vegas and on TV drove dozens of young teenage girls crazy. He fancied himself an actor as well or he opted to make movies to cater to his fans. Back then if you wanted to see Elvis shake his waist and hips (which you couldn't see on TV because of censorship)you could see it if you went to see his movies. Director Michael Curtiz was a fine director with great films (better than this one) to his credit- Santa Fe Trail (1940) The Sea Hawk (1940) and of course his masterpiece Casablanca (1942). The director of Casablanca was a noted Hollywood moviemaker and to engage Elvis in a film must have been awfully good for his career. In King Creole, he plays Danny Fisher a New Orleans rebel, the son of a well-to-do and respectable politician (or something like that) who flunks out of high school and decides to sing in nightclubs instead. His father wants him to marry the wealthy and sweet Nel (Dolores Hart)and to change his life for the better. But in his nightclub, Danny discovers a seedy world of corruption and danger. He encounters the beautiful, seemingly comfortable but unhappy Ronnie (Carolyn Jones) the sweetheart of a powerful mob lord. He's drawn to her on an emotional and physical level but he's torn between both his own sweetheart and Ronnie. A young Walter Matthau plays mob lord Maxie Field, with a degree of nastiness and abusive dominance, fueled by alcoholism. There are songs but this is not a musical. The songs are featured in the appropriate scenes in which Danny sings in the nightclub. This was a style of movies that Elvis did at the time although he was also in musicals. But this is one film in which he attempted to act. For fans of Elvis, he's wonderful in this role which suits him but I personally don't think he's much of an actor and he was the first celebrity to prove that singers should not transition into film acting. Later on, singers like Madonna would do the same thing in the 80's and 90's and fail miserably. But this type of a film is a time capsule of the 50's and therefore has value. Elvis would do several films in color in the 60's as well but quit after he began to age visibly. Carolyn Jones is his leading lady in this film. Sadly, she's not a well-known actress. She is known only for her role as Morticia Addams in the memorable and much loved TV comedy series The Addams Family (1964-1966). Give this woman some credit. She was an outstanding actress with tons of films and TV series in her resume.

It is a classic for a reason, this film tells a great story, tells a love story and is a political commentary at the same time, all while being supremely entertaining.From start to finish this movie continues to pull you in, and makes remarkable references to world events at the time. You are introduced to Rick, played by the legendary Humphrey Bogart, an American who sticks his neck out for nobody but who was fought bravely in the past against the same type of enemy the other characters are up against. This is clearly a singular personification of the history and the stance America had in 1941 prior to Pearl Harbor. Early in the story we see the keys to salvation handed over to him by Ugarte, played by Jewish actor Peter Lorre, who himself fled from the Nazi's in 1933 to come to America. Ugarte who is killed summarily early on in the story is something of a representative of the heartless horrors that Jewish refugees were telling of what was happening to Jews in Nazi Europe at the time. Rick is now the safeguard of letters of transit which play an important role and overall become a character in their own.Taking place in what can only be described as purgatory we are introduced to a host of characters that need help to get out and the ones that prey on those needing that help. In this place the Vichy French, under influence of the Nazi's rule the land, and their prefect, the corrupt but still somehow noble in a way, Captain Renault, who becomes a representative of all French who wish to be free of Nazi rule, mainly because he doesn't like being told what to do more than anything. It is into this we see the great conflict as Victor Laslo, a legendary Czech freedom fighter against Nazi rule is brought into the story. Victor becomes a representative of all of Europe that needs the help of America, and as the singular American in the story, speaking for all of us he seeks out Rick, who now holds the key to Victors, and his wife's freedom. With the introduction of Victor Laslo we meet his wife Ilsa Lund, played by Ingrid Bergman, who we learn has had a past with Rick, a past that has scarred them both, but their feelings still remain. Here we see the American past with Europe personified, we have a past with that continent and most of us love that past but we want our own future and now our past love needs our help, so Rick has to come to the rescue. This relationship is summed up in one line Ilsa says to Rick you have to think for both of us, for all of us where we see the desperation and the need for salvation.The climax to the movie is a masterful one, where a race to get Victor and Ilsa on the last plane out of Casablanca is taking place, where Rick has weaved a web of decit that bravely ensures they will get out alive if all goes according to plan. Prior to their escape one of the most famous monologues takes place that almost brings tears to the eyes of all who see it. And after the dust has settled Rick, the American, and Captain Renault the Frenchmen who has realigned his allegiances and saved Rick from the Nazi's walk off into the foggy night in what is the beginning of a beautiful friendship where side by side the Americans will stand with the French against the Nazi's.In the end we see it as a highly critical editorial commentary made by Warner Brothers of the stance America had before entering the war. It also stands as a noble and optimistic beacon for events to come.

Both these films are slow but there is a difference, which I think I've figured out. Once Upon a Time in America is slow because it has an attitude. This attitude needs to play itself out over each scene. Example Noodles returns to gang headquarters and stirs his coffee for two minutes. The gang know that something has gone wrong between him and Deborah and want him to discuss it. Noodles does not want to discuss it and so stirs his coffee until someone talks about something else. The Godfather is slow because nothing happens. Example The scenes in the hospital with Michael and Don Vito. Nothing is going on. It's no fun to watch. It's not entertaining. Still, come to think of it, Once Upon a Time in America is not exactly entertaining as such. Those rape scenes are really horrible and I, personally, can't watch them. However, one can appreciate how great a film it is and what an achievement in story-telling. Leone does not attempt to make these men seem sympathetic because they are bad men. And though it seems simplistic to say it; bad men do bad things. What can you do? That is just one facet of the strength of the movie, though. The child actors are a revelation. The kid who plays Dominic is brilliant, why we never saw more of him and less of Macauly Culkin is anybody's guess. The other thing is that they look just like young versions of the older actors. The final word, however, must go to Robert de Niro and James Woods. James Woods has rarely been better. He's come close, no doubt about that but never bettered. De Niro is on excellent form with a marvellously restrained performance. Sometimes you have to have a protagonist who is not an extrovert and this is just that character. Noodles, as portrayed by De Niro, is unhappy with his lot for several reasons and let's people know about subtley. The best Leone film? Difficult to say. They're all great films so this would definitely rank as one of the best and certainly deserves more praise than it gets, even now, in the film world.

At first he attempts to use these powers for personal gain. When a wrestling promoter screws him over, he lets a criminal rob him. Later, his Uncle Ben is shot and killed by the same man. He realizes that he can't let that happen to anybody ever again, so he becomes Spider-Man. Not long after, his first big threat arrives, the maniacal Green Goblin, who, unbeknownst to Peter, is the scientist father of his best friend.The reason Spider-Man was such a big hit is because it had the same epic potential as Superman. The fan base was huge to begin with, so hype for the movie was unequaled by anything else. The reason I liked it so much was because it followed a perfect superhero movie formula. Adequate time was spent on all the aspects of the story. The origin, the honing of his special powers, a few fights with petty criminals, the first fight with the villain, a small confrontation in between, and the final climatic battle. In between all of this is the personal drama. Sam Raimi was able to successfully tie all that in and make it work in the 2 hour time frame. He was able to show how Peter Parker's life changes when he becomes Spider-Man.Raimi set the world of Spider-Man in a realistic world. A lot of people didn't like the Green Goblin in this movie, stating he looked like a Power Rangers villain. I disagree. Norman Osborn created an armoured flight suit for soldiers to wear, so the armoured green suit was perfectly fine with me. Spider-Man is, in my books, the most accurate comic book movie out there, besides Sin City at least. Another thing some fans missed was Spider-Man's trademark wisecracks toward his enemies. While this is a part of his character, I thought it made him more serious. I mean, who can really think up that much stuff to say while deep in battle. Also, the situation isn't that funny, so why make jokes? What disappointed me most about the movie was the campy dialogue in some scenes. Some of the lines that come out of characters' mouths in this movie are way too cheesy. Also, the CGI is really underdeveloped. Other than that, this movie has nothing wrong with it.The acting is really good. I hated the idea of Tobey Maguire playing Spider-Man until I saw the movie. Now there's no one else. He really shocked me with how well he played the role. I didn't know he could be tough when he wanted to! Willem Dafoe is great as Norman Osborn\/Green Goblin. He plays the perfect bad guy, and plays a great nut case too.Overall, Spider-Man is a great comic book film, and if the dialogue was 100% cool throughout the movie and the CGI was flawless, it would get a 10 out of me.

All of the actors are in top form and the movie is so wonderful EXCEPT that the whole crux of Liz's mental problems is only vaguely alluded to due to the social conventions of the time. I'll discuss this at the end of the review, so if you don't want to know what it is, skip this portion.Liz plays the niece of a very rich and very controlling matriarch (Katherine Hepburn) who is dead set on having her lobotomized by the psychiatrist, played by Montgomery Clift. Since returning from a trip with Sebastian, Liz has been very troubled. Something traumatic obviously happened there and Sebastian died, but instead of investigating what occurred, it seems that Katherine Hepburn wants her lobotomized to shut her up once and for all.But Clift is an ethical and reasonable doctor who won't just do a lobotomy just to please the aunt--even if it means that the huge endowment she is dangling in front of him is withheld. Of all the characters in the film, he seems like the only sane one with a soul.Instead of discussing the plot further, I want to point out that the direction and writing were excellent as was most of the acting (though Liz Taylor's delivery of her lines sounded very staccato--like James T. Kirk), but the main problem was the sanitized script. Some idiots at the studio decided to drastically change Tennessee Williams' play due to 1950s sensibilities. In a way, I almost wished they had just waited a decade and then filmed it so they could honestly reproduce the play. Instead, what was apparent in the play is boiled down to a deep dark secret--and it never is directly talked about. So in other words, why Liz went with Sebastian and why he died (awfully important parts of the story, don't you think?) were never dealt with! It turns out that the entire deep dark secret is that Sebastian was GAY! But, they instead make allusions such as his closeness to his mother and the fact that he liked to have her around on a vacation because she attracted men (of course, she would most likely have attracted straight men, so this didn't make a lot of sense)! So much would have been cleared up if they just said he was gay. I knew that this must be the unspoken secret--or, perhaps the crowd killed him because he was a pedophile. It sure makes a difference to me, as in the first case you feel pity for Sebastian.This COULD have been a great film instead of an excellent one in search of a remake.

It is a joy (or a nightmare, depending on your own views) to hear him deliver a line like I think these Ethiopians like starving, it keeps them slim and graceful.

She decides she could use some love and adventure in her life again and starts an intimate relationship with a client of said restaurant. Albert is blissfully unaware of this and fails to notice this relationship, because he is too caught up in his egotistical pursuits. The cook is the balance in this whole story, he provides the necessary comfort, wise advice and off course the gourmet feasts that Spica values so much. However while Albert Spica stands out as the true villain, in the end all of them are damned by committing a truly repulsive act. Some might call it poetic justice for Albert Spica... In the meantime there's Albert Spica, a man bereft of all basic table-manners and conscience, hilariously trying to teach his cronies etiquette. The film is visually beautiful.

Anyone who loved film probably saw it and couldn't help but embrace it as a masterpiece. This is probably why the Academy nominated it for Best Picture and why so many people still revere it today. Watching it for the first time in 2006, I found myself very disappointed. NASHVILLE is a chaotic mess which bored my wife to sleep and left me wishing I had put another movie in my queue. There were a few good moments (Tomlin's relationship with her deaf children and Carradine's musical solo) but a few good moments don't make for a great movie, especially for a movie that is two hours and forty minutes long. After the last scene I found myself thinking the entire experience was pointless. One might accuse me of wanting a film to think for me, but that is not the case; I want a movie to have something for me to think about. It was sort of like a time capsule you can't wait to open only to find an assortment of uninteresting, dated newspaper clippings. I can appreciate Altman's brave attempt to make something different, but the film just doesn't hold up. For anyone claiming that the movie captures life and that life is random just like the movie, I can only I disagree and admit I want a movie to affect me first and worry about recreating life second. Though if you don't mind a lack of plot, enjoy stories without a main character (especially with numerous insipid ones) and you love studying the behavior of people for the sake of it, you might like this movie. I loathed most of it and I would not recommend the movie to anyone I know.
