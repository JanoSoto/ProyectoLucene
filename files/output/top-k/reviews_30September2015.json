[{"date":"30 September 2015","score":"","review":" Students suspect that their teachers are aliens after bizarre occurrences.This is very much a film of the 1990s, especially the second half. That same teen horror subgenre that Scream mastered and Disturbing Behavior did well. Get a mix of teen idols, add a soundtrack, and boom, you have a film. This is no exception, with some of the biggest names of the time on the screen (now, about fifteen years later, it is interesting to see who is big and who is forgotten).As far as being a body snatcher movie, it is pretty good. It is obviously aware of its past, as it overtly makes reference. But it also tries to steer clear of being a copy. Some references to past films are over the top, such as naming a character Edward Furlong. Really? Although not one of Robert Rodriguez's best films, it is still a nice trip down nostalgia lane. And it is probably not his worst (it may be time to stop with the Spy Kids and Machete sequels).

This movie had everything; good acting, name-brand main actors and actresses, a compelling story, social pertinence and a theme of victory over adversity. All the things that I admire and enjoy in a film. The reasons I was only prepared to give what I deem a passing grade to Music of the Heart are these; 1.) What did Mrs. Guaspari do to motivate and engage these students? Bark out orders? 2.) Why, in the absence of Mrs. Guaspari's inspiration, did the students (individually or collectively) want to take up the violin? (We never really get to meet any of the students, nor find out what is important (or at least intriguing) to them. 3.) Why does Mrs. Guaspari not play something impressive for the students, to show what they can accomplish, and how wonderful the violin can sound? ( Initially, to wow the students, 20 seconds of Shostakovich or D'Vorak would have been sufficient, but the film should have been replete with pertinent and brilliant, even if abbreviated, violin music, played by Mrs. Guaspari). 4.) What inspired Mrs. Guaspari to take up the violin, and why does she play? What is her relationship to music?This last point is the most glaring omission in Music of the Heart.It was heart-breaking to see Tanisha informing her teacher that she was moving away and had to quit the classes. Could not have Mrs. Guaspari said, at least, I will call you, if you want. I will continue to help you with your violin.?I appreciated Music of the Heart. I love all movies that have to do with music (especially learning it). The Guaspari family went through a great deal of duress as they tried to make ends meet. In the process, they changed some lives. I just would have liked to have gotten to know the characters more; their inner motivation and dreams.
