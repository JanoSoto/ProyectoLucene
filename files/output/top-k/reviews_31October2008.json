I am and have been for many years a Bergman fan. I eagerly saw most of his films as they were released. I love nearly all of them - this one being an exception. Certainly the film is worth seeing - any Bergman film is. But this one is often cited as his best, and there I would strongly disagree. It is about an academic and although professor Borg has to face some of his demons, he comes out on top in then end. I understand why this film is so popular. Academics see themselves in professor Borg and academics have a lot of influence on what is considered art and what isn't. Borg ends up looking good at the end of the film, and academics, although they have their faults like anyone else, like to think that they are worthy of the respect that their position commands. In many, many cases they are - and this is not a diatribe against academics. I just think that Bergman let this character off too easily, particularly when you compare the way he treats his other characters in movies like The Hour of the Wolf, The Silence, Shame and so on. He plumbs the depths of the soul and takes no prisoners. Wild Strawberries starts out that way, when the professor flashes back to the key points in his life where he turned away from love, life and reality in favor of academic honor. But ultimately Bergman backs down. The professor, having seen the errors of a lifetime in a few short hours, is shown to be wiser and a better man now as he receives his honorary award. Bergman does not do this in his other films. For me this gives a certain falsity to Wild Strawberries that I don't see in Persona for example. Well, everyone will probably disagree with me, - this is such an acclaimed film - but sometimes it is valuable to hear a contrarian opinion even when you don't agree with it.

And that's people who love dogs and are willing to do whatever it takes to get that coveted blue ribbon and ultimately, the gold cup. For those who are familiar with this sport, and especially those who have participated in showing dogs, this is one of the funniest movies around. Sure, there are a lot of continuity errors, and in fact a few factual errors when showing a dog, such as all small breeds are brought to a table, and when Winky is in the final round he is not brought up to the table, but the rest of the movie is so good one tends to overlook these small things. Then we break it down to specific people and breeds (though some think the 2 are interchangeable or indistinguishable). There are the terrier people, and Cookie (O'Hara) and Gerry (Levy) are perfect as the human low-end (and I mean no disrespect here) of the dog-show circuit but who manage to have themselves a great dog. Then we have the yuppie couple, played so well by Posey and Hitchcock, whose lives are so wrapped around what their precious dog is thinking they actually make it worse not only for themselves but for the dog. Good acting also by this particular dog to be able to just lie around or stand without looking at all the chaos going on around her (must be an obedience champion as well). Then we have Guest as the owner of a Bloodhound, and his character was right on the money, even down to the way he talks to the hound. You talk differently to different breeds. (Hard to explain, but if you have never been to a dog show, go to one. Just remember that before a dog is shown the handlers and owners are very busy and do not have time to talk, and whatever you do, do not talk to them in front of a ring, or worse, try to pet the dog.) Of course there are the rich owners who hire the very best handlers and hardly even notice their dogs, other than as a means to an end (breeding). And let it be known that Coolidge is probably one of our most under-rated actresses around. That in every scene she is eating is a running gag that works. And of course, no dog show would be complete without the gay couple and how the handler gets all testy when the co-owner\/partner is bothering him. What I liked a lot about this movie was that not only was it about a sport I used to participate in, but we got a decent background story on all the characters, dogs included. And the color commentary done by Willard has to be some of the funniest stuff around. That Piddock could keep a straight face was amazing since I read that there was a lot of ad-libbing going on. I also liked the fact that real winners were used as well as real handlers and owners used not only in the movie, but were there to make sure that what we saw was what actually occurs, right down to the clothing a handler wears (again, back to the type of breed and the people who own\/handle them).

Romero took the world by storm with an incredibly violent, low-budget, horror film that introduced what would grow to be the modern day interpretation of the living dead (referred to as zombies by most modern day moviegoers). These creatures are the reanimated corpses of the recently deceased, they shuffle, moan and eat the flesh of the living, and the only ways to kill them being incineration and a fatal blow to the head.How do these pitiful excuses for monsters bring in the scares within this low-budget exploitation film? I'd have to place my bet on the claustrophobic atmosphere Romero creates within the farmhouse, where ninety-five percent of the film takes place. In films such as Dawn, and Day of the Dead the characters had a lot more maneuverability. They could run, they could hide, and easily out maneuver these slow, clumsy creatures. Here, there is no room to move about, and you can feel that there truly is no way out, and no place to hide.The film starts as a brother and sister drive to apply the annual decoration to their father's grave. The two individuals are Barbra and Johnny, and as the two leave they are assaulted by a man. Barbra flees to a nearby farmhouse, and the story begins. Soon after she arrives she encounters a strong willed man by the name of Ben, who quickly establishes that Barbra is hysterical and must be taken care of. Taking responsibility for both their survival Ben soon boards up the doors and windows, preparing to sit the infestation out until help arrives.During the stay they discover some more survivors living in the house's cellar. There's the eager to help young man by the name of Tom, and his loyal girlfriend Judy, and then the paranoid Harry Cooper, his wife Helen, and their ill daughter Karen. Mister Cooper instantly protests against the command of Ben, saying that they all should retreat to the cellar, because there's only one way in and out of the cellar, as opposed to the house with its many doors and windows. Ben denies this, not wanting to be enclosed in a death trap without any means of escape if things were to go badly (which you know they will). In the end it seems only ironic as to how each character meets his or her fate.This film has rightfully earned its reputation as one of the best horror movies to date, and still beats out all of today's zombie films by a mile. Here the zombies really are scary, without resorting to being anything more than slow moving, clumsy beings (unlike the remake of Dawn of the Dead where they felt inclined to super power the creatures). Also, the setting is so normal it further increases the scare factor. How many people haven't been in houses like the one in this film? Imagine being trapped in one of these houses, surrounded by vicious flesh-eaters in the late hours of the night. This is where Night of the Living Dead succeeds where others of the genre have miserably fallen. If it wasn't for the original Night of the Living Dead, and Dawn of the Dead (both of which have been remade with a less positive response from critics and audiences alike) zombies would be some of the worst movie monsters ever conceived. This film innovated and created the concept of the living dead which have been embraced by mainstream audiences, and it is fitting that it is perhaps the ONLY film involving the creatures that has legitimately frightened me. Maybe it was watching it at night with the lights turned off, but I can say that few films have actually scared me when I watched it. With this film I was constantly holding my breath, and looking about the room nervously.The reason I was frightened (and surprised) by this film was due to its incredibly fast pacing, which is very similar to the way films are made today. This film just never has its dull moments (not to say I like all action, I was just surprised how quick it was). The plot is extraordinarily simple, and could have easily been covered in thirty minutes, but Romero was careful to grab the audience in the first attack scene, and keep their attention through means of suspense and violence.Now that brings us to the violence, and there is nothing that the undead are more associated with then excessive amounts of blood and gore. For the 1960s this film is incredibly violent, especially when it shows the undead feeding on the flesh of their victims. Being low-budget the victims are not seen being torn apart like they are in the sequels, but you still are given some disgusting shots of flesh from the bones, or fighting over intestines, which in some perverse way reminded me of people fighting over a chicken wing at a local KFC buffet. The images are just truly grotesque, maybe not to the avid, modern day gore lover, but to the common moviegoer it still holds up as being disturbing.This is the best film of the living dead sub-genre, followed closely by its sequel, Dawn of the Dead, and certainly holds up in all regards to the modern, brainless horror film. The film goes out to scare, and manages to pull it off, even to this day. With their decline as an actual icon of terror, at least we can still return to the gut wrenching human struggle, and terror of George A. Romero's definitive horror picture.5\/5 stars; a classic that has endured the test of time with more strength, emotionally, and in the form of pure terror, than many films of the same era which possessed a larger budgets, certainly being on par with some of Hitchcock's greats.

The father is a bully and a drunk. The mother is ineffectual, and doesn't even stand up for her children when they are being badly treated or even hit by her husband.she spends her time pursing her lips or waving her arms in frustration. The sister is vulgar as hell and is so completely dislikable in her opening wedding preparations scenes that it is difficult to warm to her later, although she ALMOST managed to break through my reserve for her in a few later scenes, mainly when she is being loving and protective of her older brother. The grandmother seems to be played on two notes only - sweetly senile or bossily mean, convulsed with religious intolerance. The youngest sister\/daughter is just a rude, uncontrollable brat. And Sweet William is ...well, so sweet that he seems to more or less forgive everyone and never get really mad at any of what is going on around him. The only person in the entire film that I could sort of warm to was Fletcher - who is luckily not a part of this family and actually seems human and decent, if a bit selfish.Now, I have seen dysfunctional families before, on and off screen - but here there is no indication that anyone is capable of simply being normal for even two minutes. Except for William, every one of them is murderously mean, nasty, muck-mouthed, intense and twitchy in all situations. ALL THE TIME! In the end, they come across as cardboard cut-outs rather than real people, every one of them (except William and Fletcher) overacting like crazy.There were a few moments in the film that were touching and\/or calm, but they were few and far between.

The effects were done by Industrial Light and Magic which should tell you how good it is even by today's standards. The effects and puppets are believable to the point that you don't notice them as being puppets and effects, they pull you further into the story rather than have you sitting there thinking oh yeah that's a puppet.At 33 I have seen this film too many times to count, and I get upset when it has been on TV and I have missed it, because I will happily sit down and watch it time and time and time again.One thing I will say as a word of warning, watch this one and avoid the two sequels like the plague. The sequels are done by completely different people, and are nowhere near the standard of this one. The actors look nothing like the originals, and the effects are not up to the standard of ILM's.

The cinematography is so gorgeous and so sparse in that we see so little that the suspense is just dripping off the screen. One of my favorite examples of this isn't the shower scene, but the death of Det. Arbogast. He walks up a set of stairs to investigate, and he's just calmly walking up the stairs when we see a door open ever so slightly on the balcony, unseen by Arbogast. He reaches the top of the stairs, and then the killer walks out and stabs him, which causes him to fall down the stairs. The way that he falls is so creepy because he falls in such a supernatural way that it just sticks out in your mind. I think of that one as a highlight just as much as the infamous shower scene. A sexy scene that includes probably the most famous death scene in film history, and you're knowledge of it is probably going to get you amped up to see it better than I can describe it to you, so I'll just let you see it without my ranting on it. A great scene, without violence or obvious nudity really shows the genius that Hitchkock was known for the time it was made.

You can tell that the way he's saying things and how he's saying them, you know something is off, and yet he keeps an air of respectability that lends itself perfectly to his character. Even the motel where they're staying is like that. The dark interiors, the weird stuffed animals along the walls, and the secrecy that surrounds it is remarkable that most of the time we are wondering the secrets behind it. That is a sign of good film-making giving the viewer very little information about a location, but what we have is just enough to give them a little jolt whenever it comes into question with the rest of the scene. Perhaps something that can easily help a film build suspense is it's score, and the screeching violins playing in the background of so many scenes is the perfect way to build suspense. It has the effect of being able to draw in a viewer and then fading away while the suspense is dripped out of the scene. Very rarely do I actually like a musical score for a film, but this is one of the few exceptions. And the last five minutes? Wow, I really doubt that anyone else in history has ever finished a film as shocking as this one. This, before the time of the twist ending common in many horror films, may have been started here.

With nine films in the franchise, there is simply nowhere to go but upwards, and that's exactly where the tenth Friday The 13th (get it, Jason X?) takes us. Like Pinhead and Leprechaun before him, Jason is thrusted into the outer reaches of space and resumes his slaughter of bad characters aboard a cheap looking spacecraft. However, unlike previous slashers gone skyward, Jason's adventure in space is actually an enjoyable trip.First things first, this is not a scary, suspenseful or even remotely serious horror film. If you are hoping to squeeze any genuine thrills out of this movie, don't bother. However, if you are a lifelong Friday The 13th fan who has seen enough of Crystal Lake and doesn't take one's self too seriously, then saddle up and enjoy the best Jason movie in a long while. That's right, I said it. Most people are wound too tight and take their precious genre favorites too seriously, but not me. When I want to unwind on a Friday night, have a few beers and turn my brain off, I find there is nothing more suiting than Jason X. With it's winning combination of nudity, bloodshed, nostalgia (sleeping bags, anyone?) and sense of humor, it doesn't matter that some parts of the film are a bit dodgy. Despite the ridiculous premise -- a group of students find a frozen, hockey-masked, machete clutching meat-bag and thaw him out on the way home -- and the lack of substantial special effects (those exteriors were a JOKE) there is still quite a bit of juice in this installment. Kane Hodder is back as Jason for what would unfortunately be his final round. Hodder goes all out, playing the uber-angry Jason that he created for The New Blood and even manages to make a ridiculous cyborg version of Jason seem menacing. Director James Isaac, a David Cronenberg (who cameos in this flick) protégé, delivers an unusually (for this franchise) stylish show, and despite the meager production values, gets the job done effectively. The movie looks good, even when it looks bad, if that makes any sense. It also helps that the movie was built off a script by a Joe-blow nobody fan in Todd Farmer. Farmer apparently loves Jason as much as he watches the SciFi channel, and it shows. You'll have a blast catching all the call-backs to previous movies and the little inside jokes that only a well-versed fan could possibly catch. Now, as you're reading this review, you're probably asking yourself What's the downside of this film? Well, I'm not sorry to say this; There is nothing wrong with this film. You go into a movie like Jason X -- the ninth sequel in an overly saturated franchise, which finds the title character in space -- and what do you honestly expect? If you can, God forbid, suspend disbelief, stop taking yourself and the films seriously for 90 minutes, you too will have a blast with Jason X.

It is interesting, then, when one considers the clichés of the mummy movie that became a staple of the sub-genre, (the slowly shuffling, bandage-wrapped title figure, Tana leaves, reincarnated princesses, mummification as punishment for forbidden love, Ancient Egyptian cults) it is here, rather, than the original that they were first introduced to the public. This film is the starting point for all the misconceptions about the genre, and it therefore deserves some props from that. The film itself, though, does have some other good points. The burial scene, told in flashback, is quite effectively done and manages to create a real air of suspense and atmosphere that the other sequels rarely achieved. The excavation is nicely played out, giving some humor to the way the tomb is uncovered. Kharis, the mummy, looks the best in all the sequels in this one. With a little post-production magic where his eyes were scribbled out, Kharis here has an eerie intensity missing from the remaining sequels. The small attempts at humor early are a nice change of tone from the first one, and are a welcome change.The Bad News Even though it is the best of the sequels, this one isn't as perfect as the original. The differing tone from the first one is likely to not sit well with some, as it's now a knock-off of the Abbott and Costello films that would later actually become reality. The fact that the mummy here for the first time is actually the traditional stereotypical one many think of, it has a tendency to devolve into self-parody when we see Kharis shambling around in the later half of the film. Despite the short running time, there are several instances where stock footage has been inserted into the movie, and while it's not a great crime, the scenes that were selected are.The Final Verdict While it's impossible to come anywhere close to the original, this one is actually surprisingly watch able.

During conversation, it appears that Dr. Bedlo still harbors deep resentments toward Dr. Scarabus and challenges him to a duel of magic. While trying to spout off his magic, Dr. Bedlo disappears. Staying overnight, his son develops a suspicion that Dr. Scarabus was behind the whole disappearance. He realizes he was wrong about the disappearance, but right about the foul play. Dr. Scarabus wanted them to come to the castle to harvest Dr. Craven's magic. The two finally have a showdown for the ultimate sorcerer.The Good News This is one of Corman's few films were he is able to use mood and atmosphere very well. This is nowhere more apparent than in the beginning of the movie. While recapturing the opening lines of the poem perfectly, Craven walks around his room searching vainly for the source of a mysterious noise. He hears knocking on the door and goes out check. No one is there. He then hears some more tapping noises at his window. He opens the door and finds nothing. A raven flies down and startles him. It was a scene that was one of my favorites, as well as the final confrontation between Karloff and Price. The magic used to combat the other was very inventive and was realistic at how two sorcerers would fight each other. Even the special effects used in the fight were a nice surprise. Considering the time that the movie was made, it looks good the way that they filmed it's special effects. All this aside, the best part of the movie is the highly unexpected comedy. Lorre has a lot of those lines that aren't exactly funny, yet they are lines. The best one has to be Lorre telling Price that he wants to challenge Karloff to a duel of magic, but only if he was sober, which he rarely was. The way Lorre said that was the key to it's humor. It was also pretty funny how he kept referring to his son as a brain-dead idiot. We even got some great physical humor, people bumping into walls, slamming into each other, or other forms of slapstick. I was glad, as Corman isn't exactly a master comedy director.The Bad News The opening of the movie is Vincent Price reciting the Edgar Allen Poe poem of the same name. Even though it fit with the movie, I thought that it was merely an uninteresting way to start the movie. Price has a fine voice, but all it did in the scene was to provoke dreary-ness for one of the few times even in a Price movie. Corman could've thought of any number of ways to make the scene better.

The imposition and slight conventional ideology may have you raising an eyebrow as the scheme starts to take place but bear with it as the crazy ideologies and dark imagery will take over and create an ultimate enjoyable fantasy with sensational acting and characters.Raul Julia gives an unusual performance as Gomez Addams, a crazed and vibrant man with a sharp confidence and dominance. When we see him teeing off on top of his roof we know this character is something very different and the writing is so sharp and exquisite that Gomez has become an icon in the comedy horror genre. Every performance in this film is especially sweet but Julia steals the show with an utterly astounding act.Huston (Prizzi's honour) creates another memorable protagonist in Morticia, Gomez's wife. Her delicate and light heartedness somehow fit in the dark and gruesome tale and her on screen moments with Gomez are those of a dark fairytale. Not discounting Lloyd (One flew over the cuckoo's nest) who is always impressive in whatever film he stars in takes himself to an even higher level with his role as Gordon.All characters truly look the part with Oscar nominated costume design. The black clothes and the white make up create a ghostly feeling, a sombre motion in a darkly lit tale, which really adds that extra belief and realism to its own vintage context.The setting of the Addam's mansion is beautifully executed by Sonnenfeld. The dark imagery and specialist field help make the Addam's crazier, such as casual sword fights, bizarre food choices and books that come to life.The use of two worlds is an extra bonus as we see many puns on day to day life. Having this style of comedy revolving around everyday life can be associated with audiences of all ages and adds another dimension to the fantasy. The slapstick comedy is also delicious, original and thankfully not repetitive.Though there is a slight convention in the plot, the dark imagination juxtaposed with the crazy characters makes the Addams Family a refreshingly interesting comedy.

This one is able to be a fantastically entertaining film while also being true to what it's first one set-up. The Monster this time around is around for much more time, allowing for some more interaction and a general feeling for the monster. Every amount of forest scenes look great, full of action and whimsy that very few have. The chases are also made fun to watch with a unique twist, which can't be spoiled but is indeed a great one at that. The rampages this time around also much more prominent in the earlier section, and give good reason why the forest scenes hold up the way they do. The best section is again the spectacular conclusion, which must've been an all-out extravaganza back then and still manages to get some great thrills out of it. The spectacle of it is what's really amazing, making it a full-on ride to the very end, and indeed the film rarely has any low points in the action. The film has a very upbeat pace during it's runtime, keeping things light and loose and then being blown away with it's spectacular finale.

Despite the care it takes to continue right off where the first one started, there's still a couple of small little inconsistencies with the two. The fact that the monster can understand complex direction is the biggest one. It was shown in the first one that he could only understand a few basic commands, while in this one he's clearly shown several times to understand and follow relatively more complex situations. As the time period between the two is not that great, it's a weird example to see that. The only other part that really sticks out is the opening flashback sequence. It's a really out of place part that doesn't have too much to add to the film other than giving it a pointless part. These are exceedingly minor grievances and aren't at all that distracting.The Final Verdict With only the most minor of grievances, this is a really entertaining film that manages to beat out it's predecessor and move into the realms of the all-time genre classics.
