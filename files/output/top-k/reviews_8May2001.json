It is about people in Alaska struggling to get through their day-to-day lives, some with dignity, some not so much.  They are all interesting and they all have their secrets and their stories.  Like any small town, everyone knows everyone else's problems.   The second half of the movie is about circumstances that leave Joe Gastineau, his new girlfriend, and her daughter stranded on a remote island and their struggle to survive.  I had trouble believing any of the action in the second half.  It starts going wrong when Joe brings the girls on his brother's boat without asking his brother if that was OK.  Then his brother does not object even though he knows it is going to be dangerous.   Later, the bad guys track down the boat, even though the boat is not where it is supposed to be due to a storm.  The bad guys are able to silently sneak up on and board the boat.  Joe and friends are able to swim away from and escape from the bad guys even though the bad guys have a motor boat and guns.  They struggle to survive on the remote island, but they always seem too clean, dry, shaved, and well fed.   The movie then has a cop-out ending, although I could not think of a better ending, given the incredible action that preceded it.The second half of the movie did not feel like a John Sayles movie.  It was like someone else wrote it.This movie has some great performances.  David Strathairn is a troubled, but good hearted handy-man.   Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is wonderful as a singer who is just barely keeping her life in order and raising a daughter.  She portrays someone who is cheerful and optimistic and at the same time someone who is weary and can see only more problems in the future.  She is getting older and has given up ever becoming a famous singer.  It is an interesting, appealing character.

It just followed a formula too closely for my liking.  The formula is A child from a poor ignorant family gets involved in an activity not usually associated with his socioeconomic class.  The family doesn't understand or approve so the activity is done on the sly.  A wise teacher recognizes the child's talent and encourages the activity.  The child has a chance to display his talent to someone of influence but a family crisis threatens to wreck the talented child's chances.  The ignorant parent becomes enlightened at the last moment and they hurriedly show up before the influential person who sees the child's talent and saves the day.  This movie has been made many times before.  There were no surprises in this retelling.  I felt some of the scenes were very contrived and didn't make sense given the scenes that preceded them.  There was a lack of emotional and character continuity.  Billy liked ballet but he wasn't gay.  That point was blatantly made.  Why?  Why couldn't he be gay?  That would have given the movie a twist.  Maybe the demographics of the prospective paying audience would not like the main character to be gay so he likes ballet but isn't gay.  A gay character was included to show how tolerant and understanding Billy could be but in another scene he is shown to be crude and brutal.  Also the demographics would dictate a rock music background so at a climatic moment the Swan Lake music is introduced but quickly replaced with some mediocre rock song.  It made no sense.  The cursing was also too much.   The movie was rated R because of it.  I would think the target audience would be families and younger people that the R rating would exclude.  If mature audiences were the target group why have such a bland sweet story.  A loss of a big audience just so you can say the eff word.  It makes no sense.

There's Keanu, the business man, straight, cruel, cold-blooded, very successful in what he's doing but -of course- very bad in enjoying a real life. Very bad at developing senses. Then, there's Charlize, who's the exact opposite. She knows everything about how to enjoy life, seize the day, 100% all the time. And -also of course- she's able to read Keanu's mind in no time, knows about his miserable back-stage life. Charlize meets Keanu and offers him to live with him! Why? Because she wants to help him. Keanu accepts and -surprise- the two fall in love. Don't worry, movie lover, I won't reveal the entire storyline although it is very predictable anyway.Concisely, -I think you could already feel the sarcastic touch- it's a bad movie and IMDb's average 5.6 really surprised me. I voted 4 out of ten. Only because Charlize manages again to deliver a solid performance as Sarah.

I remember the movie being very profane, dirty and extremely funny. It still is a funny film after all these years though I did notice a number of things in the movie that made it even more than just a funny sports movie.Nancy Dowd's very observant screenplay and George Roy Hill's sharp direction showed the trials and tribulations of being a minor league hockey player the long road trips, the drinking & partying, the competition against other teams that are going through the same lifestyle.(Arguably, writer\/director Ron Shelton did a slightly better job dealing with the same plot in a different minor league sports movie several years later Bull Durham.)The characters and the subplots still have me laughing out loud Dunlop putting a bounty on a competing player's head, the rug-wearing radio announcer (wonderfully played by Andrew Duncan), the French Canadian goaltender (Yvon Barrette) who makes Yogi Berra's malaprop statements sound grammatically correct, the underhanded general manager (the late, great Strother Martin), the unexpected striptease by the Chiefs leading scorer Ned Braden (Michael Ontkean) which catches many players, who were beating each other on the ice, totally off guard. I love the line by Ogle Oglethorpe (Ned Dowd, Nancy's brother) after beating up a Chief player and then seeing Braden taking his uniform off This is disgusting.... How about that for irony!I do have to admit that what still has me laughing but not as much as before was the overall homophobic atmosphere in the movie. To insult another player (or, most notably, the Chiefs absentee owner) is to call someone a derogatory name. Despite mentioning this observation, I still laughed out loud when Dunlop taunted a competing team's goaltender, among other names, a lesbian. As a hockey fan since the 1970s. I believe screenwriter Nancy Dowd was very accurate in depicting what goes on inside and outside the locker room. At the same time, when it comes to trash talking, and the possibility that the person on player may trash, might be gay (e.g. a character in Les Boys. For the record, I was not too impressed with the movie.), I wonder if Slap Shot is more dated that I first thought (bad fashion notwithstanding).The relationship between Reggie Dunlop and his still married but separated wife still sticks out to me as very bittersweet. Jennifer Warren's performance stood out for me when I first saw the movie and it's one of the many strong aspects of the movie. I got the feeling that as much as she loves Reggie, she was not a happy woman in the relationship.Paul Newman gave some great performances before (Hud, Cool Hand Luke, The Hustler) and after (The Verdict, Nobody's Fool, arguably, The Color of Money & Absence of Malice) Slap Shot. I certainly don't think it's his best work but I though he did a good job of what it was like to be an old man in a young man's sport.Note For legal reasons, a number of songs that appeared in the movie on the big screen and on cable TV do not appear on the U.S. home video version. They include Get Right Back Where We Started From by Maxine Nightingale, Elton John's Sorry Seems To Be the Hardest Word, Leo Sayer's You Make Me Feel Like Dancing, Fleetwood Mac's Rhiannon and a song called A Little Bit South of Saskatoon.

Despite the brilliance of its actors, of director Robert Zemeckis, and of certain powerful scenes, I find that the overall film itself is a cynical lie.  On the surface, `Gump' is a cheerful film about the perseverance of its genuinely sweet title character.  Under that sweetness, though is a disturbing, uncomfortable message that says daring to dream is a bad idea.For the seven people who haven't seen `Forrest Gump', the film deals with the travels and troubles of one Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks), an affable man with an IQ of 75 who manages to bounce around key historical events from 1950 onward in `Zelig'-like fashion.  Forrest inadvertently teaches Elvis to swivel his hips.  Forest accidentally becomes a football star.  Forest accidentally becomes a Vietnam war hero, then accidentally becomes a successful businessman.  (See a pattern?)  Throughout all his travels and misadventures, Forrest is forced to deal with adversity and hardship &#150; and he can never seem to fully capture the love of his childhood sweetheart Jenny (Robin Wright-Penn) &#150; but through sheer niceness and through blind faith in the goodness of others, Forrest invariably manages to push on through his difficulties and to triumph in life.Again, on the surface, a sweet, glowing, feel-good film.  Despite my own misgivings about the film, there's no doubt that Tom Hanks is simply awesome as Gump &#150; he clearly deserved the Oscar he won for the role. He gives Forrest Gump a childlike innocence, but there's more to it that that; there's a certain confidence that he exudes at all the right times, as well as insecurities at his low moments.  Forrest Gump is certainly far more complex than the simple figure he appears to be at first glance, and I can't think of any actor who could've played it better than Hanks.  Robin Wright-Penn is perfect as Jenny, who makes an astonishing journey through the years between wide-eyed to hardened cynicism to the acceptance and understanding of experience.  I'm surprised she wasn't nominated for an Oscar as well.  Gary Sinise makes a perfect counterpoint to Gump in the Vietnam era as Lieutenant Dan, another person who can't seem to travel through life quite as smoothly as Forrest does.  Combine this with a superbly paced film, with moments both funny and sorrowful (often at the same time), as well as some of the best, subtle uses of CGI effects ever put to celluloid, and `Forrest Gump' should be one of the best films of all time.  Right?In my opinion, no.  `Gump' is a bitter, bitter movie.  Look at Jenny's dreams and aspirations, how hard she works to attain them, and how little she actually accomplishes.  Ditto the dreams of Lieutenant Dan, or Gump's friend Bubba (Mykelti Williamson).  For them, their hopes never ultimately amount to anything, not without the `accidental' help of Forrest Gump, anyway.  Forrest, who has no ambitions, and never shows any true interest in doing anything, becomes wildly successful by doing nothing.  In essence, those who dare to dream in `Forrest Gump' are punished for their ambition, while those who do nothing are handsomely rewarded.  Considering that some of Jenny's dreams (and Lieutenant Dan's) are particularly selfish &#150; in fact, a few are downright noble &#150; I found this little understated message to be incredibly disturbing.  It bothered me enough to make me not like this film at all, despite all the wonderful moments it does contain.`Forrest Gump' gets an overall grade of a C+ -- it starts out as an `A', but its dark underlying cynicism drags it back down to that level.  But hey, I could be wrong.  It's simply the Mad Reviewer's opinion.  Good or bad, there's some great performances, and it's also thought-provoking.  Watch it for yourself, and let me know what you think.

Right?In my opinion, no.  `Gump' is a bitter, bitter movie.  Look at Jenny's dreams and aspirations, how hard she works to attain them, and how little she actually accomplishes.  Ditto the dreams of Lieutenant Dan, or Gump's friend Bubba (Mykelti Williamson).  For them, their hopes never ultimately amount to anything, not without the `accidental' help of Forrest Gump, anyway.  Forrest, who has no ambitions, and never shows any true interest in doing anything, becomes wildly successful by doing nothing.  In essence, those who dare to dream in `Forrest Gump' are punished for their ambition, while those who do nothing are handsomely rewarded.  Considering that some of Jenny's dreams (and Lieutenant Dan's) are particularly selfish &#150; in fact, a few are downright noble &#150; I found this little understated message to be incredibly disturbing.  It bothered me enough to make me not like this film at all, despite all the wonderful moments it does contain.`Forrest Gump' gets an overall grade of a C+ -- it starts out as an `A', but its dark underlying cynicism drags it back down to that level.  But hey, I could be wrong.  It's simply the Mad Reviewer's opinion.  Good or bad, there's some great performances, and it's also thought-provoking.

Despite the brilliance of its actors, of director Robert Zemeckis, and of certain powerful scenes, I find that the overall film itself is a cynical lie.  On the surface, `Gump' is a cheerful film about the perseverance of its genuinely sweet title character.  Under that sweetness, though is a disturbing, uncomfortable message that says daring to dream is a bad idea.For the seven people who haven't seen `Forrest Gump', the film deals with the travels and troubles of one Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks), an affable man with an IQ of 75 who manages to bounce around key historical events from 1950 onward in `Zelig'-like fashion.  Forrest inadvertently teaches Elvis to swivel his hips.  Forest accidentally becomes a football star.  Forest accidentally becomes a Vietnam war hero, then accidentally becomes a successful businessman.  (See a pattern?)  Throughout all his travels and misadventures, Forrest is forced to deal with adversity and hardship &#150; and he can never seem to fully capture the love of his childhood sweetheart Jenny (Robin Wright-Penn) &#150; but through sheer niceness and through blind faith in the goodness of others, Forrest invariably manages to push on through his difficulties and to triumph in life.Again, on the surface, a sweet, glowing, feel-good film.  Despite my own misgivings about the film, there's no doubt that Tom Hanks is simply awesome as Gump &#150; he clearly deserved the Oscar he won for the role. He gives Forrest Gump a childlike innocence, but there's more to it that that; there's a certain confidence that he exudes at all the right times, as well as insecurities at his low moments.  Forrest Gump is certainly far more complex than the simple figure he appears to be at first glance, and I can't think of any actor who could've played it better than Hanks.  Robin Wright-Penn is perfect as Jenny, who makes an astonishing journey through the years between wide-eyed to hardened cynicism to the acceptance and understanding of experience.  I'm surprised she wasn't nominated for an Oscar as well.  Gary Sinise makes a perfect counterpoint to Gump in the Vietnam era as Lieutenant Dan, another person who can't seem to travel through life quite as smoothly as Forrest does.

No, not awful, but a long way from a really good one. For a summer action\/adventure movie this one holds no surprises. Everything that is supposed to be a surprise can be seen coming too far off. I hate to ruin a movie for anybody, but trust me, you will know a major piece of how the movie will end in the first 30 minutes. It is practically waved under your nose. I think the people making this movie relied a little too heavily on our ability to suspend disbelief as well. Okay, I expect to have to just go along with several story devices in a movie like this, but don't push me too far. I can accept mummies that use martial arts (after all, I have to accept the whole Imhotep thing to even buy a ticket.) However, asking me to accept that a trip from London to Cairo only took two days in 1933 is too much.(Yes, I know that planes existed, but how do you transport the creature and his entire entourage so fast? It seems far more likely that trains and boats would be involved.) I am then asked to accept a rocket powered dirigible! And then this last device is stretched far beyond the breaking point. I'm sorry, but I think the script writers and the director could have worked just a little harder. I shouldn't have to work so hard to overlook so much just so I can enjoy a movie.
