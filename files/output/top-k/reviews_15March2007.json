Miss Congeniality is one of the movies that made Sandra Bullock what she is today, and with good reason- She's great! Yes, this is truly one of Ms. Bullock's finest moments. She is spot-on as a dirty Harriet of sorts; She's an FBI agent who is assigned to go undercover as a contestant in the Miss United States Pageant. Hilarity ensues. Not only does Ms. Bullock pull off the physical comedy wonderfully, she makes a real character out of a role that could have been very one-dimensional. She lets us actually get to know the character, which only makes the movie that much better. Truly, Ms. Bullock gives one of the greatest comedic performances of all time.And then there's the supporting cast! The supporting cast!!! They are all superb. One of the best casts put together in years. Candice Bergen and William Shatner create one of the greatest comedic tag teams of all time. Then there's Michael Caine. He is the other star of the show. He steals almost all the scenes he's in. What a great actor! Really, this is my example of a perfect comedy, and that's why I give it a 10. The cast is brilliant, the script hilarious.

But therein lies the biggest problem. Dungeons & Dragons is not just a novel or a video game, it is a canon unto itself with a wealth of material that gives the likes of Superman a good contest. And because of the nature of the game, every story in Dugeons & Dragons, even if it is not necessarily entertaining or compelling, has a certain depth that is absent from this film. A good example would be the Eye Of The Beholder games. Even at their worst, the story that drove the adventures was replete with twists and turns that would have made a great motion picture. Not having played the actual game myself, even though I own one of the handbooks, I did not have any specific expectations when going into this film adaptation. Other than a decent story and some passable acting, that is. So when the first five minutes of the film passed, I was dumbfounded. Utterly dumbfounded.Aside from the overly dramatic score music and poorly-written narration, the first thing you will gawk at in Dungeons & Dragons is Bruce Payne's bright blue lips. Believe me when I tell you that they are the least of the film's problems. No, the real problem becomes evident when Jeremy Irons, one of the best actors working today, walks in and overacts like he is trying to perform in the midst of a violent hypoglycaemic fit. Having had plenty of those, I am speaking from experience when I say that it is a more plausible explanation than any other offered for Irons' performance, save for director Courtney Solomon actually asking him to act this way. But it gets even worse from there. About seven minutes into the film, we get our first earful of Marlon Wayans as Snails, a Human Thief who sounds like he has been too enthusiastic with the anal probe and the helium. By the time he utters his tenth squeal, you will literally be wondering how a canon with creatures colloquially known as landsharks by the residents can suffer this kind of fool.About the only redeeming scene in the entire film comes when the aforementioned Payne throws Wayans off a high platform and thus kills Snails stone dead. This has given rise to a convention in all role-playing games where, at the death of a character one is meant to give a rat's bottom about but does not, one yells out Snails! in their highest, whiniest voice. It is for a good reason. There has never been a character in a film we have wanted to see die so badly. Even Jar Jar Binks had a redeeming moment when he helped give birth to the Empire. Unfortunately, Zoe McLellan and Justin Whalin soon follow this up with a political debate that looks more like a pair of whining children arguing about who is more entitled to the last chocolate bar. Unfortunately, this is not exactly a unique moment in the film, with Thora Birch presenting the heroic side of an argument about whether an absolute monarchy should be set aside in favour of democratic rule in a manner that really leaves her opposition without need to say a thing.There are a few reasons why I prefer this mess of a film to The Lord Of The Rings. Primary among them is that where I can draw unintentional comedy value from Dungeons & Dragons, Return Of The King so seriously believes it is high art that even its failure to notice that it reads like the result of only reading every tenth page of the novel is excruciating. I laughed at D&D. By the time LOTR finally rolled out its credits for the last time, I was crying. But comparisons to one of the worst film adaptations of a novel in history cannot save D&D from the fact that it is a stunning example that one should be careful what they wish for. For years, vocal fans of the game made it clear they wanted a film made by someone who was a fan of the game, as opposed to the suits, the accountants who really run Hollywood. Well, they got what they wanted, with director Courtney Solomon being a fan so determined to make the film according to the idea of D&D that he had in his head that even his own lack of ability as a director could not stop him.And that, in a nutshell, is what killed Dungeons & Dragons at the box office. It is one thing to take a film so seriously that no fun can be discerned from the story when it is needed. It is another entirely to treat the thing as a complete joke. Because nobody in the story is taking their part seriously, the entire deal fails to connect with the viewer on any level, which is a fatal error where fantasy stories are concerned. The traditional market for these kinds of stories has been dominated by intellects, or the kind of people who would be reading Heinlein if they were not reading these stories, so treating the genre in such a cheap fashion is not the way to engage your audience. Especially not when the material you are making a mess of has so much potential. A power struggle between the mages and everyone else in the realm is not an easy story idea to waste so utterly. One reviewer once wrote that making a film or game this bad out of nothing is an everyday event, but making a film or game so bad out of source material like this takes a special effort.Hence, Dungeons & Dragons gets a one out of ten from me. It is so bad one can watch it just to see how terrible films really get.

I'm not sure either if I agree with the idea that it's better to let go ten guilty rather than being wrong with an innocent. War, natural disaster and diseases take innocents all the time. And yes error is human and error takes a lot of lives in many fields. Thus as long as justice has done all and the best it can. I think I'd be happy with this. I'm comfortable with the ending even if I understand that it creates precedent. A time to kill, for me was not a waste of time.

Hoskins plays the part of the gumshoe perfectly, and his cartoonish movements and actions at the end of the film are superb. Lloyd has a field day. An actor who very few would ever accuse of being unafraid to go over the top, here he gets to actually play a live action cartoon, and every moment he is on screen is wonderful. Joanna Cassidy, as Hoskins' love interest Doloris is also fantastic, getting to play the kind of smart talking character made so famous by Mae West all those years ago.Yet the real stars all all of the characters we love from our childhood.

Savini has used his experience as a war correspondent to create some of the most realistic looking effects ever put to film. From scalping's to stabbings to a shotgun blast to the head, Savini owns this film with his mondo gore. Joe Spinell is okay as psycho Frank Zito but Caroline Munro is wasted in her role as his love interest Anna. Zito talks to himself nonstop, lending the position of schizophrenia to his character and he murders out of a guilt complex. He kills and then scalps women who remind him of his abusive mother and then nails the scalps to mannequins. Many call the film misogynistic since many of the victims are women, but the fact is that Zito does kill a couple of men along the way as well.

The man has directed two of my favorite films, Dr. Strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb and Paths of Glory. So I took it upon myself to watch another one of his that I haven't seen yet. Full Metal Jacket is both a funny and disturbing look at the effect of the military on those that serve in it, at least, as far as I can tell.One thing that I always particularly liked about Kubrick films is they have a wonderful grasp of black humor. Kubrick's direction is always so cold and controlled so that we're always just observing moments. When the funny hits, he doesn't do anything to indicate the funny, but rather coolly and dryly observes the absurdity of the moment therein. You can see this frequently in the training sequences where we observe the soldiers repeating the absolutely ridiculous rhetoric of their drill sergeant as though it were nothing. Another way that Kubrick likes to throw in humor in this piece is his often clashing use of old pop songs, which are placed up front in the mix so that they're loud and clear. The songs are clearly non-diegetic since there is often no place for the music to be coming from and the mix indicates it and yet somehow, even though the songs often don't fit lyrically, creating an effect that somewhat distances us from the image, somehow they also all fit together with the image such that you can't actually imagine the film without the music.The sound mix on the film is also fantastic. It's not fully immersive there's some element of the mixing that, like the music and the coldly observant camera, that leaves us a little detached from the film, creating a little reflexive space. It works so well with the rest of the elements of the film. It's strange because you'd think the distance created by Kubrick's overall direction would cause you to feel detached from the film, but it actually doesn't... we just watch everything a little differently. The one time that the film's music becomes diegetic is when the soldiers march on after a horrible incident--singing the Mickey Mouse show theme song. Again, a wild contrast of innocence in a place of horror.I praise the direction, but I can't do the same for the story. It's a bit of a wandering mess. First of all, the structure of the film is basically two separate stories joined together by shared characters. The first half of the film deals with the recruits and their training under a straight-faced angry and somewhat unhinged drill sergeant. We watch as the new recruits are stripped of their individuality and become real Marines. There's a real drama in the relationship of the drill sergeant, Joker and Gomer Pyle, but the story doesn't really seem to go anywhere. When all was said and done with the first half, I just stopped and had to wonder, So? The second half deals with the Marines in Vietnam. Here we see the military interact with the local populace, including some disturbing moments where the Marines treat the Vietnamese as sub-human. But because of Kubrick's direction, we actually don't side with them but just watch them and find ourselves in horror. You can see this a little in the Marines' interactions with the prostitutes as well. The fact that everybody finds it okay to bargain over how much a sex act costs and the relative ease of soldiers all sharing the same prostitute draws up a little recoil, at least in me. We also see slices of the hell of war, as people die unexpectedly. Again, many of the deaths are shown without dramatic effect, until near the end. As authority figures die, it's done without any of the expected slow-motion glory-deaths, but rather matter-of-factly. It gets really eerie near the end though, when a Vietcong sniper lies dying and the Marines are observing her. Suddenly, Kubrick steps into the picture and makes us think about the Marines and their enemies by lingering in the moment of her suffering, after she had killed a number of Marines.But for all the moments that the film puts together so well, it still leaves you with a bit of so what? Kubrick observes a lot in this film, but it's hard to find his voice. This might be true of many of Kubrick's films, but it makes me wonder what I'm supposed to take from what I see. Full Metal Jacket, then, to me, is more about the story of the dehumanizing nature of both the military and the war. Joker, our protagonist, stands as our human character, who struggles to stay human in such awful conditions. At the same time, in the end, was there a lesson to be learned? Or are we all just supposed to sigh and continue on like we can't help ourselves? Or maybe that's what we were supposed to think all along? Either way, I found Full Metal Jacket to be quite impressive, even with all of its flaws. There's a lot in it. Good stuff. 8\/10.

But I can say that this was the least entertaining of the four so far. Not the worst, because it wasn't all bad.My favorite scene is the birthday party for Uncle Paulie. I like the warm family moments, especially when they are funny. And I like that robot that Rocky gives Uncle Paulie as a present. And I like Uncle Paulie and Rocky's son. Adrian is quite pretty. The actors playing all three do a good job.In second place, although I don't like boxing (which is why I've taken so long to see these movies), is watching Rocky persevere against Drago. I can't stand watching the guy get beat up so badly. How can anyone take so much punishment and still keep fighting? And yet he does. It's a pleasure to see him actually wear down Drago.Sylvester Stallone gives a good performance overall here. Sure, this isn't a classic, but it's not terrible. Carl Weathers is even better, though to me his reaction to Drago is overdone (part of that is writing). And certainly what happened to Apollo in the ring was too much. But it does give Rocky an incentive.Brigitte Nielsen and Michael Pataki give good performances as well. As for Dolph Lundgren, he does an amazing job of just looking tough and fierce, but for the most part Drago shows no emotion. In one exciting sequence where he and Rocky are both shown training in separate locations, he does show some determination. And toward the end of his fight with Rocky, Drago no longer appears to be a robot. I wouldn't call that good acting, though.For those who started with this movie, that would be unfortunate because you're not seeing how good the others are. But there are flashbacks at one point, with music but no sound, to help explain what has happened.The music in this movie is certainly not my taste. The familiar theme from the first two movies is not in it, to my knowledge, though the Survivor theme from the third movie is pretty good. Most of the rest of the songs, as opposed to background music, sound like garbage to me. James Brown's performance in the typical Vegas introduction to the first fight shows He's still got it as of the making of this movie, but it's still not the sort of thing I like. Wayne Newton, Frank Sinatra, or any number of Vegas-style musicians would have pleased me more.There is some beautiful scenery in Russia (actually Canada).Anyway, if you enjoyed the other movies, you might consider this a letdown, or you might enjoy this more because some of what made the others good is here.

Carl Weathers is even better, though to me his reaction to Drago is overdone (part of that is writing). And certainly what happened to Apollo in the ring was too much.

I wouldn't call that good acting, though.For those who started with this movie, that would be unfortunate because you're not seeing how good the others are.

The familiar theme from the first two movies is not in it, to my knowledge, though the Survivor theme from the third movie is pretty good. Most of the rest of the songs, as opposed to background music, sound like garbage to me.

Wayne Newton, Frank Sinatra, or any number of Vegas-style musicians would have pleased me more.There is some beautiful scenery in Russia (actually Canada).Anyway, if you enjoyed the other movies, you might consider this a letdown, or you might enjoy this more because some of what made the others good is here.

I submit to you that this is because most of us just don't get it.I'll use the plot portent to tell you what this movie isn't, first of all. Despite appearances, it's not about up-and-coming, wannabe yuppie Walter Davis (Bruce Willis), not really about his blind date of the title with the beautiful and potentially deadly Nadia Gates (Kim Basinger), not about psychotic defense lawyer and jealous ex David Bedford's (John Laroquette) attempts to break the two up and steal back his first love, and not about the punches and rolls with which these people, along with their families and acquaintances, must deal.It's just my theory, but I think most of us didn't get this movie because it was a humorous commentary on the time during which it was made. This movie is all about the '80s; the yuppie culture, the self-absorption, the repeated attempts of folks to find solace in getting and having things, and our near-tragic couple's struggle to be who they are, even if it doesn't fit with '80s yuppie culture, and embrace what's important. Consider it--during her drunken binge, Nadia assaults everything that could make Walter a yuppie as if it were a well-organized plan. Walter, in turn, tries his hand at the same thing, mostly upon David and car salesman brother Ted (late, great Phil Hartman). Sure the details give a chuckle or two, but there's an almost cerebral humor going on under the surface of the film, right at the core, which pokes fun at a cornerstone of life in the '80s.This led to the movie's downfall in favor, since the very people at which the movie so heavily pokes fun were probably among the first ones to see it premiere in the '80s. Even if they got it, they probably didn't appreciate the joke. Essemtially, Edwards had spoofed the '80s DURING the '80s. A gutsy move, and witting or unwitting, this gave it a kind of staying power.

Enter Timothy Dalton and The Living Daylights. What a breath of fresh air! With Dalton, Bond was changed from a smarmy, one-line spewing 00 agent without the physical presence to any longer play the role into a more serious, mysterious, and athletic figure. Dalton's Bond may come out with a clever line here and there, but he's far form the ridiculous quip machine that Moore had become. And to top it off, The Living Daylights sees Bond returning somewhat to his roots and actually doing a little spy work. Imagine that &#150; Bond as a spy! The Living Daylights isn't the perfect Bond film. Neither General Koskov (Jeroen Krabbe) nor Brad Whitaker (Joe Don Baker) make for very threatening Bond villains. They come off more as clowns than men to be feared. Also, even though I enjoy Maryam d'Abo's work in the movie, her Kara Milovy is a little too helpless as written. But any weaknesses I see in The Living Daylights are more than offset by the movie's strong points. Some of the various set-pieces are wonderful. I'm particularly fond of the clever method used to get Koskov into the west. And that final fight scene in the airplane is one of the best found in any of the Bond movies. The plot is interesting and just complicated enough to keep you guessing throughout The Living Daylights. Just when you think you've got things figured out, the plot throws another curve ball. Most of the acting is excellent. Even though it was Dalton's first time in the role, I think he nails it. John Rhys-Davis, in a much too small of a role, and Art Malik really standout and deliver a couple of nice performances. As should be evident, the positives easily outweigh the negatives as far as I'm concerned.I'm one of those who hate the fact that Dalton was only given the opportunity to play James Bond twice.

So, as you can imagine, on TV it was in hideous pan and scan and with several scenes missing. In reality, I have never seen the 'full' movie until now. And I have to admit, it's far, far superior to Bryan Singer's self-indulgent mess of Superman Returns.It actually takes quite a while to get going, but there's so much going on that the running time certainly doesn't seem two and a half hours. Richard Donner shot it back to back with Superman II, so there's an extended opening act that establishes the plot of the sequel at the same time.Anyone who doesn't know the story of Superman must be from another galaxy, but for those people I will give you a quick soundbite. Kal El is the orphan of the planet Krypton, which has recently blown up. He comes to Earth as a baby and lands in Smallville where he is quickly adopted by a farmer and his wife and renamed Clark Kent. His dense molecular structure and his ability to defy Earth's gravity give him advantages over humans and ultimately he becomes...SUPERMAN! But who doesn't already know that? Clark Kent assumes an exaggerated, clumsy, meek newspaper reporter persona to distance himself from the Superman guise. Somehow everybody, including secret love Lois Lane, falls for it even though the glasses and the hair are all that is different. Hypervillain Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) doesn't take well to the man of steel as he might interfere with his plans for Real Estate Domination (the modern term for World Domination). But does he really think he can win? Hypervillains never know when to be humble.Just about everything that was terrible about Superman Returns is completely right about this one. The cinematography, the music, the editing, the pacing. I won't call the SFX fake, since it doesn't ever take you out of the film, so I'll just call them 'quaint'. For 1978 they're good and even though they are all done optically it's still better than the CGI crapfest of Singer's interpretation.Christopher Reeve's ultimate fate does kind of upset me, so it's good to see him in his prime and being made immortal in a way. The cast of this film does have a lot of big names. Along with the huge scope and spectacle, such a large cast adds to the epic feel of it. Marlon Brando, Gene Hackman, Ned Beatty, Margot Kidder, Terence Stamp and Glenn Ford just seem like a far more dynamic bunch of actors than Kate Bosworth and Kal Penn. Don't you think? It's been 29 years since this film was released and people still make a big fuss over it today. In 29 years, will be still be talking about Superman Returns? Outside of ridicule, I think not.

So, as you can imagine, on TV it was in hideous pan and scan and with several scenes missing. In reality, I have never seen the 'full' movie until now.

Richard Donner shot it back to back with Superman II, so there's an extended opening act that establishes the plot of the sequel at the same time.Anyone who doesn't know the story of Superman must be from another galaxy, but for those people I will give you a quick soundbite. Kal El is the orphan of the planet Krypton, which has recently blown up. He comes to Earth as a baby and lands in Smallville where he is quickly adopted by a farmer and his wife and renamed Clark Kent. His dense molecular structure and his ability to defy Earth's gravity give him advantages over humans and ultimately he becomes...SUPERMAN! But who doesn't already know that?
