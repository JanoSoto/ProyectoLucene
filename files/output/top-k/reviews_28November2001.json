The problem is that Kubrick never gives us much hint that his films are a whole different beast than the others on the shelf at the video store. I think he relished the confusion.Most films tell a story in the old fashioned way time moves, things happen, characters act. In these films, the story is largely apart from the storytelling. Because film is different than everything else, the means of storytelling are unique to film. And because film is still new, we have lots of room for discovering how to tell a story.So we have the vast majority of filmmakers and viewers who think of a film purely in terms of the story. But we have another group of people who watch the storytelling, and perhaps (like myself) don't demand that much from the story itself. That's why we admire empty stylists like De Palma, but of course prefer master visual storytellers like Kurosawa.The holy grail is when the narrative of the conventional threads and the cinematic ones mesh, or are coordinated in some clever way. By cinematic threads, I mean a narrative invested in the very fabric of the camera, like `Marienbad,' like `Pillow Book,' like Welles' `Othello,' or with the aid of actors like `Sweet and Lowdown,' or `Vanya on 42nd Street.' There's a sublime joy to parallel immersion in both the story and cinematic narratives.But sometimes along comes a Kubrick to confound us. I spent a lot of time with `Eyes Wide Shut' before understanding it, because I was looking for the tie with the story. But Kubrick has the equation the other way around.

Jarmusch, Malick, and Kar-wai Wong (`In the Mood for Love') have this same attitude, with minor twists.Freed from limiting expectations, I am now able to enjoy `Barry Lyndon' in more the way I think Kubrick saw it.

After reading some reviews on other web sites, I was surprised to see that so many people (mostly Americans) actually liked the film.  And that they liked what Ralph and Uma did with the characters.  I am an American, and although I have only seen seasons 4 through 6 (peel and king), I consider myself to be one of the more dedicated fans of the show. I went and saw it on the day it was released, and was thoroughly disappointed.  Almost to the point of believing that there may have been a conspiracy to make this such a bad film.  I must admit that I was expecting to be disappointed - I was sure that the actors would not do well by the characters, judging especially from the utterly unsubtle publicity photos of Uma Peel.  I had hoped, however, that the overall production would have made it semi-enjoyable.  It was not.  Not only did the characters have no chemistry, but the whole flow of the movie was awkward and somewhat boring.The main fault for that, I would say, lies with the extreme over-editing of the film.  I had read the book that was written from the original script, so I could see what was cut.  In the movie, they trimmed parts of important scenes that made them incongruous or just fall flat.  I think one of the best examples of this is in one of the opening scenes when Steed is walking down a street fending off various surprise attackers, which is actually a test of his abilities, and is given a score of 9 (supposedly out of 10).  Nothing is further said or explained.  So why even show the score?  What they cut was additional attackers on the street with chains and Steed fought them off skillfully with his sword umbrella.  He didn't dispose of them instantly like the other attackers, however.  When Steed sees his score, he protests and is told that he took too long with the chain gang.  That extra little bit would have made that scene much better, but instead viewers are left to wonder why Steed got a score of 9.  There are many instances of this throughout the film.  The film was trimmed to a paltry 90 minutes.  I know they filmed a scene with the evil duplicate destroying the Prospero lab (there were publicity photos from those scenes), but it was cut in its entirety.  This would have been a much better setup and introduction to the whole plot.  If only they had not cut so much throughout, the plot would have flowed better and been a much more enjoyable film.As far as the characterizations, I will say that I was less disappointed with Uma Thurman as Mrs. Peel than I was with Ralph Fiennes as John Steed.  Sir August was okay, but his development was limited.  Nothing is explained about his obsession with Mrs. Peel.  John Steed was not presented as the perfect English gentleman in this picture.  A gentleman would NOT request that a strange woman whom he has never met to meet him in a gentleman's club where he is completely naked!  There are a few other examples of his absolutely rude behavior which I will decline to mention.  Uma peel was not too bad, but her portrayal was not as strong or as focused as Diana Rigg.  The fact that they were not paired up as partners and friends, but rather as a makeshift team trying to prove her innocence, did not do much for the pairs chemistry.  Steed even told her once that he was under orders to kill her if she was indeed a traitor.  Where he got those orders was edited out of the film, of course.  Also, it seems to me that the producers idea of how to make the two seem sophisticated was to have them drink gallons of tea.Because they cut it from the opening scene, we never see Steed's sword umbrella until the final fight scene with Sir August.  In the movie, Emma Peel fights much less than Steed, who is actually presented as a very skilled and trained fighter.  In the original series, it was Emma who had all the cool fight scenes and steed usually got by with clever and dirty tricks (like the steel plated bowler)  It seemed wrong not to see Emma delivering her trademark Karate chops.I will say that the amount of explosive action and special effects were adequate. The Avengers has never been about that kind of thing, anyway.  The Avengers is supposed to appeal to the brain as much as the eyes, so I'm glad it wasn't over done.One last production note the opening and closing credits, for which the original series was greatly loved, were absolutely abominable in the movie.  They looked like the opening of a James Bond film with a bad hangover!  They were a series of creepy and ugly visual distortions set to even creepier music.  The traditional music didn't appear until later in the film, and then only briefly.Don't let this film spoil your appreciation for one of the best TV shows  of all time.  Go watch the original series on video.

In the original series, it was Emma who had all the cool fight scenes and steed usually got by with clever and dirty tricks (like the steel plated bowler)  It seemed wrong not to see Emma delivering her trademark Karate chops.I will say that the amount of explosive action and special effects were adequate. The Avengers has never been about that kind of thing, anyway.  The Avengers is supposed to appeal to the brain as much as the eyes, so I'm glad it wasn't over done.One last production note the opening and closing credits, for which the original series was greatly loved, were absolutely abominable in the movie.  They looked like the opening of a James Bond film with a bad hangover!  They were a series of creepy and ugly visual distortions set to even creepier music.  The traditional music didn't appear until later in the film, and then only briefly.Don't let this film spoil your appreciation for one of the best TV shows  of all time.

After reading some reviews on other web sites, I was surprised to see that so many people (mostly Americans) actually liked the film.  And that they liked what Ralph and Uma did with the characters.  I am an American, and although I have only seen seasons 4 through 6 (peel and king), I consider myself to be one of the more dedicated fans of the show. I went and saw it on the day it was released, and was thoroughly disappointed.  Almost to the point of believing that there may have been a conspiracy to make this such a bad film.  I must admit that I was expecting to be disappointed - I was sure that the actors would not do well by the characters, judging especially from the utterly unsubtle publicity photos of Uma Peel.  I had hoped, however, that the overall production would have made it semi-enjoyable.  It was not.  Not only did the characters have no chemistry, but the whole flow of the movie was awkward and somewhat boring.The main fault for that, I would say, lies with the extreme over-editing of the film.  I had read the book that was written from the original script, so I could see what was cut.  In the movie, they trimmed parts of important scenes that made them incongruous or just fall flat.  I think one of the best examples of this is in one of the opening scenes when Steed is walking down a street fending off various surprise attackers, which is actually a test of his abilities, and is given a score of 9 (supposedly out of 10).  Nothing is further said or explained.  So why even show the score?  What they cut was additional attackers on the street with chains and Steed fought them off skillfully with his sword umbrella.  He didn't dispose of them instantly like the other attackers, however.  When Steed sees his score, he protests and is told that he took too long with the chain gang.  That extra little bit would have made that scene much better, but instead viewers are left to wonder why Steed got a score of 9.  There are many instances of this throughout the film.  The film was trimmed to a paltry 90 minutes.  I know they filmed a scene with the evil duplicate destroying the Prospero lab (there were publicity photos from those scenes), but it was cut in its entirety.  This would have been a much better setup and introduction to the whole plot.  If only they had not cut so much throughout, the plot would have flowed better and been a much more enjoyable film.As far as the characterizations, I will say that I was less disappointed with Uma Thurman as Mrs. Peel than I was with Ralph Fiennes as John Steed.  Sir August was okay, but his development was limited.  Nothing is explained about his obsession with Mrs. Peel.  John Steed was not presented as the perfect English gentleman in this picture.  A gentleman would NOT request that a strange woman whom he has never met to meet him in a gentleman's club where he is completely naked!  There are a few other examples of his absolutely rude behavior which I will decline to mention.  Uma peel was not too bad, but her portrayal was not as strong or as focused as Diana Rigg.  The fact that they were not paired up as partners and friends, but rather as a makeshift team trying to prove her innocence, did not do much for the pairs chemistry.  Steed even told her once that he was under orders to kill her if she was indeed a traitor.  Where he got those orders was edited out of the film, of course.  Also, it seems to me that the producers idea of how to make the two seem sophisticated was to have them drink gallons of tea.Because they cut it from the opening scene, we never see Steed's sword umbrella until the final fight scene with Sir August.
