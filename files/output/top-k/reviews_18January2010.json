It's the story of an iguanodon named Aladar (voiced by D.B. Sweeney) who, when he and his lemur family, Plio (voiced by Alfre Woodard), Zini (voiced by Max Cassela), Yar (voiced by Ossie Davis), and Suri (voiced by Hayden Panettiere) were almost extinct from an eye-popping meteor shower, they follow a herd of the remaining dinosaurs lead by the stubborn and unreasonable Kron (voiced by Samuel Wright). Along the way they'll befriend a feisty triceratops named Eema (voiced by Della Reese), a courageous brachiosaur named Baylene (voiced by Joan Plowright), a carefree stegosaurus named Url, and an iguanodon named Neera; they'll also dodge blood-thirsty carnotaurs on their voyage to the nesting grounds. This movie has just about everything great story, great characters, action-packed climax, suspense, stunning, unbelievable graphics, and a great film score composed by James Newton Howard. I recommend this to anyone who loves dinosaurs, a fan of Disney, or looking for a movie to watch with the whole family.

The bum agrees to do it but the reporter in Fletch takes over and he tries to figure out who this guy is and what his plan is. I had heard a lot of good things about this film over the years and I'm really not sure why it took me so long to check it out but I'm certainly glad I did as I can see myself revisiting this film every so often. The screenplay by future director Andrew Bergman is pretty straight-forward, simple and I'm sure followed the novel pretty well but the real key to this film is Chase and his masterful character of Chase. I always try to say there's no movie without a good screenplay but there are exceptions to the rules and I think this is the case because I seriously doubt a lot of what we're seeing was actually on the page and I'm fairly positive it's all coming from Chase's wacky mind. The mannerisms are one of the best things in the film as Chase is constantly getting into one mess after another and many of the best laughs don't come from dialogue but instead his reactions to what is going on. Whether he's getting busted for charging food to someone elses account or having police chase him, old Chase does a masterful job just reacting to everything and this delivers so many laughs throughout the film. We also get countless situations where Chase has to act out as different characters and once again he handles this masterfully and never misses a touch. Ritchie's direction is also very good because it really never feels like you're watching a movie. Instead, it really seems like you're just following Fletch around on this journey and the film runs so smoothly that you'll feel as if you're watching a documentary of the events or just watching them live. How the film constantly cuts to the next sequence of events comes off so fresh that you can't help but enjoy the ride and be excited for what's going to come next. Matheson is as fun as usual and we get nice supporting work from Joe Don Baker, M. Emmet Walsh, George Wendt and a young Geena Davis. Dana Wheeler-Nicholson is extremely charming as the love interest. Outside the bad 80s soundtrack, this film has enough laughs for two movies and it's the perfect example of how great Chase could be.

It's a movie about a bunch of drug addicts (one character is not knowingly a drug addict, but I'll get to that later). How do you think it's going to end up?! Either they sober up or go through a downward spiral, and the director chose the latter for all the characters to make you just think that Drugs are bad, mmmkay?Second of all, it's not realistic at all. So many places to start. I'll just break it down. 1) The 2 guys, on a drug-induced whim, make the decision to become dealers. And somehow these 2 (I repeat, 2) people rise up the complicated ladder of heroin trafficking, making tons of money in the process, making it look like a cakewalk, without the director showing any insight into what exactly they're doing other than a few 2-second clips of them standing on a street corner. That's just lazyness on the director's part in my opinion. To anyone who knows even the slightest about dealing drugs (not saying that I do), making it big is not an easy feat that 2 junkies can just start up.2) The older lady on diet pills. Presumably these contained methamphetamines. It does not make sense that she's just permanently crazy from taking them. Sure, you get methamphetamine toxicity from overdose, causing hallucinations and psychosis, but this would have been corrected in the hospital after withdrawing the meth and giving Haldol. She was not on them nearly long enough to suffer any permanent effects, the existence of which are even questionable. Regardless, Etc (Electroconvulsive therapy) would NOT be used for this. And even if they did use it, the patient would sedated, not wide awake. The director just threw this in for shock value.3) The guy being sent to jail for his arm infection. This is illegal. A physician cannot deny someone medical care just because they suspect a criminal act. Even a serial killer who goes on a rampage and then tries to kill himself but fails will go to a hospital for treatment (with security present) prior to going to jail. And even if they do suspect a criminal act, it's a violation of HIPAA for the physician to just tell the police unless the patient is an actual threat to himself or others. There is tons of medical literature about IV drug users... they are a unique and special patient population that have their own needs. I gotta say the director really makes doctors look like a-holes.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"18 January 2010","score":"24 out of 39 people found the following review useful","review":" This is one of those films that everybody talks about as being so disturbing and shocking... well I finally saw it and I think it's neither.First of all, it's utterly predictable. It's a movie about a bunch of drug addicts (one character is not knowingly a drug addict, but I'll get to that later). How do you think it's going to end up?! Either they sober up or go through a downward spiral, and the director chose the latter for all the characters to make you just think that Drugs are bad, mmmkay?Second of all, it's not realistic at all. So many places to start. I'll just break it down. 1) The 2 guys, on a drug-induced whim, make the decision to become dealers. And somehow these 2 (I repeat, 2) people rise up the complicated ladder of heroin trafficking, making tons of money in the process, making it look like a cakewalk, without the director showing any insight into what exactly they're doing other than a few 2-second clips of them standing on a street corner. That's just lazyness on the director's part in my opinion. To anyone who knows even the slightest about dealing drugs (not saying that I do), making it big is not an easy feat that 2 junkies can just start up.2) The older lady on diet pills. Presumably these contained methamphetamines. It does not make sense that she's just permanently crazy from taking them. Sure, you get methamphetamine toxicity from overdose, causing hallucinations and psychosis, but this would have been corrected in the hospital after withdrawing the meth and giving Haldol. She was not on them nearly long enough to suffer any permanent effects, the existence of which are even questionable. Regardless, Etc (Electroconvulsive therapy) would NOT be used for this. And even if they did use it, the patient would sedated, not wide awake. The director just threw this in for shock value.3) The guy being sent to jail for his arm infection. This is illegal. A physician cannot deny someone medical care just because they suspect a criminal act. Even a serial killer who goes on a rampage and then tries to kill himself but fails will go to a hospital for treatment (with security present) prior to going to jail. And even if they do suspect a criminal act, it's a violation of HIPAA for the physician to just tell the police unless the patient is an actual threat to himself or others. There is tons of medical literature about IV drug users... they are a unique and special patient population that have their own needs. I gotta say the director really makes doctors look like a-holes. And the sad thing is, some poor junkie out there probably saw this movie and thought There's no way I'm going to the hospital if my arm looks likes that!4) Pupils constrict with heroin, they don't dilate like the film shows.As for the shock value, what exactly is so disturbing and shocking about this movie? The orgy\/sex scene? First of all, you can find more shocking things on the internet. Second of all, I don't feel bad for Jeniffer Connely's character because despite how addicted to drugs she was, she still willingly CHOSE to go the dudes house and later the party.

Well that didn't work, as he barely escapes and finding himself floating down a river to be rescued by some old hermit who looks after him for a year to bring him back to health.

Dr. Loomis sees this in Jamie and tries everything to get her to use it so he can finally destroy Michael Myers. Halloween 5 The Revenge of Michael Myers was one of the sequels that I wasn't to fond of when first watched it, but after continuous repeat viewings its slightly growing on me, nonetheless still it's not without its problems in what is an unsatisfying exercise. While a little more grittier being very misogynistic and graphic (which the previous sequel wasn't) with its deaths, it's run-of-the-mill formula fell on the dull, lumpy side with it being less punctuated with grinding suspense and moody atmosphere (as some of it takes place in full daylight) concentrating on visceral unpleasantness and plastered jump scares. This low-budget production feels like a rushed job, and the misguided, wishy washy script just doesn't cut it even with a decent concept for its basis and a few unsettling surprises that caught me off guard. However there are some odd out of character moments involving Michael (toying with his victims, driving after them in what I guess beats slowly walking after them and showing a glimpse of emotion is just to name a few), useless comic routine police officers with ridiculous sound effects backing them up and a cloudy inclusion of a man dressed in black that seems to be following Michael around. The performances are simply mediocre, however the like of Danielle Harris radiates again and Ellie Cornell proves how much of a bold talent she is with a terrifically wholesome turn. Donald Pleasance looks ragged, but he passionately camps it up (with some morbid streaks) to show the obsessive strangle hold Myers has over Loomis' personally and mentally. As now he would do anything to get his man, even risking the life of Jamie to do so. Outside these three, there's not much else. I didn't find the teens here as agreeably likable. Dominique Othenin-Girard's direction is competent, but generically flat with little visual styling (which was an imprint of Return) and few intensity filled pockets of shocks, which you only wished it could hold it throughout. Still Michael is used unnervingly as a foreshadow within the background of many shots and it always seems to work as he could be lurking anywhere.

Now it's close to Halloween again, Michael awakes to pay him back for his troubles. Myers gets back to his brutal business and heads back to Haddonfield with the intention of killing his niece Jamie. After the horrific ordeal of stabbing her step-mother, she's now at a children's hospital and left with the inability to speak but somehow shares a telepathic link with her uncle to know when he would kill. Dr. Loomis sees this in Jamie and tries everything to get her to use it so he can finally destroy Michael Myers. Halloween 5 The Revenge of Michael Myers was one of the sequels that I wasn't to fond of when first watched it, but after continuous repeat viewings its slightly growing on me, nonetheless still it's not without its problems in what is an unsatisfying exercise. While a little more grittier being very misogynistic and graphic (which the previous sequel wasn't) with its deaths, it's run-of-the-mill formula fell on the dull, lumpy side with it being less punctuated with grinding suspense and moody atmosphere (as some of it takes place in full daylight) concentrating on visceral unpleasantness and plastered jump scares. This low-budget production feels like a rushed job, and the misguided, wishy washy script just doesn't cut it even with a decent concept for its basis and a few unsettling surprises that caught me off guard. However there are some odd out of character moments involving Michael (toying with his victims, driving after them in what I guess beats slowly walking after them and showing a glimpse of emotion is just to name a few), useless comic routine police officers with ridiculous sound effects backing them up and a cloudy inclusion of a man dressed in black that seems to be following Michael around. The performances are simply mediocre, however the like of Danielle Harris radiates again and Ellie Cornell proves how much of a bold talent she is with a terrifically wholesome turn. Donald Pleasance looks ragged, but he passionately camps it up (with some morbid streaks) to show the obsessive strangle hold Myers has over Loomis' personally and mentally. As now he would do anything to get his man, even risking the life of Jamie to do so. Outside these three, there's not much else. I didn't find the teens here as agreeably likable. Dominique Othenin-Girard's direction is competent, but generically flat with little visual styling (which was an imprint of Return) and few intensity filled pockets of shocks, which you only wished it could hold it throughout. Still Michael is used unnervingly as a foreshadow within the background of many shots and it always seems to work as he could be lurking anywhere. Also the creative novelty of the film's opening credits is a nice touch. It's more of the same, but an watchable pedestrian slasher blanketed with shocks.

The only one who can stop Freddy is his dead mother, but can Alice free her spirit in time to save her own son?.This movie did start of really well as we see Alice dreaming of being Amanda Kruger, who get stuck in the room and get raped by 100 Manics, then she being rushed to hospital but then she no longer the pregnant lady,,then she see Amanda giving birth to Freddy again.Alice and Dan are the only two people to return from the 4th movie and then have gotten some new Friends itsnot long before, Freddy start to kill again, I did like the first death, it was okay, not as good as the other deaths or dreams.Freddy himself didn't seem to be Scary in this, the nightmare were just boring, they were not scary or creepy at all.Acting in movies was okay for a 5th movie in the series but overall I think this movie was really Dull.

That said, the latter is superior, but not for the former's lack of trying. The backstory of Spartacus explains a lot Executive producer and star Kirk Douglas fires director Anthony Mann and brings in his Paths of Glory (a phenomenal film) director Stanley Kubrick. Problem is, the eventually infamous Kubrick really had no experience working with anyone's work but his own, even if the script was written by blacklisted two-time Oscar winner Dalton Trumbo. Basically, Douglas did his best to make the most of Spartacus, including the corralling of a distinguished cast, but it results in a very good -- not great -- film.For one, Trumbo's script is a crowd-pleaser, and I say that implying that it was for the '60s. Rarely does a war epic focus so heavily on the protagonist's romantic interest. As impressive as Jean Simmons is as Spartacus' lover and wife, Varinia, the subplot of these two slaves falling for each other has too much clout in a story that should focus sternly on Spartacus as the inspiring leader of a slave rebellion against the Roman empire. His love for Varinia ultimately makes him more likable, but it comes at the cost of part of the film's thematic boldness.Sadly, one of the scenes that was most interesting was not part of the film until it was remastered in 1991. In it, Laurence Olivier, playing powerful Senate leader Crassus, tries to seduce a young slave played by Tony Curtis as they are in the bath using a cunning metaphor. Naturally, this was deemed inappropriate by the Legion of Decency. Few scenes are as memorable as that one and only a couple of Spartacus' speeches on freedom are standouts as well. Death is the only a freedom a slave knows. That's why he's not afraid of it is one of just a handful of powerful moments in three-hour film.For Kubrick fans, this is that one asterisk in Kubrick's grand career. There's very little director trademark in this film and there is very minimal hands-on work. If anything, the cinematography --namely the shadowy interiors -- is most noteworthy. And interestingly, most of this was Kubrick's doing and not that of Russell Metty because of alleged disagreements.The unarguably great part of this film are the performances. Sir Peter Ustinov won an Oscar for his role as Lentulus, owner of the gladiator school where Spartacus is sold at the film's beginning. He is a comical man just trying to do whatever he can to insure he's buried head out of the sand rather than in. He's the pawn of the Roman powers and he earns much of our pity as the film wears on. Olivier is of course commanding the the Roman leader and Charles Laughton perfect as his rival senator, kind-hearted yet distinctly amoral.It might be Alex North's score that sums Spartacus up best. It's theme-driven music perfectly suited for an epic film, but feels completely out of context. Whereas Maurice Jarre's epic Lawrence of Arabia soundtrack captures the greatness of that film, North's is a reminder that Spartacus was an idea born in Hollywood and shot mostly in California. It just doesn't convey a sense of time or place, only that this film was made to be a head-turning film with thousands of cast members and extras. Once again, it is a film of tremendous talents, but only verges on epic greatness.~Steven CVisit my site at http\/\/moviemusereviews.com **all facts in this review courtesy IMDb trivia page ","genre":null},{"date":"18 January 2010","score":"1 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Spartacus (1960) and Lawrence of Arabia (1962) were the two great epic war films of the 1960s.
