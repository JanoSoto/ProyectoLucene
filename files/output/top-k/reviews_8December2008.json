The shots of the two characters in the same frame - touching each other, no less - are flawlessly executed. Generally, this is standard melodrama culminating in physical battles between the good guys and the bad guys and a final chase. Along the way we get a lot of exotic set pieces, lavishly furnished desert tents, horses racing across the dunes, smoky cafes in which dancing girls wriggle for tossed coins and a grand palace with spacious rooms and shiny floors. The intimate scenes between Valentino and the beauteous Vilma Banky are more sensuous than those of the previous film. Clips from these scenes will be familiar to anyone who has ever seen Valentino references in documentaries. Agnes Ayres reprises her role from The Sheik as Diana Mayo, now the wife of the older sheik and mother of his son, and she appears to have aged 20 years but is no less attractive.

Isn't that opening paragraph grouchy? My initial feelings for this film were not as negative as I may sound, it does require one viewing, but alas, this was my second time around and frustration has set in due to the missing hours I cannot get back. LA Confidential is a film that boasts truths (i.e. there was a club that had women cut like movie-stars for men), or the dirty cops, but ultimately lacks that punch to make it feel &#133; well, real. Let me explain. Upon watching this film a second time, one could notice places where the actor's voices were not synchronized to their lips; one would feel as if they were on a soundstage instead of the actual location, and finally, perhaps the largest downfall, the secondary actors not quite fitting their respected roles. I don't mean to tear apart an award winner, the people have spoken and it has already won, but it should go under scrutiny just like anything else Hollywood recycles. LA Confidential needed to be darker, it needed further development into our main characters, and it needed more blood &#150; more truth, more honest, more detail. Boasting speaking parts of over 80 people is great, but when there wasn't a strong enough story to support them, it just falls apart at the seam.With so much distress, I must admit, there were parts I enjoyed. I loved the costumes, the fantasy of this missing Hollywood. The freedom during the time seemed stronger than ever, and Hanson captured this greatly. The music countered the film greatly, focusing our attention on the time with upbeat songs and jingles. Finally, I did like where Russell Crowe went with his character. His was the only one that I believed, and trusted to portray a cop still fighting the struggle with his past. He was the darkness that we needed for this film; his character alone represented what LA Confidential should have been. He was worth watching and should have been presented with his first Oscar, but I digress. Alas, this is all I can say &#150; the rest seemed like a downward scramble into the pit of despair.Overall, I wasn't happy with this film. LA Confidential could have been the small film that knocked Titanic off its shelf, but because it was so glossed over, because it lacked the grittiness, it just felt like a Hollywood-churned product. It duped the audiences. It promised this dark world of corrupt cops and staunch criminals, but did not deliver. I wanted this to be a great noir film, a great feature to the likes of The Untouchables, but this comes nowhere close.

In American History X (1998), rated R for graphic brutal violence including rape, pervasive language, strong sexuality, and nudity, the story focuses on Derek Vinyard as he struggles to overcome the hate taught to him by his father and friends. The movie has a powerful message that steers clear of becoming a clichéd story about everybody getting along. It is a very dark movie that deals with very powerful themes such as racism and hate and also the ability to overcome these feelings. While the movie can at times feel rushed it is overall a very good movie that shows the transformation of one man and his family.In this movie all of the characters look the part of skinheads and racists, with shaved heads and clothing bearing the pictures and slogans of hate. Derek has gone one step further than this; he has covered himself in tattoos of swastikas, SS lightning bolts, and other symbols of hate. One of the most powerful scenes in this movie comes when Derek stands in front of the mirror after being released from prison and covers up the large swastika tattoo over his heart with his hand. Also when Derek is released from prison he also begins to let his hair grow out again, no longer keeping his head shaved, showing in one more way that he has changed and that he no longer agrees with the ideologies of the skinheads.The acting in this movie is excellent. Edward Norton played the character of Derek perfectly. In the flashbacks it was almost scary to watch him as he spewed racism and hate. You got the sense that this was real. In playing Danny, Edward Furlong also did a very good job, portraying the younger brother striving for his older brother's affection and respect extremely well. The rest of the supporting characters were also very well done, all the characters seemed believable and you never questioned whether the hate they had was real.While the movie has several small, mainly cosmetic flaws, it is still a very good movie with an inspiring plot line. It is a powerful movie of love and redemption.

Also when Derek is released from prison he also begins to let his hair grow out again, no longer keeping his head shaved, showing in one more way that he has changed and that he no longer agrees with the ideologies of the skinheads.The acting in this movie is excellent. Edward Norton played the character of Derek perfectly. In the flashbacks it was almost scary to watch him as he spewed racism and hate. You got the sense that this was real. In playing Danny, Edward Furlong also did a very good job, portraying the younger brother striving for his older brother's affection and respect extremely well. The rest of the supporting characters were also very well done, all the characters seemed believable and you never questioned whether the hate they had was real.While the movie has several small, mainly cosmetic flaws, it is still a very good movie with an inspiring plot line. It is a powerful movie of love and redemption.

In American History X (1998), rated R for graphic brutal violence including rape, pervasive language, strong sexuality, and nudity, the story focuses on Derek Vinyard as he struggles to overcome the hate taught to him by his father and friends. The movie has a powerful message that steers clear of becoming a clichéd story about everybody getting along. It is a very dark movie that deals with very powerful themes such as racism and hate and also the ability to overcome these feelings. While the movie can at times feel rushed it is overall a very good movie that shows the transformation of one man and his family.In this movie all of the characters look the part of skinheads and racists, with shaved heads and clothing bearing the pictures and slogans of hate.

It ends with all the pointless, cliché-ridden thriller hokum of slick Hollywood at its worst. What makes it work as well as it does is the appealing, intelligent performance of Wesley Snipes, an actor whose career has disintegrated into pointless, second-rate macho movies. Most of Murder at 1600 is an exciting ride, and I always enjoy boarding the roller coaster. Finally reaching the destination, however, is a yawn. It's all about the body of a young woman, one of the secretaries, discovered in a White House bathroom. Detective Harlan Regis (Snipes) of the D. C. Police Department is assigned to investigate. The head of the White House Secret Service detail, Nick Spikings (Daniel Benzali), isn't having any of that. The White House is his turf. Matters get complicated when the murdered woman is identified as the girl friend of the President's son. She might even have been the girlfriend of the President. Regis makes clear he's not going away. Spikings assigns one of his team to work with Regis. She's Agent Nina Chance (Diane Lane), small, highly attractive and, more to the point, smart. She's also a sharp shooter. That's a talent that will come in handy later. But is she assigned to help Regis or to spy on him and report back to Spikings? Will this be an investigation of a murder or a cover-up for a murderer? Or is the murder part of something worse...something like, say, an incursion into North Korea? What we quickly realize is that Benzali and Alan Alda, as National Security Adviser Alvin Jordan, are going to chew the scenery. By the time this complicated, high-potential mystery movie limps to its conclusion, we will have spent most of the time enjoying Wesley Snipe's charm and resourcefulness as he unthreads a conspiracy. Diane Lane's talent as an intelligent sidekick with great legs is not to be sniffed at, either. Of course, Hollywood also gives us a few nearly unkillable hit men who pop up here and there, a convenient tunnel to the White House, explosions, helicopters, car chases, kicks, grunts, the inaccurate idea that the FBI doesn't have jurisdiction over crimes committed on federal property (no big deal, some producer probably said) and a climax in the White House that involves a lot of people, including the President. But that's Hollywood big-ticket show biz. After Murder at 1600 Snipes seems to have decided that he wanted to be one of the big, macho, impervious Hollywood hero types, the kind who star in big-budget flicks aimed for the 16- through 26-year-old crowd...the kind of movies that feature awesome explosions and mano-a-mano fights with evil. Snipes was a good actor once. Don't know what happened, but Snipes personally and professionally seems to have taken the long drop. At any rate, I still enjoy Murder at 1600, and I like Snipes' performance so well I can even get past the last 25 minutes. He was one of several actors who made vivid impressions in the great, odd King of New York. In a sidekick role, he nearly edged Sean Connery off stage center in Rising Sun, and he proved he could handle comedy easily in White Men Can't Jump.

After Murder at 1600 Snipes seems to have decided that he wanted to be one of the big, macho, impervious Hollywood hero types, the kind who star in big-budget flicks aimed for the 16- through 26-year-old crowd...the kind of movies that feature awesome explosions and mano-a-mano fights with evil. Snipes was a good actor once. Don't know what happened, but Snipes personally and professionally seems to have taken the long drop. At any rate, I still enjoy Murder at 1600, and I like Snipes' performance so well I can even get past the last 25 minutes. He was one of several actors who made vivid impressions in the great, odd King of New York. In a sidekick role, he nearly edged Sean Connery off stage center in Rising Sun, and he proved he could handle comedy easily in White Men Can't Jump.

True as that may be I will never know because I never saw a Star Wars film properly until the last year and a half or so but one science fiction\/adventure hybrid fable I did have on videotape through one means or another was this Masters of the Universe, an under funded and pretty poorly thought through piece from a bunch of 'C' going on 'D' list talent made in the mid to late 1980s.I saw this film recently for the first time in what must be a decade-plus and while I didn't wear out the tape all those years ago, I saw it enough times to take a trip down memory for this occasion. You don't remember lines of dialogue or gripping narratives in scenarios like this, you remember individual shots and facial expressions from the film. As it was, Teela's (Field) reaction shot when she finds out what she's eating very early on in the film was one of them as was Gwildor's (Barty) joyous and knowing expression towards the end when he sends certain characters to a point in Earth's history they will appreciate.But enough of that and to cut right to the chase, the film is pretty poor. Although, it's that watchable sort of rubbish that accompanies the fact you saw it as a child so often that the experience now is a trip down memory lane rather than an out and out first time film viewing. To some, this might be the worst film they've ever seen and I wouldn't have a problem with that; to others, it may be their favourite and I wouldn't have a problem with that although I would point out to them that their childhood links with the piece has blinded them somewhat.I read only now that the film was originally going to take place on the planet of Eternia but budget limitations brought it to Earth &#150; there's your first clue as to how ordinary it is. The fact the film's idea of where it wanted it set had to be scrapped should really have been enough to dissuade the producers from making it, surely. But, it didn't and of course we're all glad it didn't. Masters of the Universe is one of those strange hybrids that has a clear cut hero in He-Man (Lundgren) come out of where he's familiar with (Eternia) and travel to a far off place in order to achieve something. In this case, it's Earth in order to escape evil Skeletor (Langella) and his foes who want control of an item called 'The Cosmic Key' little creature Gwildor has created. This key enables folk to travel from planet to planet and, naturally, Skeletor wants control of this contraption.But instead of being a circular journey in which a hero leaves their homeland; fights battles and defeats evil before returning home an even bigger hero, the film presents us with a typical high school romance involving Kevin (McNeill) and Julie (Cox). The idea that He-Man is the focus is still very much present but it is Julie we have more of a connection with as an audience as we feel she may be in peril at certain times and her back-story may touch us somewhat.But the film is really just a collection of nice outfits and rather unbelievable scenes. The film needs to happen in the early hours of the morning on Earth for the sake of convenience and the heroes know they have until 'moonrise' on Eternia to achieve their goal because Skeletor was kind enough to tell them that ultimatum much earlier on. Initially, monsters resembling wolf-man rip-offs and rejected Predator prototypes are sent to Earth as a scout party but it isn't long before Skeletor himself and an army of his soldiers, most of which wear body armour that resembles the troopers' in Star Wars, arrive to check things out for themselves.Although perhaps the actors in the soldier suits are the lucky ones as they don't get to have their faces revealed. I think everyone in the film, especially by the end, is accepting this as Reaganism inspired, tongue in cheek action\/adventure and nothing more. Frank Langella does a great job in bellowing his lines, demanding he be worshipped as the most powerful being in the universe &#150; indeed 'God'. But that's all he's doing and the fact the rest of the acting talent is an array of stunt men, Karate fighters and actors more used to television work sort of grates in the end, although it does bring a certain quirkiness to certain characters.The film has its charm, no doubt about it. A pumping synthetic 80s soundtrack and a great turn from James Tolkan, otherwise known as Principal Strickland from Back to the Future, whose best line is Nobody takes pop shots at Lubic! are some here and there highlights but it isn't really enough to cloud adult judgement on a childhood 'favourite'. Skeletor may have been the most powerful being in the universe at one point and he may have wanted to remain like that but how does one so powerful explain the stupidity of having a huge pit complete with lava at the bottom mere feet from where you rule on high in your throne? Regardless, I don't think he'll be back.

There is a definite feeling that by now we understand the majority of Rocky's life as an amateur and then professional boxer. By this point, it's not hard to watch the movie feeling like you know him personally.I think what made the Rocky movies so good and the Rambo movies so bad is that Rocky is just an incredibly likable person, while Rambo was tragically born without a shred of personality.It seems that Paulie has unknowingly signed over power of attorney to their accountant, who did a little gambling with the Balboas' money thinking he could win big and then return it before they even knew it was gone, and ultimately they end up losing millions. They are forced to sell everything and basically start over back in the same neighborhood where Rocky lived before he fought Apollo Creed.Thankfully, the son has been recast after they cast that goofy white kid in Part 4, although now he's a rich, geeky, spoiled punk. He has become accustomed to living the good life and sinks into depression when they have to sell all of their material possessions and revert back to the sad life that his father grew up in. When they move to the bad neighborhood his naiveté makes me think of an ignorant prince gleefully attempting to mingle with the common folk, thinking maybe he can make friends with them by commenting on how charming and cute their poor lifestyle is. Dumbass.Soon Rocky is preoccupied with a promising and ambitious young boxer that he meets one day on the street corner. His son is preoccupied with the punks that keep beating him up at school but Rocky never seems to have time for him anymore because he's putting so much time and energy into training this new guy, curiously named Tommy Gunn. Unfortunately, things pretty soon begin to go south when the press keeps labeling Tommy Rocky's Pupil, Clone, Robot, etc.The conflict of the film is centered on Rocky not allowing Tommy to fight for George Washington Duke, a major boxing promoter who wants to make Tommy his next protégé. The problem is that the conflict comes from Rocky telling Tommy that Duke doesn't care about him, he only wants to make money off him and then throw him away when he's no good anymore, but in the real world there's really no problem with Tommy fighting for Duke.Yeah, Duke has no personal interest in the guy and no emotional connection, but all Tommy wants is a chance at a real career in boxing. He doesn't need a best friend or a father figure, he just wants to get recognized and make some money. And Duke could probably make that happen a lot better than Rocky could.But Rocky is Rocky and we love him, so when Tommy disrespects him, taunting him and challenging him to a fight to prove himself once and for all, we want to see Tommy have his ass handed to him. Rocky, meanwhile, has developed neural damage from all the blows to the head that he's received throughout his career, making a prize fight impossible because no doctor is fool enough to give him medical approval to fight.From there, the movie goes in a slightly different direction. It's not as exciting and big as the previous movies, but is still a good ride. The biggest problem with the movie, however, is the son, who is not only a rich geek but also an arrogant little bastard with no respect for his mother or father or anyone else. He throws a hissy fit on Christmas Day and takes off with his little friend, and soon even shows up wearing this long, dangling earring and talking all tough to his dad. I haven't seen a kid in such need of a good smack since Stallone's other son in Over The Top. WOW.The problem is that Rocky is too benevolent and too likable, so when his son acts like this, it is only natural to side with Rocky and wish he would just send the little punk off to military school or something, but instead Rocky works to earn his respect.

When they move to the bad neighborhood his naiveté makes me think of an ignorant prince gleefully attempting to mingle with the common folk, thinking maybe he can make friends with them by commenting on how charming and cute their poor lifestyle is. Dumbass.Soon Rocky is preoccupied with a promising and ambitious young boxer that he meets one day on the street corner. His son is preoccupied with the punks that keep beating him up at school but Rocky never seems to have time for him anymore because he's putting so much time and energy into training this new guy, curiously named Tommy Gunn. Unfortunately, things pretty soon begin to go south when the press keeps labeling Tommy Rocky's Pupil, Clone, Robot, etc.The conflict of the film is centered on Rocky not allowing Tommy to fight for George Washington Duke, a major boxing promoter who wants to make Tommy his next protégé. The problem is that the conflict comes from Rocky telling Tommy that Duke doesn't care about him, he only wants to make money off him and then throw him away when he's no good anymore, but in the real world there's really no problem with Tommy fighting for Duke.Yeah, Duke has no personal interest in the guy and no emotional connection, but all Tommy wants is a chance at a real career in boxing. He doesn't need a best friend or a father figure, he just wants to get recognized and make some money. And Duke could probably make that happen a lot better than Rocky could.But Rocky is Rocky and we love him, so when Tommy disrespects him, taunting him and challenging him to a fight to prove himself once and for all, we want to see Tommy have his ass handed to him. Rocky, meanwhile, has developed neural damage from all the blows to the head that he's received throughout his career, making a prize fight impossible because no doctor is fool enough to give him medical approval to fight.From there, the movie goes in a slightly different direction. It's not as exciting and big as the previous movies, but is still a good ride. The biggest problem with the movie, however, is the son, who is not only a rich geek but also an arrogant little bastard with no respect for his mother or father or anyone else. He throws a hissy fit on Christmas Day and takes off with his little friend, and soon even shows up wearing this long, dangling earring and talking all tough to his dad. I haven't seen a kid in such need of a good smack since Stallone's other son in Over The Top. WOW.The problem is that Rocky is too benevolent and too likable, so when his son acts like this, it is only natural to side with Rocky and wish he would just send the little punk off to military school or something, but instead Rocky works to earn his respect. The movie goes in a completely different direction than the previous films and is noticeably less impressive, but the heart's in the right place and when it comes to Rocky movies, that's the most important thing&#133; ","genre":"Drama, Sport"},{"date":"8 December 2008","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" I watched this film after I got on a, 'Let's watch some controversial movies' stint...*yawn* Look, we get it - oh the depravity...taking power back, going crazy, rampage, carnage, nothingness and throw in some Kierkegaard - still not that great of a movie.The plot is non-existent, the dialog is freaking horrible (even w\/ the subs), the direction is lame and the timing is blah at best.

One could speculate that this is because it's been ripped off as much as Chuck Berry. Lucky Number Slevin is your obvious example, but that might not be why it translates so poorly. I think it's the classic shot of Grant and the CIA man with Mt. Rushmore in the background. Most of my peers saw Richie Rich before they saw (if they've seen) North by Northwest and the cheesiness of the older and often wiser generations. I hate to be the kind of guy that doesn't think of technological ability as relative. Especially since it's so often misused in modern cinema to craft a movie with less than 50 pages of a script.I'm holding the position that it doesn't translate well because of this a) The crop dusting scene is ridiculously suspenseful but can we really imagine how crazy it was in '59? b) same exact story for the Mt. Rushmore cliffhanger scene. c) Grant's banter, if not monitored closely, falls on deaf ears to the people of today, even my parents couldn't catch all the wise-cracks. We just speak a different language. d) Eva Marie Sant's lines are littered with innuendo's that would make a middle schooler's toes curl. Her sexiness has been forgotten by time and slang.So, in short, the reason that North by Northwest doesn't translate into my generation (.com generation if you were wondering) is because it's simply too good, it's shocking and will alter the way that anyone thinks about what constitutes a good movie. It isn't that we don't have the taste, I think it's more that we never had a chance to witness the awesome power of cinema contained within. Don't be offended if you are of equal age with me and plaster pictures of Cary Grant on your wall, I think you would agree with me if I said that this movie was beyond modern comprehension and stood up with some of the greatest artistic works of the last 50 years.
