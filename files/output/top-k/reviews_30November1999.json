OK, this isn't the most violent, amusing, mentally challenging or disturbing film I have ever seen but the sheer blend of all these qualities is what makes this film probably my favourite this year.The film starts fairly simply, following the life of an insomniac office jockey trying to find a route to happiness but before too long you find it delving into deeper things. Much, much deeper things. And just when you thought it couldn't get any deeper or more intimidating, it does.And that's the beauty of it. The narration and the performances take place in such a relaxed, laid back style you don't realise just how serious some things really are until half a second later than you should. Then it hits you twice as hard as it would do otherwise, leaving 'wow' the only word on your mind. And you can completely forget about trying to predict the plot of this film. It twists more times than I care to count but in the end it all makes perfect sence.In my opinion, this is David Fincher's finest film yet, even eclipsing Seven. This is the sort of film where you can forget about technical things and get completely immersed. You also have to think whilst you watch it and I like that a lot. Not only that, but you will be left thinking about it for weeks afterwards. The acting performances by the main characters is superb all round and that includes Meatloaf. There is more style than you could shake a stick at.Bad points? To be honest, I enjoyed the film so much that I can't think of any off the top of my head. It did get a bit surreal and freaky in places but then again those are the two words of the day when it comes down to it.Be warned however, this film won't appeal to everybody. It does take a rather uncompromising scoop into the human psyche and deals in a lot of primal urges and quite expectedly, it gets violent in places. This won't appeal to everyone but it certainly struck a chord with me. It makes a change to the usual stuff Hollywood normally churns out at least.

We all love to see him in films like Terminator and Predator where everything was just so fun and enjoyable to watch.  End of Days however, although full of some pretty good action sequences, seems to be lacking.I don't know where to really point my finger exactly.

Of course they do look rather similar and it's obviously rather hard, make that rather impossible, to be a better Satan than Al Pacino.

And good scenes don't always make a good movie, you shouldn't walk out of a film saying that one part was so cool... you should be saying that film was so cool.  Chances of me seeing it again are rather rare and chances of me recommending it to others is also probubly not going to happen.

What we have here is the opportunity for a tight, exciting, gloriously spectacular 007 adventure, but due to the filmmakers' decision to substitute juvenile humour for thrills at every opportunity, the final result is sporadically enjoyable at best, placing this overblown entry on the very bottom rung of the Bond ladder (well, the official Bond ladder anyway - at least it's still miles ahead of Never Say Never Again). Keen observers may notice that the end credits of The Spy Who Loved Me stated James Bond Will Return in 'For Your Eyes Only'. And if you'll pardon the pun, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out the success of a little film called Star Wars inspired the producers to send 007 to outer space instead.Needless to say, that decision was a far cry from Ian Fleming's original vision. His original novelization of Moonraker was a solid page-turner about an megalomaniacal villain's scheme to fire a nuclear rocket into the heart of London and even contained a scene where Bond almost makes the shocking decision to sacrifice his own life to save the city. This time, the villain wants to wipe out all life on earth and start his own utopia of perfect human specimens. Of course, ludicrous storylines like this are what make the Bond franchise what it is, but this is probably the only entry in the series that actually manages to be MORE silly than the Austin Powers films that spoof it. The first half hour gives an indication of how much better the film might have been had it played things more straight. Things start off dynamically with a breathtaking sky-diving sequence that is undoubtedly one of the best teasers in the series and also earns high marks later on for a scene in which Bond is trapped helplessly on a G-force simulator. It is one of the very few instances in the series where 007 is left too shaken up to even utter a one-liner, but unfortunately, this is the ONLY moment in the film where an action setpiece is not completely obliterated by an overuse of low, cornball humour and juvenile sight gags.By the time Moonraker has reached its outer space finale, all suspense has been drained away and the flashy battle sequence, while undoubtedly expensive, is pretty underwhelming, especially when compared to the climactic setpieces in The Spy Who Loved Me. The supporting cast also does little to enhance the proceedings. Lois Chiles is awfully wooden as the aptly-named heroine, Dr. Holly Goodhead, and Michel Lonsdale, despite having a great deal of witty dialogue (Take good care of Mr. Bond. See that some harm comes to him), is one of the more dull Bond villains, mainly because he speaks in monotone throughout the entire film and doesn't even seem to truly relish his evil schemes. And then there's the character of Jaws, who was arguably the most memorable Bond villain of them all in TSWLM, but has his credibility completely shattered here. The character is now portrayed as an inane buffoon who could never stop 007 if his life depended on it, and a scene midway through in which he suddenly falls head-over-heels in love has got to be the most embarrasing moment in the entire series, bar none! As you can imagine, I didn't much care about anything that happened in the film after that, which pretty much sums why Moonraker is so frustrating. 007 has always held a license to be as he silly as he wants, but this particular entry demonstrates that boundaries DO have to be drawn somewhere. You know you're in the trouble when it gets to the point where the appearance of Mini-Me would lend more credibility to the proceedings!

The character is now portrayed as an inane buffoon who could never stop 007 if his life depended on it, and a scene midway through in which he suddenly falls head-over-heels in love has got to be the most embarrasing moment in the entire series, bar none! As you can imagine, I didn't much care about anything that happened in the film after that, which pretty much sums why Moonraker is so frustrating. 007 has always held a license to be as he silly as he wants, but this particular entry demonstrates that boundaries DO have to be drawn somewhere. You know you're in the trouble when it gets to the point where the appearance of Mini-Me would lend more credibility to the proceedings!

Or when he holds the harpoon gun over the other girl for like 30 seconds as she screams no no no no endlessly.  Tons of stuff way outta place.  In the old days his victims didnt have the chance to scream let alone say no.  Only two kills remotely resemble the old Jason, the head-punch-off and the sauna rock to the gut.

The Tommy Jarvis character from the last installment is brought back, though now in his late teens and off to a halfway house as he continues to deal with his Jason experience.  As most have noted, Jason did not attend this go round, but the killer who replaces him has the same talent with sharp objects so nothings lost.  Those who say the killers easy to figure out I dont believe cuz it being a Friday film I just assumed it was Jason.  Only after the sherriffs explanation and multiple viewings did I realize the identity.  But this is still the best because of body count with over 20 slashed (some in dream sequence) and the way they're done is truly inventive.  Hedge trimmers in eyes, a dude killed in an outhouse, and the most hilarious one, a flare shoved in someones mouth.  And lets not forget the females, like cute heroine Kinneman, brief but gorgeous Sharkey, and titanic breasted Debisue Voorhees.  With all that this would have to be the greatest, but I'd say a majority of the other reviews would be against it.  Ya gotta at least like the cast, Shepard as Tommy, Ross as the kid, Pavlon as the stuttering nerd (I wanna mmmmake llllove with you still makes me bust up) and Locatell is a hoot as foul mouthed Edna, to mention a few.

It doesn't attack the religion, but rather points out that it has become less effective and meaningful to people. It criticizes the ways in which people have misinterpreted it.Dogma is a story of two angels, thrown out of heaven ages ago for disobeying God. The two, Loki and Bartleby, decide that they no longer wish to stay on earth and plan to return home. With the discovery of a loophole in a New Jersey Church, their quest is possible. However, should they be successful in their return to heaven, the will of God would be defeated and the world would cease to exist. This provides for a very interesting story. Dogma sees the return of Jay and Silent Bob who have appeared in each one of Kevin Smith's movies. They are funny once again. The film features great writing and several interesting dialogues. Ben Affleck and Matt Damon are great together as the two fallen angels. Linda Fiorentino, a non believer, is chosen as the world's savior and Chris Rock plays the 13th apostle. This becomes a very interesting situation. Each person attempts to impose his beliefs on another. The conversations are both entertaining and humorous. Serious talk about religion is mixed in with swearing and joking producing colorful dialogue. Although it is mostly conversation, the film fascinated me and kept me interested.

She does a little microfiche sleuthing and finds that other tenants have met untimely ends. Seems that evil is aloft. Meanwhile she meets two guys intent on releasing her from the sexual doldrums, one a best selling macho writer (Tom Berenger), the other a pretty boy with charm (William Baldwin). Somebody mysteriously gives her a telescope so she can check the action through the windows of the high rises around town. Meanwhile we are flashed shots of the tenants as though on video tape. Stone opts for Baldwin who seduces her. This is interesting Stone crying tears of joyful release as she climaxes. Afterward it is revealed that he owns the apartment and has set up surveillance cameras in the walls to spy on the inhabitants.I forget what this is ripped off from-maybe Crawlspace (1986)-but believe it or not, there was a man in Alaska a few years back who actually did this sort of spying on a modest scale. He had a four-plex or the like with peep holes in the bathroom, etc. It was on the news. Here we have high tech spying from a war room with monitors along the wall and an easy chair. Charming boy truly likes to watch.The main problem with this film is the source material. Ira Levin, who penned the novel, never presumed to literature while managing a very successful career shocking the book club set with such made-into-movie hits as Rosemary's Baby and The Stepford Wives. His first success, and perhaps the only thing genuine book he ever published, was No Time for Sergeants from the fifties. The other novels suffer from flashy fake premises that lead to psychological waters never fully navigated. In Sliver what is not engaged is the character of a man who would choose to spy on his neighbors as a way of life. It is like throwing him in a grab bag to make him into your standard issue psycho killer. As such he is left unexplored.A secondary problem is Phillip Noyce's uninspired and underdeveloped direction. We can see, even without reading the novel, that heroine Carly Norris was a somewhat frumpy, sexually fallow woman headed straight for matronhood. If only they had the guts to play her full out like that. But Stone seemed ill at ease in such an unfamiliar role and Noyce couldn't be bothered with nuances. A tertiary problem is the casting of Stone in the first place. It might be said that Miss Stone, with her on-screen rapacious sexual appetite and her success at any cost cinematic persona, is truly a woman for the 'nineties. (If so, it makes me long for the woman of the 'oughts.) At her best Stone is a professional without charm, but unless she is cast as a slutty, evil, predatory female, she just doesn't cut it at all. In the war room she reverts partially to her usual persona as she goes along with Baldwin's sick program, and she comes to life. Here we glimpse what might have been done with the premise the surveillance cameras strip away all privacy and for a moment the man who welds them is exposed as a nazi-like monster, while she is confronted with her own compromised nature.A final problem is the ending. It's an inappropriate joke told by someone insensitive to any context. Yet I can see how Noyce thought it might work Carly Norris not only looks like his mother, but now she punishes him as a mother would, by destroying his toys and telling him to grow up. She actually says, Get a life. Maybe she should have given him a spanking as well.(Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

I am a die-hard James Bond fan (I own all the videos) and have most of the soundtracks.  It is definitely one of the more well-rounded James Bond films, with a nice balance between action, drama, and plot.  I saw it three times in one week, but I think it takes that many viewings in order to fully understand the complicated plot.I think that the acting (with exception of Denise Richards) was superb all around, although I could never grasp how a villain like Renard could come across as so frightening that he could drive one of his henchman to suicide (You'll know what I mean when you see the film).  He seemed very diminutive and sometimes I even sympathized with him when he couldn't feel any pain.Even so, I enjoyed Robert Carlyle's performance, as well as Sophie Marceau's.  There was talk about Sharon Stone playing the role of Elektra, but I don't think that Sharon Stone could have played the part any better. I wouldn't have been able to generate sympathy had she played the part. Sophie Marceau played a tortured Bond Girl with conviction.  Now that's what we need, some good Bond girl characterization!!  She's the best bond girl since Octopussy.Denise Richards was good to look at, but many of my friends couldn't help but giggle every time she said a word on screen.  As a nuclear physicist she sounded very Teeny-Bopperish.Pierce Brosnan?  What can I say?  The credits are wrong.  They show Pierce Brosnan AS Ian Fleming's James Bond 007.  The as should be an is. Pierce Brosnan IS James Bond 007!!By the way, did anyone notice in the opening credits scene that John Cleese was NOT credited.  Now that is an injustice considering that he is the most popular star, save Pierce Brosnan and Desmond Llewelyn, in the entire movie!!!!!  He needed more screen time.  I think he was perfectly cast considering he had very little to work with.Go see this one more than once.  It's worth it each time!!

I saw it three times in one week, but I think it takes that many viewings in order to fully understand the complicated plot.I think that the acting (with exception of Denise Richards) was superb all around, although I could never grasp how a villain like Renard could come across as so frightening that he could drive one of his henchman to suicide (You'll know what I mean when you see the film).  He seemed very diminutive and sometimes I even sympathized with him when he couldn't feel any pain.Even so, I enjoyed Robert Carlyle's performance, as well as Sophie Marceau's.  There was talk about Sharon Stone playing the role of Elektra, but I don't think that Sharon Stone could have played the part any better. I wouldn't have been able to generate sympathy had she played the part. Sophie Marceau played a tortured Bond Girl with conviction.  Now that's what we need, some good Bond girl characterization!!  She's the best bond girl since Octopussy.Denise Richards was good to look at, but many of my friends couldn't help but giggle every time she said a word on screen.  As a nuclear physicist she sounded very Teeny-Bopperish.Pierce Brosnan?  What can I say?  The credits are wrong.  They show Pierce Brosnan AS Ian Fleming's James Bond 007.  The as should be an is. Pierce Brosnan IS James Bond 007!!By the way, did anyone notice in the opening credits scene that John Cleese was NOT credited.  Now that is an injustice considering that he is the most popular star, save Pierce Brosnan and Desmond Llewelyn, in the entire movie!!!!!  He needed more screen time.  I think he was perfectly cast considering he had very little to work with.Go see this one more than once.  It's worth it each time!!

This came out around the same time as Pokemon. Both are animated and Japanese. The similarities end there. Princess Mononoke is not a kids movie. Kids could see it if they wanted to but it's not the sachrine-sweet that disney usually churns out. This is an amazing anime film. The art is beautiful and brilliant, there were times I forgot I was looking at animation. This is a medium that allows the filmmaker to do so much more than you could with live-action. Anime is not new or anything but this is the first time I ever got to see one on the big screen. The story is about an epic battle between the animals and humans. It is so so good.

Most of the actors looked confused and more wooden than the robots they communicate with.  (Samuel L. Jackson looks to be in the wrong movie entirely.)  It's a shame that someone with the vision of Lucas has so little ability to see that vision come to life.  In two or three years, the film will be completely forgotten.  In fact, during the screening I saw in Hollywood, the audience pretty much went to sleep after their initial excitement at the first twenty minutes or so. The loudest reaction was for C3PO and R2D2. Truly a disappointment and not a very worthy sequel to such a film as The Empire Strikes Back, which was really a breathtaking film.

Centering around a skinhead's sin and redemption, and the effect that his actions have on his family, American History X is a definite classic. This movie is gripping, spellbinding (despite half of it being filmed in black and white), and the ending sequence may even cause you to drop a tear. However, with every classic comes lots of mistakes, and it's these mistakes that prevented American History X from getting better recognition and more awards.Of course, I can't start pointing out the movie's flaws without first singing the praises of central star Edward Norton. His performance in this movie absolutely redefines the word bravura.  Another great thing about Norton in this movie is that his character is probably one of the most well-written skinheads I've ever seen in a movie. Young screenwriter David McKenna really painted Derek in broad strokes, making him intelligent, well-informed, calculating, and even calm at some points.Unfortunately, aside from Norton's performance, there is really nothing else to cheer about in this movie. There are many logical flaws for instance, how does one run-in in prison cause Derek to completely change around his whole mentality? How does this event make him realize that Nazism is the wrong way? That's never explained. There are also flashback sequences in this movie that also make some errors. In one scene, Derek is thrown out of his house after cursing out the Jewish teacher. But in the beginning of the movie, Derek is back  in the house to commit the double murder.Derek's fat friend Seth is a by-the-numbers skinhead, right down to Nazi music in the car. Cameron (as played by Stacy Keach) is probably the second most interesting character in the movie. He is cunning, looks like everyman, and has a whole nation of skinheads wrapped around his finger (a la Hitler). But McKenna simply introduces him by name, sets up some confrontation with Danny, and brings him on screen just so Derek can knock him out. And the whole thing with Sweeny just didn't belong in this movie. Even though he is crucial to the plot, it could've been restructered so Sweeny wasn't involved at all. But overall, this is a flawed but extremely worthy movie. Don't let these little flaws turn you away from it at the video store. This well worth the watch for anybody at all.
