The time this story took place was around the 1920's. In this film there are two main stars Gary Sinise who plays George and John Malkovich who plays Lennie's character. Lennie is a little bit slow and needs George to guide him and help him along the way. George is very mature and takes care of not only himself but Lennie too. At times he gets frustrated and upset, but at the end of the day he loves Lennie. Even though at times in this film there would be a joke or a laugh this was not a comedy it was a drama and very serious throughout. This movie begins with two men running away from a large group of men and dogs. It does not show why they are running away but you notice they are very scared and are sprinting for what could be there lives. In the movie they hide in very thick grass to escape these men and finally travel along the road. While they travel George knows exactly where they are going to go. They have to find a new place to work so they can obtain money. George often tells Lennie about a house and land with bunnies, this is what their goal is after they raise enough money. They dream of having their own place to live and their own land to tend. When they arrive at the ranch they are going to work at, they see where they will be staying. Lennie doesn't like this place at all, but he realizes that if they work hard enough and stay out of trouble he will be able to take care of the rabbits on their own ranch. During their stay at the ranch the head ranchers son Curly picks on Lennie because of his disability. He tries to get into fights with him. One night Curly started to punch Lennie repeatedly in the face until finally George gave Lennie the okay to fight back. Once he fought back he completely crushed Curly's hand with only one arm. Even though Lennie is slow he is extremely strong and can crush anything or anyone with only one hand. Curly found this out the hard way. Although Lennie crushed Curly's hand he did not want to, he doesn't like violence and wouldn't choose to fight if he didn't have to. One night George goes out to the town with some of the guys and leaves Lennie at the ranch by himself. While Lennie wanders around, he comes to a single room with a light on. He goes in and is immediately met by a man yelling at him. This man was the only black man on the ranch and was secluded from the rest of the workers because of his skin color. However Lennie didn't understand any of this and just wanted someone to talk to. At the first sight of Lennie the man was angry and thought it made no sense coming in there since nobody had before. After the beginning outburst they sat down and talked or a while until George came back and took Lennie back to their room. While the men work on the ranch most of the other look at Lennie in a strange way because he is different than most people. However one of the head ranchers Slim is very pleased to have him a part of his group considering his strength. While other men go in two's to carry bags of different things Lennie can do it all by himself and make it a much faster system. This makes the rancher very pleased and shows Lennie in a good light. Music in a film is a huge role and can make or break a movie in some cases. The reason it is such a huge deal is because a lot of times music can determine the mood of a person or of an entire scene for that matter. When there is something bad happening or sad the music usually follows that emotion. In times of happiness there is an upbeat and uplifting song to go along with that certain scene. In this movie there were many occasions where music was an important part of the scene such as the opening scene. In the first scene you see two men running for what would seem like their lives. In the back round the music is fast and somewhat angry and this goes along with the scene perfectly. Another example where music is a large part in the movie is the scene where George becomes very angry and upset with Lennie. They are by the river during this scene and there was a sad melody playing in the background that suits this scene just right. Another aspect of film is the acting. It is very important, this is how the actors present themselves and make sure they play the role correctly. In the film Of Mice and Men, John Malkovich plays Lennie. John Malkovich plays a person with a disability. However in real life he does not have that disability, therefore in this movie he did a wonderful job showing the audience the real character and how the director wanted him to be portrayed. Gary Sinise who is also the director of the film plays George. George is very stern and is known for being mature and in charge. Gary Sinise does a very great job of showing the audience how George should be looked at. Overall I think this was a tremendous film, the director and actors did a wonderful job showing the viewers how the story was suppose to be portrayed. If you are looking for a funny happy movie this is definitely not the movie for you. Even though I believe this is a great movie it is also very sad and you may find yourself crying at certain points during the movie.

Having re-watched and enjoyed Omen 1 and 2, from which the combination of Jerry Goldsmiths score and creepy camera work left me pretty disturbed, I was looking forward to the third and final instalment which I hadn't seen before.What a massive disappointment.This film is a complete and total waste of so many good talents.Sam Neill is pretty good as Damian Thorne. Sly, authoritative when necessary and pretty twisted in certain scenes. Check out the first scene in his satanic chapel as a perfect example of how the character should be played. Excellently done.The problem here is that the basic premise of the Omen films has been thrown out of the window. I'll admit the writers here did have a challenge. They had to fulfil the prophecy elements stated in the earlier versions and somehow tie all that together with some sort of satisfying conclusion.So many story points are present but have no bearing on the rest of the plot. Damian becomes the US ambassador to the UK like his (adopted) father before him. This seems to have been required in the story because it's stated in the earlier films that he will rise through the world of politics. Damian also becomes the head of the UN's children's program and this point is given a fair amount of attention at the beginning of the film but once again this comes to nothing in the story.The prior two films set this story up and it's quite clear to me how the story was intended to progress. Why on earth didn't they follow this? The story as intended by Damian Omen 2 should run as follows...Damian as head of Thorn Industries has bought up huge amounts of the worlds agricultural land and holds power over food distribution creating famine wherever he pleases. It's through this that he is able to bring the world into conflict and bring about the end of days.Once again this plot point is mentioned at the beginning of the 3rd film but nothing ever comes of it. Such a frustrating waste.The staple of The Omen films is the bizarre, random (sometimes overly complex) death scenes to those characters who threaten the antichrists ascension but once again this core element of the films is abandoned. This was the coolest signature of the films inspiring a feeling of dread in the viewer. You know they're screwed but you don't know when it's coming. The idea was taken forward by the Final Destination films with good effect. That's the fun part... and unfortunately it's missing.Instead we have Rotweilers with hypo abilities (seen in the first film when the nanny hangs herself) and this is massively overused. The whole thing feels like a particularly bad episode of tales of the unexpected.There is also a bizarre scene where Damian addresses his followers. The location is never disclosed and the followers appear to be a collection of Monty Python caricatures. Perhaps the most silly of these are the two boy scouts...I found myself laughing out loud at some of the supposedly terrifying death scenes (especially the one at the BBC which is so silly you can't help but laugh).In my opinion this film needs to be re-made to service the overall story with the ending it deserves. I want to watch each of the various strands of Damian Thorn's devilish plans slot into place perfectly as age of Satan draws closer by his design. Whether he fails or succeeds is irrelevant... We deserved a better ending than this!

Damian becomes the US ambassador to the UK like his (adopted) father before him. This seems to have been required in the story because it's stated in the earlier films that he will rise through the world of politics. Damian also becomes the head of the UN's children's program and this point is given a fair amount of attention at the beginning of the film but once again this comes to nothing in the story.The prior two films set this story up and it's quite clear to me how the story was intended to progress. Why on earth didn't they follow this? The story as intended by Damian Omen 2 should run as follows...Damian as head of Thorn Industries has bought up huge amounts of the worlds agricultural land and holds power over food distribution creating famine wherever he pleases. It's through this that he is able to bring the world into conflict and bring about the end of days.Once again this plot point is mentioned at the beginning of the 3rd film but nothing ever comes of it. Such a frustrating waste.The staple of The Omen films is the bizarre, random (sometimes overly complex) death scenes to those characters who threaten the antichrists ascension but once again this core element of the films is abandoned. This was the coolest signature of the films inspiring a feeling of dread in the viewer. You know they're screwed but you don't know when it's coming. The idea was taken forward by the Final Destination films with good effect. That's the fun part... and unfortunately it's missing.Instead we have Rotweilers with hypo abilities (seen in the first film when the nanny hangs herself) and this is massively overused. The whole thing feels like a particularly bad episode of tales of the unexpected.There is also a bizarre scene where Damian addresses his followers. The location is never disclosed and the followers appear to be a collection of Monty Python caricatures. Perhaps the most silly of these are the two boy scouts...I found myself laughing out loud at some of the supposedly terrifying death scenes (especially the one at the BBC which is so silly you can't help but laugh).In my opinion this film needs to be re-made to service the overall story with the ending it deserves. I want to watch each of the various strands of Damian Thorn's devilish plans slot into place perfectly as age of Satan draws closer by his design. Whether he fails or succeeds is irrelevant... We deserved a better ending than this!

Having re-watched and enjoyed Omen 1 and 2, from which the combination of Jerry Goldsmiths score and creepy camera work left me pretty disturbed, I was looking forward to the third and final instalment which I hadn't seen before.What a massive disappointment.This film is a complete and total waste of so many good talents.Sam Neill is pretty good as Damian Thorne. Sly, authoritative when necessary and pretty twisted in certain scenes. Check out the first scene in his satanic chapel as a perfect example of how the character should be played.

Mars Attacks! is not his best(Edward Scissorhands), but far from his worst(Planet of the Apes)- in fact Mars Attacks! gets my vote as Burton's most underrated film. Mars Attacks! is a film you love or hate really, but I like it and consider it underrated and somewhat as a guilty pleasure.The film does have a slow start and it does take a little too long before the fun starts. What I loved about Mars Attacks! though was its smartness, fun and in some ways uniqueness. It does make the most of a bubble-gum card story, and works brilliantly as a biting satire, and is further advantaged by some excellent visuals not only in the computer-generated bug-eyed Martians but in the photography, make-up and sets, wonderfully clever sci-fi references, a smart script and a quirky score from Danny Elfman. Tim Burton's direction is also great, and the acting is all fun. While Jack Nicholson, Glenn Close, Danny DeVito, Martin Short, Pam Grier and Annette Bening are a lot of fun, the best performances come from Pierce Brosnan who is hilarious as a presidential adviser and Lisa Marie who is weird yet wonderfully creepy and seductive as the disguised alien temptress. Overall, I really enjoyed this film. It is not Burton's best, but it is better than most of the stuff he's churned out this past decade-Big Fish and Sweeney Todd are the only ones so far that had the charm and uniqueness that made me love Scissorhands, Ed Wood, Batman and Vincent so much. 8\/10 Bethany Cox ","genre":null},{"date":"4 October 2010","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" While he has been hit and miss recently, I like Tim Burton.

Immediately upon arrival at the Tyler Ranch the bosses son Curley begins to pick on Linnie. Curley was a little guy who is even described in the film has a little guy who likes to pick on big guys. Curley abuses his position as the bosses son and picks on and bullies all the guys who work at the ranch. Curley has a wife who is also under his abuse.

Sinise did a excellent job at showing what a difficult character George was and showing the emotion through the characters.

At its inception Bride of Frankenstein seems to have represented all that is worst about sequels. It reopens the story of a perfectly structured picture that needed no further elaboration, indeed rewriting the end of that picture in order to make the new story fit. As if this audacity was not enough, we open with no less an authority than Lord Byron recapping the plot of the 1931 movie, even though that was only loosely based on his contemporary Mary Shelley's novel. This whole set-up has a feel of it's probably been a few years since you saw the original, so won't notice you're essentially being shown a substandard knock-off, only with bigger sets and better makeup which is essentially all Bride of Frankenstein is, in outline at least.Somewhere along the line however, the picture was apparently hijacked and turned into a farcical and self-deprecating comedy. Original screenwriter William Hurlbut was no funny man, but the script would go through several other hands, including those of the very talented R.C. Sheriff who was the primary writer on The Invisible Man. This was probably all under the auspices of the somewhat ribald and rebellious director James Whale. In fact, much of the comedy material has the look of having been improvised, especially that with the wildly over-the-top Una O'Connor, so is probably that of the team on set more than any writer. Bride of Frankenstein takes the silliness of horror-comedy The Invisible Man and takes it one step further, from jolly counterpoint into absolute parody. It's hard to know where the overt melodrama ends and the hysterical daftness begins &#x96; all in all a good thing, because if this were just melodramatic horror cliché it would be a far poorer film.At pre-production however the original aim seems to have been to increase the sinister and creepy atmosphere of the original. The sets, not only larger, are far more baroque and expressionist. Even the Frankenstein family home, a fairly regular mansion in 1931, is now a cavernous Gothic castle. The result is tonal overkill. Whale, rather than trying to restrain this inflated production, simply indulges. His trademark tracking shots are at their most effective here, foreground props all over the place and wheeling manoeuvres that give real resonance to those interiors. Other than this however Whale's direction is for the most part a little more relaxed than usual, as if what is before his camera is bizarre enough.So, all this overstatement, the cheerfully dismissive manner in which characters are bumped off, the screeching of Una O'Connor (not very funny, but I do love the way she says just because he's a burgomaster, sounding wonderfully out-of-place with a cockney accent) was clearly done for a purpose &#x96; sending up the strains of pompous melodrama, fighting fire with fire. But does the exaggerated approach rescue Bride of Frankenstein from typical sequel trashiness? Not quite. The tone here is not so much one of triumphal reworking as one of flippancy. It seems that Whale and whoever else was on his side were simply reacting against the commercial lowness of the picture as the studio intended it. It's quite clear Bride of Frankenstein is a product of conflict more than collaboration and when compared to its predecessor is a rather middling affair.

Original screenwriter William Hurlbut was no funny man, but the script would go through several other hands, including those of the very talented R.C. Sheriff who was the primary writer on The Invisible Man. This was probably all under the auspices of the somewhat ribald and rebellious director James Whale.

It's hard to know where the overt melodrama ends and the hysterical daftness begins &#x96; all in all a good thing, because if this were just melodramatic horror cliché it would be a far poorer film.At pre-production however the original aim seems to have been to increase the sinister and creepy atmosphere of the original. The sets, not only larger, are far more baroque and expressionist. Even the Frankenstein family home, a fairly regular mansion in 1931, is now a cavernous Gothic castle. The result is tonal overkill. Whale, rather than trying to restrain this inflated production, simply indulges. His trademark tracking shots are at their most effective here, foreground props all over the place and wheeling manoeuvres that give real resonance to those interiors. Other than this however Whale's direction is for the most part a little more relaxed than usual, as if what is before his camera is bizarre enough.So, all this overstatement, the cheerfully dismissive manner in which characters are bumped off, the screeching of Una O'Connor (not very funny, but I do love the way she says just because he's a burgomaster, sounding wonderfully out-of-place with a cockney accent) was clearly done for a purpose &#x96; sending up the strains of pompous melodrama, fighting fire with fire. But does the exaggerated approach rescue Bride of Frankenstein from typical sequel trashiness? Not quite. The tone here is not so much one of triumphal reworking as one of flippancy. It seems that Whale and whoever else was on his side were simply reacting against the commercial lowness of the picture as the studio intended it. It's quite clear Bride of Frankenstein is a product of conflict more than collaboration and when compared to its predecessor is a rather middling affair.

The death scene in this movie is the greatest depiction of whatever death would look like, a hypnotically scary immensity of nothingness, that's what space is all about  death. 2001 is a movie about space, space as death, death as loneliness, and loneliness as our Human Condition.There's no eating, no feeling, no loving, no caring in this films, even the 'little girl' sequence seems so 'badly done', I mean unlike Kubrick's usual work, these things that are so important for us, poor mortal souls, seem so futile and pointless in 2001, because space is death. But space is also synonym of escape and quest, quest for immortality by escaping our human condition, it's like the key of 'immortality' is our dehumanization, a dream impossible to reach, because the alternative of our mortality isn't depicted as being a machine, but being a God-like figure, like Dave, when he was terminating Hal-9000.God created men in his own image like men created HAL, the most intelligent creature\/creation after man, but HAL exploited his own intelligence to kill his own creator, like men use their powers to kill God by killing the spirit of God that lives in their hearts, the spirit of God being the emotions, the feelings, love, compassion, everything that separate us from animals. I've always considered the relationship between Dave and HAL as an allegory of our humanity, and that's what makes the movie so depressing and pessimistic, our humanity is characterized by our intelligence, a double-edged sword, and our feelings so useless (in Dave's situation) when compared to the cold and monolithic death, this duality, feelings and intelligence is what makes things happen whereas death is nothing but nothingness and immobility, and unfortunately, it's the only certitude (even the existence of God is debatable)The movie is an invitation to contemplate a death-like world that would strongly remind us of our human condition, it's a quest for an unreachable immortality, because as powerful as we are, we can't become God, like HAL failed to become the only Master of the Vessel, becoming a machine is renouncing to our feelings, which is the key for self-destruction and annihilation of the humanity, and feelings are as useless as a drop of water in the desert of fate, Dave lived a long time but ultimately died. But as useless as feelings are and as dangerous as intelligence is, they're our most precious assets, what characterizes us the most as human, we can't become God, we can't become machines, we're only humans and our future is nothing less than our origins, our quest for immortality lead us to reconsider our conditions as mortal, but also highlights our miraculous condition as living creatures, life is a miracle, death implies life and vice versa, the beautiful shot of the fetus at the end invites us to forget about our individual death but think of us as an 'immortal' species, as an extraordinary civilization that reached immortality through intelligence combined with feelings  culture, ideas, arts, creations, beauty and Universality. The key of Immortality is Universality, to think of ourselves as humans, not as individuals since the Creator is the only immortal individuality, we can become God-like only as a collectivity, as the Humanity, Creator of its own Civilization.The movie is a masterpiece, one of the most intelligent and probably the most universal films ever made, (why intelligent? because it makes so many points with a few dialogs and action) but it is victim of its own greatness because Kubrick couldn't make his point in a different way, he's a great director and found the right tone, and the perfect visuals ... that's why I felt bored so many times, Death is a hypnotically scary immensity of nothingness, the movie had a hypnotic beauty, was thrilling and scary during the HAL's sequence, was immense by its dimension, beauty and philosophical value and many times, there was just emptiness, nothing special happened, because that's the way it is, sometimes, nothing DOES happen and in death, nothing will ever happen. The point of the movie, was its strength and its strength was its weakness. There are so many beautiful shots in this film, so many stunning sequences, an incredible score, but it was impossible for the movie to be so universally intelligent and entertaining in the same time.The Beauty of 2001 is like men's intelligence, a double edged sword, and its genius is as unreachable as immortality... all I can say is that I get it, but I can't get it.

I had read the first four books, loved every single one of them, and I was eagerly anticipating seeing one of my favorite world's come to life on the big screen. I was not disappointed. It remains, to date, one of the best cinema going experiences of my life.Nine years later, I decided to rewatch it, unsure if, after all these years and subsequent installment, my enjoyment would be diluted. Thankfully, that was not the case. While The Sorcerer's Stone may not have been the magical experience it was when I first saw it, it was nonetheless entertaining, sometimes inspired, usually engaging, and fast moving.One of the things that struck me about this film was the production design. Stuart Craig, who remained production designer throughout the series, is masterful in bringing the wonderful world of Harry Potter to life. From the bustling streets of Diagon Alley, to the autumn-colored, medieval halls of Hogwarts, Craig terrifically brings this alternate world to life.Most of the adult actors are quite good. Robbie Coltrane gives arguably the best performance as Hagrid, the deeply-caring gamekeeper who treats Harry almost like a surrogate son. Even when he's doing wrong, like hatching dragon eggs, you still root and sympathize for him. Richard Harris is also wonderful as the (mostly) soft-spoken and strong-hearted Albus Dumbledore. It is saddening that he only got to play the role in two movies and we never got the chance to see him evolve his character to the finale. You also have Fiona Shaw and Richard Griffiths are quite funny in their over-the-top performances as the Dursleys. Alan Rickman oozes contempt as Severus Snape, the lone teacher who can't stand Harry. And Dame Maggie Smith lets everyone know who's in charge as the stern Professor McGonagall.The cast of children are sometimes hit-and-miss, but overall there are more hits. Daniel Radcliffe usually makes a compelling lead as Harry Potter, although there are a couple of points where he seems to be just making sure he gets out his lines. Likewise, Rupert Grint (as best mate Ron Weasley) has a little trouble playing off other characters, although his comic timing is usually good. Emma Watson is not afraid to show off as the bossy, sometimes pretentious, but ultimately clever and well-intended Hermione Granger. She tends to get the best bits of comedy in the film; I laughed the hardest when, after Harry breaks a rule that could lead to his expulsion, Watson mutters with pure pretentious contempt, What- an- idiot. One other child actor who makes a good, evil impression is Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy. I need not mention how much of a shock it was seeing all of these actors so young after watching them in The Half-Blood Prince!Steven Kloves wrote the script, and while I wish he had let some scenes last longer, he makes up for that by trying to keep focus on the characters in Hogwarts and inserting a good amount of humor into the film. Kloves, probably trying to ensure he could please as many book readers as possible, sticks close to the original text, and that leads to both good and not-so-good traits of the film. While there are plenty of random pleasures, the direction of the story doesn't become very clear until halfway through.Chris Columbus would not have been my first choice for director but he holds his own here. He clearly takes a great interest into the sheer wonder of the world of magic, and he strikes many tones correctly in the picture, from comic (anything with the Dursleys), to horrific (in the Forbidden Forest), and to emotive (the first encounter with the Mirror of Erised, one of the rare scenes that feels as long as it should). Still, some scenes leave more of a punch to be desired. When poor Neville Longbottom accidentally goes veering into walls on a broomstick, Columbus doesn't perfectly capture how absurd it it that Madam Hooch's reaction is for him to somehow come back down on his own will. No wonder J.K. Rowling had Terry Gilliam as one of her first choices for director.Two other quibbles significantly bring down the picture. The first is a plot inconsistency. Voldemort is apparently a name that is so feared, people say You-Know-Who instead. However, these same character tend to quickly proceed to say Voldemort anyway. I'm kind of surprised Columbus, Kloves, and editor Richard Francis Bruce somehow missed this. Second, the special effects, while usually effective, sometimes get too herky-jerky, particularly during the Quidditch game.Still, those are minor to what I consider to be the greatest strength of The Sorcerer's Stone... THE SCORE! John Williams perfectly captures all of the appropriate feelings of the film, molding the music into becoming integral to the storytelling itself. No doubt Williams would have won the Oscar had it not been for Howard Shore's also brilliant score to the first Lord of the Rings film. Frequently while watching this film, I found myself simply listening to the picture, allowing John's score to carry me through the scene. I strongly believe that had his score not been in this film, my score would be a 7 and not an 8.So there you have it. While Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is probably not the best installment in the Harry Potter series, it is nonetheless effective. There's good acting, great production design, fantastic visuals, funny comedy, a great deal of wonder, and all sorts of other things that make this an entertaining and fast-moving film. The sense of joy I got back in 2001 isn't there anymore, but there's still pleasure, and that's good enough.

Kloves, probably trying to ensure he could please as many book readers as possible, sticks close to the original text, and that leads to both good and not-so-good traits of the film. While there are plenty of random pleasures, the direction of the story doesn't become very clear until halfway through.Chris Columbus would not have been my first choice for director but he holds his own here. He clearly takes a great interest into the sheer wonder of the world of magic, and he strikes many tones correctly in the picture, from comic (anything with the Dursleys), to horrific (in the Forbidden Forest), and to emotive (the first encounter with the Mirror of Erised, one of the rare scenes that feels as long as it should). Still, some scenes leave more of a punch to be desired. When poor Neville Longbottom accidentally goes veering into walls on a broomstick, Columbus doesn't perfectly capture how absurd it it that Madam Hooch's reaction is for him to somehow come back down on his own will. No wonder J.K. Rowling had Terry Gilliam as one of her first choices for director.Two other quibbles significantly bring down the picture. The first is a plot inconsistency. Voldemort is apparently a name that is so feared, people say You-Know-Who instead. However, these same character tend to quickly proceed to say Voldemort anyway. I'm kind of surprised Columbus, Kloves, and editor Richard Francis Bruce somehow missed this. Second, the special effects, while usually effective, sometimes get too herky-jerky, particularly during the Quidditch game.Still, those are minor to what I consider to be the greatest strength of The Sorcerer's Stone... THE SCORE! John Williams perfectly captures all of the appropriate feelings of the film, molding the music into becoming integral to the storytelling itself. No doubt Williams would have won the Oscar had it not been for Howard Shore's also brilliant score to the first Lord of the Rings film. Frequently while watching this film, I found myself simply listening to the picture, allowing John's score to carry me through the scene. I strongly believe that had his score not been in this film, my score would be a 7 and not an 8.So there you have it. While Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is probably not the best installment in the Harry Potter series, it is nonetheless effective. There's good acting, great production design, fantastic visuals, funny comedy, a great deal of wonder, and all sorts of other things that make this an entertaining and fast-moving film. The sense of joy I got back in 2001 isn't there anymore, but there's still pleasure, and that's good enough.

My personal experience with the latter is very limited. I've only seen one complete episode from the TV show, part of an older Flipper movie, and clips of others in the saga about a kid named Sandy and his best buddy, an unnaturally intelligent (even for his species) and charming dolphin. But my experiences are enough to tell you that the core elements and spirit of the show are incorporated into this big-screen version. It's another story about a boy and his (insert animal species). And although the movie's adult star Paul Hogan commands the most interesting character, the dolphin is charming enough to recommend the movie.In this picture, Sandy (Elijah Wood) is Porter Ricks's nephew (not son as in the show) and is reluctantly sent to his uncle's seaside home for a summer after a (what else?) divorce. Sandy is all but willing to accept his three months living by the ocean until a dolphin separated from its clan following a trigger-happy boater's tirade decides to stop by his favorite pier. Sandy, of course, forms a friendship with the dolphin, whom he names Flipper. And in the end, just like with Free Willy, the plot leads up to a struggle to reunite Flipper with his kin.This big-screen version of Flipper is a little flimsy and it's more whimsical than it is consistent. And just like with Free Willy, Lassie, Old Yeller, and every other cute critter in these kind of stories, Flipper has the ability to read minds, understand English, and run an underwater bank all without any training (Confused? See the movie). But honestly, I think that is part of the appeal that the TV show had for children and that's why I think that appeal will remain for this movie. Even for this adult, these whimsical and rather implausible adventures and tactics were packed with charm and the nostalgia they stirred up was rather enamoring. Yes, a better movie would be made if they tried to make a more realistic boy-and-dolphin story. How woul a *real* dolphin from the wild react to such a situation and how would an ordinary kid not under the control of movie conventions respond? And of course it'd be better if we didn't have a hokey backstory of toxic waste and an evil hammerhead shark named Scar? Wait? Scar? A shark named Scar? Okay now, Scar is a compelling name for an evil lion or even a Comanche war chief, but a hammerhead shark? The shark is not a good villain here. It's mouth is way too small to communicate menace, the moaning sounds it makes (an impossibility for real sharks) is phony, and the special effects used to simulate it are not sufficient.But who cares? What do we expect in a Flipper movie? A cute dolphin, a simple story, and a lot of whimsical under and out-of-water adventures. We get 'em. And there are some more magical moments, such as a very splendid little sequence where Flipper swims through the depths and explores the marvels of underwater life. The underwater nature photography is quite pleasing. And although Flipper does not do anything that we haven't seen him (or Free Willy, for that matter) do before, he is quite a good-looking and charming character on the screen. But ironically, it is Paul Hogan who carries the movie along when Flipper is not on-camera. Because even though the star, Elijah Wood, is as fine an actor for this part as anyone, he doesn't have anything to do that makes him stand out as a character. His change of mood over the course of the picture, dialogue, and attitude all are familiar. So when he starts to lose our interest, it is Paul Hogan who saves the day. He just has an enormous amount of on-screen charm and charisma with all of his costars. Even the movie's most ardent detractors will agree with that.Bottom line, even though I had a lot of mixed reactions, I did modestly enjoy this Flipper movie. It's not, I say, on par with Free Willy but as far as movies about a young, troubled kid and his cetacean best friend go, this one does alright. Paul Hogan is the best element in the picture, but the dolphin is charming enough to make it worth recommending. It is best seen with young children, for it will engage them (as it did me when I was younger) and charm parents as well. And adults who grew up with the TV show will be pleased at the same time.

It's actually pretty gloomy and dark and not what I would consider a musical (thought it has songs), making it the first straight up adventure story since 101 Dalmatians, with whom it shares a lot of similarities. However, this film stumbles where that one shone in terms of compelling characters and effective story arcs.The animation is pretty standard fare for the period, with the bothersome scratchy xerox lines of the 60s-80s, but the swampy backgrounds are very lovely and atmospheric. Medusa is particularly well animated, a farewell performance by the great Milt Kahl. The scenes where the mice are following the alligators to the showboat lair and in the pipe organ strike me as especially dynamic sequences. I would almost think they were computer aided- they have that feel of movement. The oil paintings at the beginning were quite moody and atmospheric, but they didn't hash as well as I would have liked with the rest of the movie, plus the whole sequence was kinda creepy and put a glum cast on the film from the outset.The characters- By far the best in the movie are Bernard and Bianca. Eva Gabor is charming and Bob Newhart makes this quirky, superstitious mouse come to life. The bayou animals served absolutely no purpose to the story- the film could have been made quite easily without their presence and been a lot more enjoyable and less juvenile for it. Penny is just too absowutewy adowable to her own good. From the sticky-sweet lispy voice to the bouncy pigtails and gap tooth, she's just an overdose of goo-goo.

I take it back, the entire cast of villains are to blame. Medusa seems at first pretty dangerous and loopy- very much like Cruella but a little broader. But as the movie goes on, her menace gives way to general incompetence. Once the true danger of the cave is done, she is so comically defeated, it kills any credible menace. The same goes for the crocodiles, who at first were an imposing presence of danger, but you eventually got the feeling they were incapable of harming anything even if they tried. Mr. Snoops, well as the odious comic relief, he was a waste from every angle, being neither terribly funny nor particularly villainous. The music is quite dated, having a particularly strong 70s easy-listening flavour which helps ground the film in a solid setting, I just happen to have a distaste for that style. The songs, with the exception of the Rescue-Aid Pledge are all sung off-screen by Shelby flint as some kind of ethereal narrator.

Well, hard to say.... it's a kind of thriller with some scary horrific sequences (the murders are actually extremely gross and violent, even for nowadays viewers who had to deal with Passion of the Christ for example), it has some documentary ambitions but it lacks social and psychological characters development (none's background is ever explained at any time, especially our infiltrated cop Steve Burns (Pacino)), it's a detective story but director Friedkin used so many twists and turns and style variations (the killer never has the same face...) to try to make a point that viewers might feel disappointed by this aspect as well...Not to mention that gay and straight viewers might feel offended by the choice of showing a few people of the gay community exposed to so many stereotypes  the shy-intellectual-writer-wannabe who won't take a stand, the arrogant blond Apollo, the bunch of leather S&M night wolves, the perverted cops (great opening scene with Joe Spinell and Mike Starr), the two travesty hookers, the sex-crazed hustler, the disturbed student obsessed by a omnipotent father's figure... all of 'em shown either as uncompetitive victims or hungry attackers.As I write this down, I recollect a funny detail from the film  the only person that we're shown getting laid (and getting it pretty much the hard way) is ... the only female character, Steve Burns's soft and gentle girlfriend, Nancy (played by cute and discreet Karen Allen). Well, Hollywood never had any problem to show heterosexuals having sex on screen, anyway.All of this create an unbalanced feeling of a whole cast and crew who don't know where they're going, trying to create ambiguity where the audience would need transparency (is Burns the killer ? Did he achieve his inner journey at the end ? Why is Nancy wearing the leather outfit ?) but it is always interesting to watch such a great missed opportunity by a -back then- great director in such a powerful story.So failed... but so much more enjoyable to watch as a guilty pleasure than 90% of today's productions.

Without any thoughts of self-righteousness or shred of greed from taking advantage of Lenny's size, strength and lack of social skills.Scene starts out with the two of them running from the Law, and end up going cross country to Salt Lake City Utah. The year was back in the mid to late 30's back when the Great Depression was still felt and jobs were limited.The biggest thrill I get from movies like this is its like going back in time to when things such as autism and other mental conditions were still misunderstood. In the movie you get a real since on how things were back then. From the Greyhound bus strip to working in the wheat fields with the wheat thresher. A time where Television hasn't even reached parts of the country such as this.As far as the two characters Lenny played by John Malkovich and George played by Gary Sinise both bring a certain freshness to the story. This movie has been made a number of times and its a relief to see how this story plays out through new actors. John brings an excellent performance in the kind, strong man known as Lenny. A man that understands very little in the world around him, and still have the kindness and gentle heart that is rare in such a man.George Melton played by Gary Sinis balanced out the duel in a most interesting way. Though Lenny was quiet and didn't speak much, he always had George there to guide him in the right direction. George on the other hand wasn't as big or as strong as Lenny but a made up for it in by helping Lenny in areas that wasn't as easy. The bond the two had remind me of two brothers, two men that understood each other. Both having a lack of skills but together working as a team. The movie over all was pretty well made, the picture was fantastic. Music was well written, and the scenes were well blended. I've watched the movie at least three times since it came out and every time I watch it there are some scenes that i still cant watch.

In particular I'd like to draw attention to Bond's showdown with Necros, the ice-cool blonde killer with the exploding milk bottles and deadly headphones wire.Along with the brutal and claustrophobic fistfight with Red Grant in 'From Russia With Love', this is my favourite Bond hand-to-hand combat scene, and one of the best scenes in the entire franchise. I just can't see how our hero could be in a worse situation hanging out of the back of a plane at two thousand feet, fighting for his life while holding on to a net filled with bags of opium, the guy ropes fraying and a bomb counting down somewhere inside. God knows my job has its bad days but nothing like this! It's thrilling stuff, and Timothy Dalton carries the scene beautifully. He really looks like he's in pain when Necros is throttling him with the netting, and when he finally gets the upper hand he shows no mercy. In fact he absolutely relishes the kill, cutting his bootlaces bit by bit as the helpless Necros begs for mercy. After all, this is the guy that's been killing off Bond's colleagues; sending him freefalling to the ground far below, Bond looks down with a sense of grim satisfaction. Justice has been done. It's masterful.I can see why many people prefer the more light-hearted Bond films and I have time for all of his incarnations; however for me Dalton's efforts are among my very favourites and I wish he'd had the chance to do a couple more. He's very intense and pretty brutal - especially in the follow-up 'Licence To Kill' - but still stylish and cool, in a way they've perhaps lost with Daniel Craig, much as I like him. In particular Dalton wears his clothes very well, looking equally comfortable in Afghan dress or a tux.

So in scene after scene, what could have had a film noir or gangster edge ends up strained in a more normal dramatic way. The script might be one of the problems--some forced metaphors about death, or canned lines that are too profound for their own good.But these are not the only problems here. The direction, I suppose, under Abraham Polonsky, is the reason it has an odd flow to it. (This is his only film of note.) Many decisions seem steadily mediocre, like having Morse do voiceovers that aren't quite styling enough to work as style and are a slow way of telling the events. Morse is connected with an overly sweet girl who isn't really his type and romance doesn't make sense. And there are some editing gaffes that don't help. Larger still, this is an impersonal plot, with no clear protagonist or antagonist, just a numbers racket that is being undermined by some unseen politicians and some gangsters who aren't quite sure what's going on (really--even Morse is lost).Beatrice Pearson plays Morse's girl, and it's sad to say she just can't act at the same level as Garfield, and many of the other bit actors. But Morse's brother played by Thomas Gomez is a strong and sympathetic type, and he pulls off several amazing scenes. The camera-work is smart and generally intense enough, with high or low angles at key points, if sometimes a little obvious. The city (Manhattan) is a good backdrop, giving it a very nice ambiance, both night and day.Well, the movie has an outsized reputation.

The very beginning with Girl in the Red Dress, as well as the scene where Curley's Wife is first introduced, and the conversation George has with Slim about their previous home, builds up this ominous shadow that stands just above George, Lenny, and Candy's dream. All of the characters have their own problem and their own story. Curley's Wife has no one to talk to, and uses her body to try coax the ranch hands into a simple conversation. Candy is coerced into letting one of the other workers put down his dog because the dog is worthless; he knows that because he is near worthless to the other workers he will have to be put down as well. Both of these characters, although not main characters, nor the best examples, really show Steinbeck's view of the human condition.One thing that surprised me in this movie was the soundtrack. I am a music major and always take note of great soundtracks, but this one baffled me. Usually directors use their soundtracks to create a more emotional pull into scenes or to grab the viewer's attention. This movie's lack of a soundtrack, in my opinion, made it better. The acting and writing, was enough to keep my attention held from start to finish.This movie is an intense experience; it will pull you in from the very beginning, and not let go until hours after you have finished watching it.

The very beginning with Girl in the Red Dress, as well as the scene where Curley's Wife is first introduced, and the conversation George has with Slim about their previous home, builds up this ominous shadow that stands just above George, Lenny, and Candy's dream. All of the characters have their own problem and their own story. Curley's Wife has no one to talk to, and uses her body to try coax the ranch hands into a simple conversation. Candy is coerced into letting one of the other workers put down his dog because the dog is worthless; he knows that because he is near worthless to the other workers he will have to be put down as well. Both of these characters, although not main characters, nor the best examples, really show Steinbeck's view of the human condition.One thing that surprised me in this movie was the soundtrack. I am a music major and always take note of great soundtracks, but this one baffled me. Usually directors use their soundtracks to create a more emotional pull into scenes or to grab the viewer's attention. This movie's lack of a soundtrack, in my opinion, made it better.
