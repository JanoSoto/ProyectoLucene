I don't like these shorter one word film titles though.The film kicks off with the handing over of the Enterprise from Kirk to a new younger crew. You half expected the next generation crew to be at the hand over but not so. Shatner looks uncomfortable in this sequence (in my opinion), it does seem as if he would be quite happy to carry on being the immortal space legend Kirk. It seems like a painful break for him and the original cast members that join him...Doohan and Koenig.The same could be said for myself as a viewer, I've never been a Trekkie but I have always enjoyed the original cast. This new film starts off well and in familiar territory with the beloved Kirk Scotty and Chekov under pressure, but it quickly falls flat as we hesitantly hand over to the new duller greyer crew.The problem with the new generation is quite simply the new crew, Jesus they are bland! so very boring, the only character I think has some interest is Worf. A Klingon male that has joined Starfleet and worked up the ranks, could almost be seen as a turncoat to his Klingon people, interesting.Other characters in the film are all rather meek and uninteresting. McDowell's character isn't really very threatening and fails to crank up the tension when on screen, hardly a villain to remember. I must also admit I always hated Goldberg in Star Trek, she just seemed to big a name to have involved plus she really doesn't fit this type of genre if you ask me.Other personal issues I have with this film and the new crew is the character of Data. A tremendously annoying character that looks like a makeup mistake, terrible effects when we do see his innards and whose humorous moments are rather forced and cringeworthy. His whole development during this film are along the same lines as Kryten from British sci-fi comedy 'Red Dwarf'...yet not as good I might add. Of course my opinions are personal preference within the Star Trek universe.Anyway the plot is pretty dull frankly, an odd choice of adventure, at least up until the Nexus takes Picard whilst part of the Enterprise crashes (film highlight borrowed from 'Star Trek III' perhaps?). Things do get a little more interesting then especially as we get Kirk back. Still many questions arise during these sequences, what exactly is the Nexus? an afterlife of some kind? where does it come from? how does it work? etc...How come Picard can see and talk to Guinan? and how come Kirk had only just arrived there despite him entering the Nexus 78 years prior? Lastly, how come they can both simply decide to leave the Nexus to where ever they wish?Maybe I missed these points I dunno but luckily it doesn't detract from the fun of having Kirk and Picard double up in a pretty cool franchise generation cross over. Alas they still decide to kill off Kirk which I think is a mistake because he and his classic crew got a bloody good send off in 'Star Trek VI'. Seeing as he gets killed here you tend to think the character would deserve yet another royal send off with a big military funeral attended by all previous characters in a special episode or another film. Seems an anti- climax to just leave it at this after all that has gone before.As for the effects well of course they look sharper and bolder but most of the shots were CGI created with only a few models used. For me this is a shame and adds to the shiny plastic fake look of the film just like its TV counterpart, models always look better. The whole film did feel very much like an outstretched TV episode, more so than previous film offerings if you ask me. Like I said the plot is thin and could easily have been a simple episode (seeing as the effects aren't exactly much different). There really was no big silver screen stand out moment, the space battle against the Klingon sisters was quite good but that's all you get.Overall I think this was a disappointing start for the next generation of Star Trek films. I admit it was always gonna be a hard sell to me as I never followed Star Trek after the original crew and never liked the next gen cast\/crew. Despite that its still a very mediocre entry with a lot of dialog which could almost be construed as time wasting of sorts.Seeing Kirk and Picard together was damn good I have to say. Seeing the Shat back in action in the finale despite weight and age really puts a smile on your face, Trek fan or not. Lets not forget it was a three way battle including McDowell, that's a pretty awesome trio of legends duking it out right there folks. Just a shame the rest of the film didn't live up to the action and excitement in the finale. It took the inclusion of Shatner to bring that excitement I might add, that tells you something.5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"26 January 2015","score":"","review":" A new film, a new generation and the beginning of a newer franchise.

I did always enjoy the films with the original classic crew but never got into any of the TV series, especially the new stuff. I always preferred the Star Wars franchise for many reasons but mainly because it always looked so superior in virtually every department. This first Trek movie really does show the difference between the two franchises which both appeared in the same era, not taking anything away from Star Trek but it always did look more fake and plastic looking.The effects in this first movie are a mixed bag really. The sequences towards the finale inside V'Ger don't look too bad (nice 2001-esque fantasy lighting effects), various spaceship shots look nice throughout and the costumes although drab don't age too badly. For the most part this film has aged badly if we're brutally honest about it, I don't wanna keep comparing it to Star Wars but there is a clear difference in quality which still stands to this day.What I did always like about Trek was the way it tries to be realistic or at least approach things in a realistic fashion. I'm Not sure if they are merely homaging or copying '2001' but you can clearly see the influences in one sequence as we are treated to a grandiose panorama of the Enterprise as she sits in her docking bay accompanied by a stirring Trek instrumental score. This epic approach is a far cry from the flashbang blaster fire and roaring starcruisers of a certain George Lucas affair. Star Trek is definitely aiming at the grown-ups here, the real sci-fi enthusiasts who name Kubrick's space opus as their holy bible...which Wise clearly did too.I do like the way Wise gave the film a slow pace. Lots of character and background building alongside plenty of mission dialog and technical problems that might occur in reality for such a scenario. Its all classic Star Trek as you would remember from the original series but on a sexier scale with props that actually do look kinda real. In fact there's even more politically correct...goody two- shoes...prime directive...Federation type babble than you can wave a stick at, and Shatner loves his speeches.The film was criticised for this slow unadventurous style but personally I like it, its one of the more realistic Trek movies offering exactly what you got with the original TV series...but prettier. I still to this day don't really understand why some folk (even Trek fans) don't like it. The main aspect of this film I like is the plot, yes the plot. Seems straight forward enough as the team are sent to intercept a mysterious alien phenomena heading towards earth, but I liked how the plot has its intriguing twist at the end. Again just like the classic show you get the danger and mystery with a cute little twist to keep you on your toes. Its not groundbreaking but it just makes you think a little, right up to the very end you're unsure what the hell will happen. How Kirk will save the day and what's the deal behind the alien cloud thing, that's good story telling right there methinks.The continuity from the TV show to the big screen was handled well I thought although I'm no Trek expert. You have all the crew doing what they are best at of course, some new crews members (redshirt fodder perhaps?), plenty of well known typical Trek visuals and sounds, the crew handle most of the action from the ships bridge via the good old big screen on the wall and the Enterprise looks slick with a bit of spit n polish to tart it up for the big screen.Sure its not an in your face phaser fest with hand to hand fights against large lizard men but I for one thought the serious route was a good way to go. The film is more of an exploration adventure, it takes its time, slowly builds up, lots of space jargon...you don't know what their on about half the time but it just sounds good...I use my realism card again. It feels like a point n click strategic adventure game for your PC...I guess?One of the oddest things when you think about it was the fact Wise directed this. You tend to remember Robert Wise for the Hollywood epics 'The Sound of Music' and 'West Side Story' which are two of the greatest musicals ever made probably. So its kinda funny to think he directed the first Star Trek movie, then again he did direct 'The Andromeda Strain' and 'The Day the Earth Stood Still' so he did have some good sci-fi experience.Overall the special effects look fuzzy in places, lots of beige colour schemes going on with the ship and crew, plenty of nasty bluescreen evident I'm afraid...but its still very enjoyable sci-fi. Star Trek has its own little niche of being semi-serious and approaching everything logically but still utilising just enough fantasy to make it a charming pleasant ride.7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"26 January 2015","score":"","review":" To think this this film came out when I was just one year old, just like Star Wars which came out a year before I was born, makes me think...my God Jim...I'm old!I've never been a huge Star Trek fan and never will be in all honesty.

Well not to beat around the bush no it doesn't, its a full strike if you ask me.I'm not gonna sugar coat it, gotta be cold here. For me this was easily the weakest Trek film so far, even worse than 'Star Trek V'. I know I have used the term 'outstretched TV episode' a few times in previous reviews with Star Trek but this one term really sums up this film to a tee.Apart from the quite dreadful grey scale shaded tone that accompanies every scene on board the Enterprise which somehow now seems more intrusive than in the previous two films, the plot is utterly non-engaging or even remotely interesting. A planet which harbours immortal regeneration powers that Starfleet and the alien race Son'a wish to keep for themselves whilst at the same time evicting the local hippie population. Say what now?? yes that's right, its basically all about evicting some perfect happy go lucky boring blonde haired blue eyed farm folk off their planet...and that's it. I'm not even sure if there were any bad guys in this! I suppose they were naughty, not really much of a threat though, it was just a few groups fighting amongst themselves really, nothing more.The whole film is so so utterly pointless and dull for virtually the entire run time! It only kicks into action for a small segment near the finale and even that was very mediocre stuff. Everything looks exactly as it does on the TV show, there is nothing that would make you think this is a big budget movie. The effects are no better! you would think they might be getting better but no, this film actually goes a step backwards.There is just something about the next generation design, even though these are movies they just can't seem to shake the look and feel of the TV series. The classic crew movies didn't always look tremendous but they were always much better looking than the original show, they always had real silver screen moments. I'm afraid to say this entry has none what so ever.It seems as though everything is now fully CGI here, I'm not a fan of computer generated effects and I think this is a good example why.

There is also no explanation for Nimbus III, its inhabitants, its name (the planet of galactic peace?), why there are horses from Earth on it and why exactly everyone is on Sybok's side.

Thusly we have the mysterious Laurence Luckinbill who just happens to look very much like Sean Connery with a beard. I mean really Shatner...OK you wanted Connery and he said no, you didn't have to use another actor that looked like a poor mans Sean Connery, surely it wasn't that necessary.Of course the main issue here is the fact they all run off looking for God at the centre of the galaxy. Personally I really can't think of a more risky idea than this! apart from possibly alienating a huge amount of the audience who will have their own religious views and beliefs that are sure to conflict. The flip side is you know straight away they won't actually find God as how could a sci-fi film proclaim what God would look, sound or behave like.

As discussed in my review the first film really did have an epic feel to it with some beautifully sweeping model shots, but this fifth entry really does look dire. As usual we get more dodgy looking bluescreen shots and yet more hokey looking shaky sets which I have come to accept (sign of the franchise I'm afraid).

","genre":"Western"},{"date":"26 January 2015","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" The Story of GI Joe is a biography &#x96; and almost feels like a documentary &#x96; of the famous US World War II correspondent Ernie Pyle (played by Burgess Meredith) as he covers the gritty exploits of Company C of the US 18th Infantry. The director, William Wellman, based the movie upon Pyle's Pulitzer Prize winning book. Pyle was a rare breed. He insisted on being on the front lines with our GIs so as to get the right account of what was really happening with the average Joe. His purpose was not to carry a weapon but to take notes and send true stories back home about young soldiers who expressed their fears and concerns, and who felt their way thorough their first combat. Pyle stuck with the soldiers through heavy rains, mud holes, flowing streams, and combat situations. Pyle's dispatches showed the home front parents what their boys were going through. Initially the slow-paced film begins in North Africa (February 1943) and covers the American reverse at the hands of the Axis forces of Field Marshall Rommel at the Kasserine Pass. After that it moves quickly over the American victories in Africa and the conquest of Sicily. Then the rest of the movie's focus is the war in Italy (up to the capture of Rome), especially the battles of San Vittorio and Mt. Cassino (a sixth century abbey). As for the latter, the Germans did not use its strategic position until it was bombed. But the rubble made them a favorable defensive position. The US soldiers &#x96; mechanics, construction men, office workers, etc. before the war &#x96; are well led by the humane Lt. Walker (Robert Mitchum).

He insisted on being on the front lines with our GIs so as to get the right account of what was really happening with the average Joe.

Quite simply the Borg are on the rampage and out to assimilate pretty much everyone they can, namely all of Starfleet. This goes a little pear shaped for them so they jump through time to assimilate the entire Earth...the naughty rascals. Is time travel a regular function for everyone in the Trek universe? handy if so.I liked this film for the simplicity of everything and the fact you get some basic action mixed with some genuine tension along with the insecurity of not knowing what may happen, seeing as its the Borg. Bottom line there are plenty of deaths or assimilation's (close enough), a decent baddie, some good back story to Earth's future and plenty of phaser action. Its not exactly a top notch sci-fi action flick lets be honest here, this is no Die Hard in space. Visually most things still have that TV show quality only on a slightly grander scale. Everything looks a bit plastic amongst the obvious plastic sets.Effects again are more CGI based than models unfortunately. The space battle against the big Borg cube ship thing at the start actually looks like a video game sequence, obvious CGI without weight or depth. I know this is still only 96 but geez you'd think they could do better, compare this to Star Wars! The deadly Borg look quite decent with some good facial makeup but their cyborg body armour, weapons and general body attachments do look pretty rubbery and plastic.I really don't know who decided to put silly little flashing lights all over the shop, it just makes everything look so childish and fake. Data again suffers with this indignity, when his android under layers are revealed it just appears to be bare grey plastic with stupid flashing fairy lights all over, so very crap looking.As for the bad guys I do like them, space zombies if you will, lets face it that's what they are really. Part robotic and part organic space zombies from the planet Romero. I do like the Borg as they do actually come across as creepy plus they manage to add real tension and dread to a Star Trek film. Can't really over look the fact they are a mixture of various ideas from various other sci-fi\/horror films all pieced together ('Hellraiser' springs to mind). Plus the fact that they transform whole areas into cold dead robotic hives that visually appear the same as the Borg themselves kinda copies ideas used in 'Aliens' but hey ho.Apart from that the Borg are quite a cool creation and do actually add a genuine threat to the Star Trek universe. Yet at the same time they kinda don't fit in the Trek universe, they're almost too cold, calculated and merciless for the family friendly franchise. Not sure I ever really liked the design of their ship (I guess its a ship), why is it merely a large cube? what's the deal with that? On a final note why are they called Borg? are they Swedish?The Borg queen is a nice touch to the faceless enemy that does come across as an interesting character, not just a cyborg on auto pilot. She also has some really good prosthetic makeup on the face and chest regions, looks that bit more realistic than the other drones.A definite improvement over the last rather dull film, a basic story which is more savage and quite dark in places, although not too extreme of course. I did notice this is another film where actually having some knowledge of a previous TV episode\/s is slightly required. They got away with it for 'Star Trek II' and I believe they got away with it for this film also, but seeing that particular episode would appear to help when watching this film.6\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"26 January 2015","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Second film (or sequel?) for the next generation crew and this time there is no hint of the classic crew what so ever, its all new now baby.So this next Trek rumble is a lot more straight forward plot wise and probably has the most action seen for awhile.

I had heard it was controversial but knew none of the details surrounding the complaints. As the film begins it gives a portrayal of Jesus as a tormented, self abusing, schizophrenic, lunatic of a man plagued by voices. He knows he is the chosen Messiah or Savior and hates God for making him be the One. In order to defy God and maybe make Him change His mind, Jesus makes crosses for the Romans to crucify his fellow countrymen on. Judas, an acquaintance of Jesus is a somewhat honorable man who is a political zealot wanting to break away from and overthrow Roman rule. As a side note, the only thing Biblically accurate about the story so far are the names of the characters nothing else. After Jesus was suddenly healed from the voices, he decides to follow God's will and complete his task (but to point out, he acts like a person with multiple personalities throughout the entire film). So he begins preaching, not out of divine inspiration as he has no relationship with God whatsoever, but simply to create a following and gain power, control, and a momentum for his cause. He makes up stories and has no wisdom or even any idea of what he is talking about. In the film he is depicted as a man who is on a spiritual journey himself, trying to get rid of his sin (when in reality he was sinless), trying to find his own way in the world, making up things and figuring it out as he goes. He even admits through the film that He does not know what he is doing or anything about the world. He changes his stance and worldview many times throughout the film sometimes preaching of love other times messages of hate, fear, anger, and violent revolution. He calls himself the Saint of Blasphemy and comes Not to bring peace but the sword. This reminds me of John 1247 where Jesus really proclaimed the complete opposite For I did not come to condemn the world, but to save it, and also in the garden when being arrested he stops the disciples from trying to defend him saying Put your sword back in its place... for all who draw the sword will die by the sword. Nothing in this matches up at all with the Jesus of the Bible. His sermons were half imagined by the writers and the other half were random phrases taken from the Bible and skewed into whatever they wanted to say. It was quite ridiculous in how out of context it all was. While Jesus was fully God and fully man, they wade him out to be a guy who one day just decided that he wanted God to make him a God. He was given a very arrogant personality and went around proclaiming that he was the Messiah which if you read the Gospels Jesus never does. The film was simply full of bad theology, unhistorical, inaccurate and completely in contradiction to Christian and Jewish ideals.The big turning point in the film was when Jesus comes down from the cross and lives his life out as a normal man ignoring God's plan which he was to fulfill. At this point I thought Now I definitely see why this is so controversial. It only got worse from there with the scenes of Paul the Apostle manipulating people, or the angelic child telling Jesus that There is only one woman in the world, one woman with many faces, this one falls and another one rises. If you stopped the film there, as I am sure many angry viewers did, you would be left with the impression that the film's message was Christianity is a farce. Up to this point it had turned me off and had me completely fooled and to my wonderful surprise a huge ingenious plot twist came up. I had been tricked just as Jesus had all along with the angelic child being Satan the whole time. This was Jesus' last temptation. It revealed that this was just an alternate reality Jesus was hashing out in his mind of what could have happened if he were to have left the cross.I am sure that most of the people who criticize this film are Christians who have never even seen it, but I would also argue that those who highly praise it have never heard the real story or failed to understand its meaning. It was good that it showed Jesus' human side but it was horribly inaccurate and deeply flawed story.As far as movie-making goes, I thought the acting was good, the directing fine, but the writing was terrible. The cinematography was wonderful with incredible imagery, especially the desert scenes. It was appealing to the eye and a beautiful work of art. One positive about the plot was that unlike Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ which focuses mainly on Jesus' torturous end, it tells the story (or at least attempted to) of his life which is why his murder was significant. The ending was brilliant and redeemed the film a little, but it was not enough. If only the first two thirds of the movie could have been as good as the ending.

It disrupted the problem is love problem of Henry. It becomes difficult to meet Henry that she is lying about her is noble that is much finer than the valet as she really is. She also lying about her name is Nicole de Lancret who is her mother's name. Since it is not acceptable that a prince marries a servant during the time it is set in, it becomes a problem when Henry and his parents discovers that Danielle's servant. The problem gets solved when Henry understands that he has power over himself because he is the prince and Fragrance X there fore Danielle if she wants to marry him. Danielle say yes and it will be a big wedding and and everyone will be happy, except Rodmilla and stepsisters who may start working as a connoisseur that Danielle was before.Cinderella's father was married to Cinderella's stepmother Rodmilla the Gent but died when he had a heart attack. She is very cruel to Danielle and treats her like a servant and not a daughter or someone in the family. Rodmilla also has two daughters named Marguerite and Jacqueline de Ghent who is very spoiled. Danielle's best friend named Gustave. They've been best friends since bard omen when Danielle often used to wrestle him in the mud so they both became dirty and wet. Gustave always helps Dannielle when she is in trouble and make her happy when she's sad.Danielle's inner qualities is that she's kind and think about how others feel. Her external qualities is that she is beautiful that makes Prince Henry immediately falls in love with her.Prince Henry is a typical teenager who has no plans to become king. He wants to explore the world outside the castle walls and can accommodate therefore often away, but a stolen horse and return to the castle when he feels like it. Henry is also the person in the film that goes through the biggest change of all. At the beginning of the film is Henry is not someone who thinks of others but only himself and the people he lives with. When he meets Danielle who is thinking very much about how others feel so Henry can not understand quite how she thinks. But the more they get hit Dannielle him think '' right ''. At the end of the film, he has become a very wise prince who thinks of others and not just yourself.My favorite person in the film is Leonardo Da Vinci for his help and is fun in the way he behaves. You also get to see another side of Leonardo Da Vinci, much more fun than what he thinks when he sees and his paintings in books and online.The film's ending is that Danielle has been captured by Le Pieu. Because her father taught her swordsmanship, she uses a sword, forcing Le Pieu to give her the key to his castle so she can get out of there. The film's end was as I expected so I did not get any special feeling. But the music during the movie was well suited to what happened so you got the feeling that you were there when it took place.Because there is always something new happening so it was never so bored in the movie that made the movie was better than expected. I would recommend the movie for those who want to see some other versions of the original films. What age you are, so suits the film. For adults, it can be fun to see a version of the movie they have seen so many times and for children it can fit to the holders of love, princesses, princes and castles.

At the same time a core group of New York cops are all over him and his gang, determined to go to war, whatever the cost, to bring him down which leads to a violent climax.In a break from the usual cops and robber movie the line between crook and cop are a little blurry here. Sure Walken's character is a crook who kills people and then goes to parties laden with cocaine and sex, but he kills other scum bags and tries to use his new found freedom to do good things for charity. He's a character who is using his empire as a means to do what he feels is the right thing and raise a poor community up from its poor roots.The cops on the other hand believe that a crook, will forever be a crook. As David Caruso's (CSI Miami joke here) character aptly puts, that the more people he kills the more it reflects badly on the cops whilst no matter what they do to stop Frank, he always gets away scot-free. I can definitely see the positives and negatives from both sides as they can be both as bad and both as justifiable in their actions. Really well thought out stuff when you think about it, and this was a film made 12 years before the Wire (which I've still got to finish watching).Though while I do say it's uneven I still hold to that. Some bits feel a little rushed in pacing and even the lawyer girlfriend to Frank White seems to vanish into thin air during the third act of the film.But despite being a low budget film, it is still a pretty good looking film with an impressive cast (including Lawrence Fishburn, Wesley Snipes and David Caruso) who play their parts really well. I did have a few niggling problems, mostly with the sound though that could attribute to the copy of the film I had. But the climax of this film is where it's really at as everything that has been building up to this comes to an exciting head.It's such a shame that this film has been so over looked, I mean I only really found out about it through Christopher Walken's film list.

But the climax of this film is where it's really at as everything that has been building up to this comes to an exciting head.It's such a shame that this film has been so over looked, I mean I only really found out about it through Christopher Walken's film list. It deserves a lot more credit.

If you think you know Gleason from TV, then this movie will enlighten to his amazing acting chops. Then there is Army, the loyal friend encapsulated perfectly by Mickey Rooney. And, lurking ringside, is a cabal of strong-arm thugs run by the scarily butch Ma Greeny (Madame Spivy).This was a bet -- not a bank loan, she sneers to Maish. The bundle -- and in cash -- by the first of the month! This film, based on a story by Rod Serling, crackles with wonderful dialog, pitch-perfect characterizations, and dusky black-and-white atmospherics.Made some eight years after Quinn's amazing performance in La Strada, this film features another powerful characterization by this powerhouse actor. Quinn perfectly captures the poignancy of a gentle giant who has never had much opportunity in life -- just a body that could take a pounding and rise to face another fight. This film raises important questions about whether one can ever truly transcend one's beginnings in this world -- or whether life's inexorable circumstances will drag one back into the mud.All you need to work with kids is instinct!

The story begins with a man named Porter (Mel Gibson). He's been double-crossed and left for dead. He was supposed to get $70,000 from a buddy of his after the two of them pulled off a daring robbery but his cash was taken from him and now, he wants it back. Trouble is that the man he's after, Val Rescnick (Gregg Henry) has been busy while he was recuperating. Now to get his money, which has been completely spent, he's going to have to go higher up than his former friend, he's going to have to tear down one mob higher-up after another. As you can imagine, the Mafiosos do not take kindly to his request.What works with the film is that while the story isn't necessarily all that revolutionary, there are some good twists throughout and the characters are memorable. I mean it in a good way when I say that the characters here are very broad and cartoonish, because every single character is that way. Porter is stubborn to the point of being psychotic. He insists on getting his money, no matter the cost. Personal loss? Injury? Who cares. It's all about getting his $70,000. No more, no less because that's what he is owed. It's the natural order of things for people to get what's coming to them, so if anyone gets in his way, then what they had coming to them was a bullet to the head. What I liked with our protagonist was that the movie doesn't wimp out and make him a thief that plays nice with children or has a soft spot and refuses to hit women or anything like that. The character is a real dirt bag. He's not above stealing from criminals or innocent people as long as it means getting closer to his goal. This is where the movie gets good because there are a ton of obstacles in Porter's way and each detour or change of plans brings in a new character that's a ton of fun to follow. Most of the guys we see Porter go up against are even more despicable than he is so you cheer for him when he blows them away or finds a way to get them out of his hair.In terms of secondary characters we've Porter's former partner Val. You don't like him because he's a fool and everyone around him knows it. Betraying your best friend to pay back a mob debt, just so you could get yourself into an even bigger mess? Not cool. Next we have some amateur gangsters that figure because everybody else is going after Porter, they're going to sneak in and nab 'em to make a good impression. David Paymer plays Arthur Stegman, a bottom-feeder who you enjoy seeing because you know he's in way over his head and eventually, he's going to realize it too... the hard way. Next are two corrupt cops, one of the biggest thorns in Porter's side. Their interactions with our hero prove that he is able to think quickly on his feet and these guys are so slimy they're a joy to watch. Finally we've got two fun female characters as well. A call girl named Rosie (Maria Bello) who proves to be one of the few allies Porter can find in this crazy story (but even then, can she really be trusted?) and we've got Lucy Liu as Pearl, a dominatrix that ends up getting the hots for our protagonist. The film is often very funny because everyone is so outlandish and you can never predict what kind of new and colorful thug is going to show up next to ruin Porter's day.Part of the fun of seeing Payback is getting this glimpse at a most seedy underground, but a lot of it is simply seeing a guy so determined to get what's his that he is willing to do anything. There are a lot of moments of tension as your mind races, wondering how our hero is going to get himself out of a jam and you even sweat for some of the bag guys, who are too taken aback by Porter's black-and-white view of the. My understanding is that the VHS version of the film is significantly different from the one that is available on Blu-ray and DVD but that just makes me excited to watch this film again and compare the two. If you happen to find this one at a garage sale or you have an old dusty box of tapes in your attic, dig it out and give it a shot. Once in a while you want a hero that isn't squeaky clean.

A call girl named Rosie (Maria Bello) who proves to be one of the few allies Porter can find in this crazy story (but even then, can she really be trusted?) and we've got Lucy Liu as Pearl, a dominatrix that ends up getting the hots for our protagonist. The film is often very funny because everyone is so outlandish and you can never predict what kind of new and colorful thug is going to show up next to ruin Porter's day.Part of the fun of seeing Payback is getting this glimpse at a most seedy underground, but a lot of it is simply seeing a guy so determined to get what's his that he is willing to do anything. There are a lot of moments of tension as your mind races, wondering how our hero is going to get himself out of a jam and you even sweat for some of the bag guys, who are too taken aback by Porter's black-and-white view of the. My understanding is that the VHS version of the film is significantly different from the one that is available on Blu-ray and DVD but that just makes me excited to watch this film again and compare the two. If you happen to find this one at a garage sale or you have an old dusty box of tapes in your attic, dig it out and give it a shot. Once in a while you want a hero that isn't squeaky clean. A guy that it turns out, did commit the murder he was thrown in jail for, but is the best man for the job so you're forced to go along with his adventures. When that's what you want, check out Payback because it delivers.

The two characters bump, trip and fall their way into romance. And, talk about chemistry &#x96; Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn have it in Bringing Up Baby. The entire cast shine in this wonderful RKO comedy. Katherine Hepburn is the frenetic Susan, and she nails the character beautifully. Cary Grant is a perfect model of an absent-minded professor. In this case, he's otherwise preoccupied most of the time. His Dr. David Huxley is the most unlikely match for Susan, but it works exceedingly well. Charles Ruggles is hilarious as Major Applegate. May Robson is ideal as Aunt Elizabeth. Virginia Walker plays Alice Swallow. She is the type of person one might expect a no-nonsense professor to have as a fiancé. On their honeymoon, they might label bones or search for fossils on the seashore. This was Walker's first movie and she didn't make another until 1945. She got bit parts in four films that year and then died at age 30 in 1946. Little information is available about her or the cause of her death. A newspaper notice said she died after a long illness. One of the funniest scenes in Bringing Up Baby is when Susan and David are in the restaurant. She accidentally rips the back of his suit jacket. Then he accidentally rips the back off her dress &#x96; exposing her girdle from behind. They hurry out of the restaurant, walking in step against one another, David in the back. The extras in the restaurant got a charge out of it as well. I don't see how a director could shoot such a scene as though the people around them wouldn't notice. Everyone must have had great laughs on the set that day. David has a line toward the end of the film that sums up their relationship. Now, it isn't that I don't like you, Susan, because after all, in moments of quiet, I'm strongly drawn towards you; but &#x85; well, there haven't been any quiet moments.For his short appearance in the film, Barry Fitzgerald is in one of the funniest short scenes. He plays Mr. Gogarty. Toward the end when the mayhem has many of the characters gathered in the jail house, Gogarty is ready to go fisticuffs and a big deputy just picks him up by the collar and seat of his pants &#x96; as if he were a sack of beans &#x96; and carries him into a cell.

Those who can take or leave musicals will probably split on their enjoyment of this one. But, stage and movie fans who love song and dance and the stories of musical plays will find great fun and enjoyment here. The Happiest Millionaire is a rollicking fun and entertaining musical. The Sherman Brothers &#x96; Richard and Robert, who gave us the music for Mary Poppins, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, and Winnie the Pooh wrote the dazzling score and a baker's dozen of songs. I couldn't find a credit anywhere for choreography, but whomever handled that chore did it superbly. There are several individual and small scenes with dance, but my favorite is the men's troupe in Clancy's Tavern. We see some excellent hoofing, hopping and singing perfectly matched and timed by a gang of men at the bar. All of the cast perform admirably. Tommy Steele plays John Lawless, the new butler who never has a job interview but finds himself quickly assimilated into the Biddle household. As a newly arrived immigrant from Ireland, Lawless narrates the story in snippets as it unfolds with him in it. He sings and dances to Fortuosity, which became a pop tune. The Mills Brothers featured it as the title track on an album in 1968. Others recorded the song over time, including Carol Burnett, Vic Damone, Count Basie and Nancy Sinatra. The rest of the cast are great matches. Fred MacMurray wasn't a Walt Disney regular by happenstance. MacMurray had more than three decades behind him as a leading man. He was one of the best male comedy leads of Hollywood's Golden Age. In 1943, he was the highest paid movie star in the world &#x96; not bad for someone who didn't go looking for a movie career. He was a versatile actor and he could sing and dance. MacMurray grew up in a musical family. His first years were playing saxophone and lead singing in orchestras and bands. He played in musicals on Broadway. He was a three-sport athletic star in high school, and he kept in good shape during all of his career. MacMurray was 59 years old when The Happiest Millionaire reached theaters. He was the perfect specimen (and actor) to play the role of Anthony Biddle who was 42 in 1916 when the movie takes place. Apparently, Paramount had sought several other women first, but now it's hard to imagine anyone other than Greer Garson as the mother, Cordelia Biddle. The Oscar-winner from Mrs. Miniver of 1942 had a wonderful record of movies and TV films. Lesley Ann Warren is excellent after her TV film success as Cinderella in 1965. She is Cordy whose coming out drives the plot that develops around Anthony's household. John Davidson was very good in song and dance and as Cordy's suitor. Geraldine Page is hilarious as Mrs. Duke. The rest of the cast shine as well. A.J. Carothers wrote the screenplay for this movie. He collaborated with the Sherman Brothers on many Disney projects. His source material was the stage play, The Happiest Millionaire, by Kyle Crichton, which was based on a book Crichton co-authored with Cordelia Drexel Biddle, My Philadelphia Father. She is the Cordy whom Warren plays in the film. While the movie is a musical and fiction, I was surprised to find out how much of its content and the main character, Father, were true to the real Anthony Biddle and the family. The Biddles were wealthy indeed. While Mr. Biddle didn't have to work &#x96; in fact, disdained being hemmed in by walls of an office, he couldn't be counted among the idle rich. He was an active, energetic man who gave his time to many good and worthwhile efforts. He boxed and trained his kids and many other people to box for fitness. He was renowned as the eccentric person that MacMurray portrays so well. He pursued theatricals, self-published various works, trained and taught athletics and Christianity, and had pet alligators. He founded the Athletic Christianity movement that grew to more than 300,000 members in time. Biddle had served in the U.S. Marine Corps, and he was an expert in close combat. He wrote manuals on the subject and trained Marines for both world wars, as well FBI agents. By the time this film came out, the allure of musicals had faded. It wasn't the big hit that Walt Disney had envisioned. He had started this project but died of cancer before it was finished. Still, it covered its costs at the box office. Occasional new musicals are done today, and they have an appreciative audience. So, The Happiest Millionaire will live on, as will other very good and great musicals of the past. I am particularly glad that I purchased the 2004 Disney release of the restored roadshow edition &#x96; and new longer version at 172 minutes. This is truly a film that the whole family will enjoy.
