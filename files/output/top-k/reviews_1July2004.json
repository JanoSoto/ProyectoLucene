It just keeps getting better and better no matter how many times you do it. You may get sick at the end from too much of it, but it's a fun ride while it lasted. A movie with just enough ice cream without getting sick is Bowfinger, a low-key comedy from the minds of on-off director Frank Oz (who's responsible for the genius Little Shop of Horrors and the idiotic The Stepford Wives) and the always great Steve Martin (well, not always great-he was in Cheaper by the Dozen). It's always on key, en route to greatness, and barely gets bogged down by sentimentality.Bobby Bowfinger (Martin) is a filmmaker who has fallen on hard times. He has a few constant actors at his helm, including Carol (Christine Baranski) and Dave (Jamie Kennedy). He gets a script for a horror movie called Chubby Rain, and is able to make it if they can get huge action star Kit Ramsey (Eddie Murphy) in the picture. Kit refuses, but Bowfinger and co. film around Kit so he doesn't even know he's in it. Kit has his own mental troubles, including delusions of paranoia and exposing himself to the Lakers cheerleaders. Meanwhile, Kit look-alike Jif (also Murphy) is hired for a stand-in. Of course, things soon get out of hand.Put simply, Bowfinger is a hilarious movie. Martin hits a home run again with this movie. Considering he wrote it also, he knew exactly how to do each line, and his almost dead-pan performance fit into the humor of the role. Murphy plays two very different roles here, both to perfection. Kit is almost like Chris Rock in one of his movies, while Jif is at the completely different end of the spectrum. He's a low-key guy, and Murphy did a great job with that character. All of the other actors added to the humor of the script. There's not really much more to say about Bowfinger except that it's very funny. And that's all I have to say about that.My rating 8\/10Rated PG-13 for sex-related material and language.

Brief summary Eastwood plays a retired FBI profiler who has had a heart transplant and gets called out of retirement to solve the murder of the young woman whose heart he now uses. Eastwood is famous in the business for making films quickly and under budget and in this movie it shows. There were moments when I thought, 'surely there must have been more than one take of this?' Eastwood even stumbles over a phrase and they still used the take. According to the lore, Eastwood tells the actors to do a scene, assuring them they're just rehearsing or that he's merely adjusting the focus. The actors then do a relaxed take and then Eastwood says, 'okay, that was pretty good, let's just use that, next.'  There is also a credit for a film score, but I don't recall hearing much if any background music, something that certainly could have added atmosphere, especially in a supposed thriller.My other complaints with this movie also include its dialogue, especially the canned exchanges between Rodruigez and Eastwood.  Rodruigez plays an LAPD cop who obviously resents Eastwood's investigating a murder even though Eastwood's character is no longer a cop and doesn't even have a Private Eye license. The forced animosity between the two is so stock and stilted it's almost comical. There are other stock characters and situations that give this movie the look and feel of one of his dated Dirty Harry movies. At one point, Eastwood's character fires a shotgun into a car that he has seen more than once at a particular murder scene, and this without any questioning or provocation. For a few moments he is Dirty Harry again, and it doesn't work.And finally the plot holes. I would discuss these in more detail except that to do so would introduce spoilers. What I can say is that there are more than ample clues in the movie as to who the real killer is, enough so that I figured out the plot about one third the way through, and that's way too soon, especially considering that I don't usually figure this kind of thing out that quickly.This movie is worth a late night watch on HBO or maybe even a video rental, but that's about it. It's not a film I would buy.

The Picture cars are still alive and well today. One was kept by the director himself and another as some of you will remember was a prize for a competition to promote the movie.

I'm not a huge fan of Josh Hartnett, though I've seen him perform well in some films. It just didn't look all that particularly good, but with the library expanding their DVD limit from 3 at a time to 5, that leaves me a little more room to experiment. Hence, 40 Days and 40 Nights.It's not the worst pitch &#150; a man who has trouble getting over his ex takes a vow of celibacy for Lent while he tries to get his life back together &#150; but it's not the most inspired idea for a film either. What could have been an intelligent, sarcastic look at sex degenerates into a teenage sex comedy, complete with repeated masturbation jokes, naked or nearly-naked women, and an almost complete loss of focus through much of the film.Hartnett gives it a game try, but the script is just too juvenile. Most of Matt's (Hartnett) co-workers, including his roommate, are morons, obsessed with sex and boobs, and his brother is a priest, who really isn't much help to him throughout the picture. Of course right after he swears off women he meets the right one, Erica (Shannyn Sossaman), who finds out the wrong way about his vow. Naturally he has to balance his celibacy with his burgeoning desire for Erica, whom he actually really likes, and I saw an opportunity to make a point about making a connection on a plane other than physical, but apparently even that sentiment was too deep for this film, which largely consists of the same gag repeated, namely, everyone tries to get Matt to get off. Guys try to slip him viagra. Women come on to him with tricks borrowed from the lamest porn movies. Guys hand him Penthouse magazines. And so on. I suppose your average sixth grader would have found it really funny, but mostly, the film's just an embarrassment.One small note; the ever-wonderful Michael Maronna (Big Pete on The Adventures of Pete and Pete) has a recurring role as a bagel delivery man known simply as Bagel Guy. He has most of the better lines and as usual displays sharp comic timing. But not worth sitting through just to see his small part.

It isn't great because of only one of these things, but they all contribute to the quirkiness and coolness of the film. Not one moment of the film is wasted, everything contributes to it. The silences and pauses are just perfect, the dialogue is just long enough to make you think about how much time is being spent on a certain conversation, but not too long as to seem to try too hard, like so many other films have since Pulp Fiction. This movie is far from an action movie, and it is not a comedy, despite it being quite hilarious throughout. It is a twisted, unorthodox, and overall wonderfully directed and edited piece of filmaking that makes great use of its seemingly trivial parts as almost the main focus of the film, and uses these things to enhance the characters and the storyline. Each character gets his or her time to shine without it seeming like the film is making room for this, as Tarantino just tells each one's story in his amazing way, taking all of his perfectly orchestrated pieces, and putting them all together in the end...

Seeing it recently, it still has a cynical view of the future.  Some of those things have come true, such as 10 year old children stealing, committing violence, and handling automatic weapons.  That seemed far fetched in 1990 but not in a post Columbine world where children have easy access to these weapons and use them.  Taking an entire city private sounds like one of those things that current President George W. Bush might think of, since he wants to privatize everything else. As for the movie itself, the action scenes are very well done, especially the battle between Robocops.  Peter Weller and Nancy Allen do a good job in their returning roles.  However some plotlines, such as how much of Robocop is still Murphy are talked about and then dropped.  The movie also has an overemphasis on torture that could have been toned down.

Seeing it recently, it still has a cynical view of the future.  Some of those things have come true, such as 10 year old children stealing, committing violence, and handling automatic weapons.  That seemed far fetched in 1990 but not in a post Columbine world where children have easy access to these weapons and use them.  Taking an entire city private sounds like one of those things that current President George W. Bush might think of, since he wants to privatize everything else. As for the movie itself, the action scenes are very well done, especially the battle between Robocops.  Peter Weller and Nancy Allen do a good job in their returning roles.  However some plotlines, such as how much of Robocop is still Murphy are talked about and then dropped.  The movie also has an overemphasis on torture that could have been toned down.  I'm not a person who usually complains about violence in movies, but here the violence is excessive.  Overall a mixed bag that gets 5\/10  from me.

The sequel made 13 years later was majorly successful. Then in came this film.Most people thought that this movie was the worst Texas Chainsaw Massacre film, and I can see why they say that; non-Tobe-hooper, different leatherface, different family, not connected to the original films, not enough chainsaw. But, just put that all aside for now.When I saw this movie, I thought it was one of my favorite movies. i LOVED this movie SO much I just had to buy a copy. This movie was the first TCM movie I ever got to see, and I thought it was AWESOME, thanks to Ken Foree, Viggo Mortensen, and my personal favorite... Tom Everette.

Mihailoff was NO Gunnar Hensen, but he still came on strong in his own way. I love this movie, even though it was a LITTLE success to the chainsaw franchise, it at least didn't destroy the TCM franchise unlike The Kim Henkel made film TCM The Next Generation did. Hell, it was even put on the top bottom movies of IMDb. WHAT A BURN!One of the reasons I also love this movie so much is because of some of the soundtrack which has quite a bit of Thrash Metal such as Laaz Rockit - Leatherface, Sacred Reich - One-Nation, and my personal favorite, Wrath - When Worlds Collide. Also, this movie is the reason why I took the vintage direction into metal, and in particular, Thrash Metal. I think that they should have used more Wrath on the soundtrack using songs like Mutants, Ripped Into Pieces, Hell Is Full, and Painless. Basically, they could have even used their entire album Nothing To Fear Which is why I wrote a script about TCM with Wrath Nothing To Fear as the soundtrack. Anyway, I would like others to see it, because it is worth watching. Great heavy metal soundtrack, awesome chainsaw, Leatherface's mask looks awesome, nice job of Ken Foree.

Pitt is playing his cool self and of course the twist in the end is meant to be much more complex than what's explained. There are single frames of Pitt popping up early in the film which is a foreshadowing of him as a projectionist slicing a few frames of porn into family flicks and definitely a hint at that nothing here is what it seems. These single frames also clearly help establish that we are in a parallel universe (or a dream, or Norton-s mind....)Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) plays like a modern English version of something right out of a 1970s Nouvelle Vague. Perfect.In fact most of the acting is certainly inspired by 1970s European, namely French, movies. no-one really cares or wonders enough, no matter how extreme the situation they go through. on the other hand no-one goes for overly European\/artsy, this is still all very American,just far away from Hollywood mainstream. Most of the set pieces are amazing. We seem to recognize most of them from our nightmares and they will linger on in our minds long after viewing.The laws of physics don't quite apply here and all dialog is surreal in a way.

And now?  Now, human sacrifices aside, I think I'd like to live on this film's fictional Summer Isle.  What a groovy place.Oh, and I do like the movie these days.A few crotchety commentators have pointed out some plot holes, and I think their arguments need debunking.  The cultists were not necessarily counting on Woodward being a virgin; that was a bonus.  Even if he wasn't quite so pure, his status as (a) an adult and (b) a representative of the government would still have made him a good sacrifice, if not ideal.  And I get the feeling that, had Woodward not come through in the end, the cultists really would've burned that girl.But tish and pish to all such concerns, since horror movies are never really supposed to make sense anyway.  The really great thing about this film is its oppressive atmosphere and general freakyness.  I love the wonderful folk music, the passive-aggressive townsfolk, the eerie animal masks, the drawn out sacrifice segment; it's all so ballsy, when you consider that the average movie plays it so much safer by comparison.  And of course, the contrast between the island's idyllic appearance and the sinister goings-on there works really well.This is a cult classic that deserves its status.

It might have the most beautiful set and light design I've seen in this genre - ever. Director Dario Argento is kind of a Tim Burton of the horror genre, giving us a completely unique and visually stunning vision of what other directors would leave as gray shadows and dull props. I guess there's the idea of lighting films in a realistic manner. But in the horror genre, that seems a little silly since the story lines deal with mostly impossible situations and characters anyway. In some ways - and this is a compliment - the look of this film reminds of me of the original STAR TREK TV series, for all it's use of bright color and over-the-top sets. Argento takes it orders of magnitude higher, however, and gives us images that could be taken as stills, framed and displayed in art galleries.SUSPIRIA is not a perfect film by any means, but I believe many fans of this film and its director are won over by the look of it all. And I completely understand that. Where this movie fell short in my viewing was in problems with pacing and storyline. It's great that Argento gave us some nice establishing shots and wide shots of where all the mayhem takes place, but sometimes it seems to linger there too long, and return too often. This coupled with the sometimes confusing order of information we're given (I'd wished we'd gotten things a little earlier or later in places) made the whole feel less than it should have been. And there is a moment or two where the special effects get a bit cheesy by today's standards. I think these moments are magnified by the contrast of how good everything else looks, so it's unfortunate, but probably unavoidable for the day.At this point I also must bring up the issue of gore in the horror genre. There seem to be 2 camps on this subject those that want to see everything in great detail, and those that believe that less is more, and leaving things to the imagination can often be more powerful and effective (I sight JAWS on this issue - we only see one full-on shark attack, and that's at the end - all others are offscreen or have an obscured view, and it's one of the scariest movies ever made). I'm in the second group, so I must say I found certain gore aspects to be overdone, often to the point of trivializing the event. But I'm sure those who like gore in their horror will like SUSPIRIA's content even more. For those who can't handle it at all, however, this might not be your cup of tea.

If you love those pesky 80's movies, then this one has nor name on it!!!Fair.Cxx ","genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"1 July 2004","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  Ever read about the concerns that some media groups have aboutviolence in movies and bad language and how that effects ourchildren?  Well, I'm writing this review to remind us all that it's true. We bought this movie years ago, and on a snow day from schoolkids were out for a week here we let our oldest daughter watchboth RH 1 and RH 2 back to back for a couple of days in a row.  Wewarned our then second grader about how there is bad languageand martial arts moves in this movie that were never to besaid\/repeated in public.  She swore she would never do\/say suchthings.  And then she went back to school.That first day back, she completed a series of martial arts kicks onkids mostly boys on the playground.  And then she used the BWord on two boys and a girl during the school day that's ChrisTucker's favorite cuss word in this movie.  Needless to say, she was grounded.  And she also was put on adiet of G movies until she learned her lesson completely about ayear.  This movie was excellent.  But don't be fooled.  Young children areindeed highly impressionable and do not need to watch thesemovies until they are old enough to understand fiction\/reality. I gave this movie a 7 out of 10.  My husband and I find this wholeseries just wonderful.  Chan's and Tucker's chemistry just keepgetting better and better as the years go by.  However, I'drecommend this to adults or older teenagers only.
