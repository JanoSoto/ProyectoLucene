[{"date":"12 September 2015","score":"","review":" Texas home video store clerk Matthew McConaughey (as Ed Pekurny) attracts the attention of True TV producer Ellen DeGeneres (as Cynthia Topping). She wants to star Mr. McConaughey in a 24-hour reality show. At first, big executive Rob Reiner (as Whitaker) seems reluctant, but Ms. DeGeneres is a persuading advocate for Ed TV. The TV show is a huge hit, as you may have guessed. The cameras capture McConaughey when he wakes up reaching for himself in sweatpants, and throughout his days. Release forms are signed by McConaughey's friends and relatives. Most often seen are worked-out older brother Woody Harrelson (as Ray) and UPS truck driver girlfriend Jenna Elfman (as Shari)...Everyone loves Ed but me. Look at all the fans. All ages, classes, regions, races, creeds, colors and gender preferences are portrayed as avid Ed supporters. Granted, McConaughey is a good looking man, but what is his character's appeal? He and his morning chubby are a bore. His romantic comedy adventures are not fun or funny. We could see Howard Beale's appeal in Network (1976) and get The Truman Show (1998). Now, perhaps director Ron Howard and the writers are making a point about US television viewers. If so, the years have proved them accurate.Ed may intentionally be made a common man. That's fine, but it still lacks a satirical bite...If you're interested in movie, movie making, Ed TV has an added interest in that it is a movie about motion pictures (albeit television). The production values are very high, with outstanding cinematography by John Schwartzman. The lighting technicians are especially skillful. Many scenes feature incredibly artful lighting. On televisions in the movie, the visuals are less than lackluster...Long-time followers of Mr. Howard will see his old Happy Days pal Donny Most in a minor role. Among the others is the director's brother Clint Howard. For some reason, the camera zooms in on Clint's hair transplant. By the way, we're shown a close-up of McConaughey clipping his toenails, but have no idea how he maintains that perfectly maintained stubble. Veterans Sally Kirkland and Martin Landau are Ed's parents. They do a fine job, and Harrelson is more than convincing as the brother. In fact, Woody looks like Matt's brother. Semi-sexual attraction includes the brothers appearing half-dressed and an arousing woman in thong. Beating all is Elizabeth Hurley (as Jill), who radiates sex...So, maybe Ed TV was about watching him have sex, all along. If so, you won't learn or see much.***** Ed TV (1999-03-26) Ron Howard ~ Matthew McConaughey, Jenna Elfman, Woody Harrelson, Ellen DeGeneres ","genre":null},{"date":"12 September 2015","score":"","review":" Texas home video store clerk Matthew McConaughey (as Ed Pekurny) attracts the attention of True TV producer Ellen DeGeneres (as Cynthia Topping).
