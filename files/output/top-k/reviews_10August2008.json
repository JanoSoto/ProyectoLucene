The battle scenes are well directed, but Gibson seems to revel in making it as gory as possible. Gibson, while not doing a bad job as Wallace, looks like a straggly Kevin Costner from Robin Hood Prince of Thieves who's lived away from civilisation for a while. Mind you, he conveys the wild side of the Scottish rebel's character well, and gives a good performance. There are several historical inaccuracies in the film, such as the ban on playing bagpipes stated near the beginning (about 450 years early). The affair with the queen is ridiculous, but serves as a plot device. After all that, you're probably wondering why I gave this an eight. Despite all its faults, Braveheart is beautifully filmed, attractively scored and the acting of the majority of the cast is positive. I would not go out of my way to see this film, but if it's on television and you aren't busy, I would recommend you seeing this film.

Yeah, Ernst and Fritz are German names, that's true. We don't know the parents's names but Robinson and Francis do not sound swiss at all, they do sound like americanos or even British.As for the movie, I admit that at first I was doubtful about it, but it's a watchable family movie. It's an okay adventure\/family movie. I mean, of all the live-action Disney films, I wouldn't say this is my favorite or one of my favorites, but it remains faithful to the traditional ones in many ways, even if it isn't as good as the best.Many people say this movie looks very dated, but I disagree. Sure, looking at it we know immediately this is an old movie. What I'm trying to say is that, considering its age, it doesn't look that dated. It doesn't look as old as it is. For example, The Ugly Dachshund was made a few years after this and looks way more dated. Popeye is another perfect example of this it came out 20 years after this and looks much more dated than this.The story of this is a kind of story very familiar in numerous adventure films, taking place in a desert island after a ship sinking or getting stuck on rocks (in this case, it gets stuck on rocks). It's a humble yet sympathetic plot, with comedy and lots of adventure.One of the things that bug me in this movie is the pirates. Those pirates can be quite annoying. And yet, the final battle with them is one of the movie's most hilarious moments, especially when little Francis Robinson throws them coco-nut bombs.The cast features 3 familiar actors from Old Yeller Dorothy McGuire, Tommy Kirk and Kevin Corcoran. Like in Old Yeller, Dorothy McGuire plays the mom, while Tommy Kirk and Kevin Corcoran play brothers. It's amazing that they played brothers in 5 films. Extraordinary, isn't it? The main actors play well their roles. John Mills and Dorothy McGuire as the parents, James MacArthur as Fritz, Tommy Kirk as Ernst and Kevin Corcoran as Francis. Here both Tommy Kirk and Kevin Corcoran are as good as in Old Yeller. Tommy's voice, however, sounds a bit different here and he looks taller too (well, he was 3 years older, right?). Kevin Corcoran got a bit chubbier here, didn't he? (no complaints at all, just an observation)I've noticed that many people complain about the character Francis, they seem to consider him annoying and obnoxious. I don't think so I think he's a cute and smart kid. He also loves animals and he has some great ideas, such as the tiger's trap and the coco-nut bombs.One of the movie's best things is its exotic sceneries and landscapes. What we see is real, pure and beautiful nature trees, forests, green places, mountains, beaches, sea, lots of sun and some sunset moments, among other things. We also get to see some wild animals, such as a giant turtle, a tiger (magnificent animal), an elephant calf and others. Elephants are not really beautiful, but they are cute, magnificent and majestic creatures. I think exactly the same about hippos they're simply fantastic animals.Since this is a movie about Robinsons, maybe the song Mrs. Robinson (by Simon & Garfunkel) would be good for the movie's Mrs. Robinson - lol. Just kidding. It's a great song, but wouldn't fit well in this kind of movie. Besides, the song is from 1968 and the movie came out 8 years before.

If you were a teenager during 1973 you must see this movie. Ang Lee brings that era back in spades. The wardrobe is just amazing. 1973 was a really weird year anyway, people were depressed the sixties were over, nobody knew what would be next.. It was a really strange time. There was the first gas shortage in US history, and the price doubled. When you could find it. Terrific soundtrack, and a thought provoking look back at the US of that time. An all star cast, I won't repeat a lot of what's already been said, but the movie is like a virtual time machine.I think we were a better society then, a more tolerant one. Even Nixon seems benign compared to our current government.The serendipity of Tobey Maguire reading Marvel Comics is surreal now, with that whole Spiderman career of sorts which followed. The Party he thought he was going to be alone with Katie Holmes was evocative as well.. If you weren't partying, you weren't connecting. Human connection and family is the core of this movie. The recurring attempts at a real human connection was thematic. Joan Allen's quirky shoplifting and bicycle riding, her encounters with the long haired Reverend Philip Edwards was insightful. This is a movie with layer upon layer of pathos.I do think a special mention is reserved for Allison Janney. Great as the hostess, Dot Halford, The Halfords annual party; this time with the twist of being a key party. Her role, though small, was memorable. Especially the Zebra dress. Very 1973. The upper-middle class average woodsy exurban living kind of mirrored my own. It's almost spooky exactly how spot on everything was. I think Kevin Kline, Sigourney Weaver, Joan Allen, and Jamey Sheridan were horribly overlooked during the Academy awards decision making process.The most hilarious scene in an otherwise dark movie was Wendy's (Cristine Ricci, who the camera just loves by the way,) trombone recital at home. It consisted of playing two notes (badly), over and over. There were a couple of others, like when Sigourney Weaver's character Janey Carver parked her station wagon, heard a loud pop, and looked at her tire, as if it had blown out. Turns out her number two son, Sandy, (deftly handled by Adam Hann-Byrd) was playing with fireworks and generally creating mayhem.. The offer of the whip to play with was priceless. (The keys she later fishes out of the bowl were attached to a rather long leather woven tether, it works well the way she handles those keys in a way similar to the way she handled the whip.) Then when she goes inside to inquire of Mikey (One of Elijah Wood's best performances to date), if HE were aware of the fireworks outside. Mikey, sitting with Wendy while they both watched television, was oblivious. Sigourney Weaver, hearing THAT just shakes her head and rolls her eyes in a combination of disbelief and exhasperation and goes back upstairs. Sigourney Weaver was excellent and Oscar worthy in my opinion for her credibility in this movie. I knew this character type from then.Ang Lee's use of ice as a recurring theme, was well established, early and often.. Ice Trays, the old fashioned kind you had to actually crack open really set the tone for that. Even the turkey that Kevin Kline and Joan Allen wrestle with is frozen. The fact that the final 18 minutes or so of the movie is without dialogue isn't really noticed, at least not by me. Very moving anyway, that whole dénouement.I think I was one of the 4000 people that actually saw this movie in theatrical release. It's a movie best watched alone or with one other person. It was an early matinée and I had the entire theater nearly to myself. That was great too.

Most of the people who bash this movie are off base. What occupies the screen more than suffices. The characters are lacking, but not cardboard or boring. The dialogue is bland but never bad. The visuals are awesome. Nobody uses scale and lighting to create tension better than director Roland Emmerich. He is one of the great action directors of our time. The problem is what we never see. It is a colossal, titanic, mammoth, astronomical and gigantic omission.Many people assert that the script is dumbed down. It is not. Con Air is dumbed down. Charlie's Angels is dumbed down. Batman and Robin is dumbed down. The Avengers is dumbed down. The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is dumbed down. I have not seen Armageddon, but judging by what I have read, it is the epitome of dumbed down.The Godzilla script makes sense and moves with clarity. It does not jump right into the action. Godzilla does not make an appearance until 25 minutes into the movie and we do not see his face until the 45 mark. The plot is simple to follow, and the main ideas and numerous developments are repeated in conversation. They also hold up under scrutiny. Roger Ebert raises many questions, but is wrong on the details. He questions why Godzilla fits into a subway tunnel. He does not. He burrows under it. We even see him do so later on. Ebert sees many movies so mistakes do happen. Speaking of Ebert, the mayor of New York and his assistant are patterned after him and then-partner Gene Siskel. I happen to like Ebert, but he was a grouch towards Emmerich's first two blockbusters Stargate and Independence Day. Godzilla invests a lot of time into its humans. There are four separated from the rest in the credits Niko Tatopoulos (Matthew Broderick), the expert on Godzilla; Philippe (Jean Reno), a Frenchman with initially mysterious motives; Audrey Timmonds (a hot Maria Pitillo), a reporter with ties to Tatopoulos; and 'Animal' Palotti (Hank Azaria), a cameraman who wants to help. Broderick and Pitillo fail to bring enough life to their characters. Pitillo cries in once scene, but the angle and lighting of the shot prevent me from seeing if her tears are real. Reno and Azaria inhabit the most distinctive roles in both writing and acting. Kevin Dunn plays an unusually smart military leader who makes Andre Braugher (Rise of the Silver Surfer) look like a cadaver.The Omission Godzilla's signature weapon, note the word *signature,* is the atomic beam he emits from his mouth. The beam is intensely hot and causes explosions upon impact. It is not fire; Godzilla is not a dragon. King Kong's size engenders fear, but Godzilla stands six times as tall. Nevertheless, *his beam* sets him apart from all other monsters. I watched Son of Godzilla as a child, and was awed by his neon blue ray. I was too young to see this Godzilla in theaters, but when I remembered and rented it, I eagerly awaited the atomic breath.*It never came!* Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich (writers, producer, director) try to fool the audience that the movie is over. I am sure many people fell for it, but I knew there was more to come. It couldn't be over, I thought, I have not yet seen the ray! I felt disbelief when I realized it was not going to come. Devlin and Emmerich stripped Godzilla of his most popular and distinctive quality, and cheated the audience of what most of them desired.The atomic breath had been used in 22 movies by that time. I love Devlin and Emmerich. Stargate is solid sci-fi entertainment. It spawned two television series with a combined 15 seasons and counting. Independence Day is the most stunning movie ever made. Twenty-two movies and cultural legend status is a lot of history. This is not their original material. Nobody, not them, not even Alfred Hitchcock, has the right to alter Godzilla. Godzilla could easily be a nine, but scores a six of ten instead.

Ebert sees many movies so mistakes do happen. Speaking of Ebert, the mayor of New York and his assistant are patterned after him and then-partner Gene Siskel. I happen to like Ebert, but he was a grouch towards Emmerich's first two blockbusters Stargate and Independence Day. Godzilla invests a lot of time into its humans. There are four separated from the rest in the credits Niko Tatopoulos (Matthew Broderick), the expert on Godzilla; Philippe (Jean Reno), a Frenchman with initially mysterious motives; Audrey Timmonds (a hot Maria Pitillo), a reporter with ties to Tatopoulos; and 'Animal' Palotti (Hank Azaria), a cameraman who wants to help. Broderick and Pitillo fail to bring enough life to their characters. Pitillo cries in once scene, but the angle and lighting of the shot prevent me from seeing if her tears are real. Reno and Azaria inhabit the most distinctive roles in both writing and acting. Kevin Dunn plays an unusually smart military leader who makes Andre Braugher (Rise of the Silver Surfer) look like a cadaver.The Omission Godzilla's signature weapon, note the word *signature,* is the atomic beam he emits from his mouth. The beam is intensely hot and causes explosions upon impact. It is not fire; Godzilla is not a dragon. King Kong's size engenders fear, but Godzilla stands six times as tall. Nevertheless, *his beam* sets him apart from all other monsters. I watched Son of Godzilla as a child, and was awed by his neon blue ray. I was too young to see this Godzilla in theaters, but when I remembered and rented it, I eagerly awaited the atomic breath.*It never came!* Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich (writers, producer, director) try to fool the audience that the movie is over. I am sure many people fell for it, but I knew there was more to come. It couldn't be over, I thought, I have not yet seen the ray! I felt disbelief when I realized it was not going to come. Devlin and Emmerich stripped Godzilla of his most popular and distinctive quality, and cheated the audience of what most of them desired.The atomic breath had been used in 22 movies by that time. I love Devlin and Emmerich. Stargate is solid sci-fi entertainment. It spawned two television series with a combined 15 seasons and counting. Independence Day is the most stunning movie ever made. Twenty-two movies and cultural legend status is a lot of history. This is not their original material. Nobody, not them, not even Alfred Hitchcock, has the right to alter Godzilla. Godzilla could easily be a nine, but scores a six of ten instead.

Most of the people who bash this movie are off base. What occupies the screen more than suffices. The characters are lacking, but not cardboard or boring. The dialogue is bland but never bad. The visuals are awesome. Nobody uses scale and lighting to create tension better than director Roland Emmerich. He is one of the great action directors of our time. The problem is what we never see. It is a colossal, titanic, mammoth, astronomical and gigantic omission.Many people assert that the script is dumbed down. It is not. Con Air is dumbed down. Charlie's Angels is dumbed down. Batman and Robin is dumbed down. The Avengers is dumbed down. The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is dumbed down. I have not seen Armageddon, but judging by what I have read, it is the epitome of dumbed down.The Godzilla script makes sense and moves with clarity. It does not jump right into the action. Godzilla does not make an appearance until 25 minutes into the movie and we do not see his face until the 45 mark. The plot is simple to follow, and the main ideas and numerous developments are repeated in conversation. They also hold up under scrutiny.
