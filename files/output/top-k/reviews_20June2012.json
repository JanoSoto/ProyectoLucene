They said that it was the funniest movie that they had ever seen, and so I suggested that I must pick up this movie on DVD and watch it. So, I sat down, watched it and I agree that this is probably one of the, if not, the best comedy ever made.STORY Monty Python and the Holy Grail follows Arthur, King of the Britons (Graham Chapman) and his servant Patsy (Terry Gilliam); who they're looking for some knights to join them at Camelot. When they meet, King Arthur gets a message from God that he and his fellow knights must go on a quest to find the Holy Grail. When they do that, they come across very ridiculous, but rather amusing encounters.MY THOUGHTS The humor in Monty Python and the Holy Grail is so silly and clever that it blows every American comedy that has been made in the last couple of years out of the water. British comedy literally isn't painfully dumb than American comedy, although ridiculous, the humor in British comedy can make you laugh. That's what I liked a lot in Monty Python and the Holy Grail; is the humor.Some of the animations are beautifully drawn and it gives a way to set up the subplot; just excellent. The way they used coconut halves and banging them together to make it sound like a horse trotting is so amusingly clever. The encounters were so funny and genuinely amusing, especially the encounter with The Black Knight, which I think is one of the silliest scenes in the history of comedy ('Tis but a scratch. Just a flesh wound.). And the part where King Arthur and his knights come across a French soldier who is taunting, another very hilarious scene (I fart in your general direction. Your mother was a hamster, and your father smelt of elderberries.). There is also more, which I won't give away because I don't want to spoil the whole movie for everybody who hasn't seen this movie.The main characters and a few of the supporting characters like Tim the Enchanter and Prince Herbert are very likable, hilarious, and well-developed. Although the rest have short appearances, they were funny as well. There were a lot of silly moments in Monty Python and the Holy Grail that I suggest that people should definitely check out.THE ACTING The acting in this is excellent and very funny. Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, among the other guys from Monty Python, they do excellent playing multiple roles.IN CONCLUSION Monty Python and the Holy Grail is &#x96; without a doubt &#x96; the best comedy ever made. I can't recommend this movie enough.

Approaching this gangster saga, you will not find Clint Eastwood in a poncho, and you have to deal with it. Once you do, you have four very good hours in front of you.The film follows Noodles (Robert De Niro) in three parallel acts. First as a child, where he and his gang of hoodlums starts out with harmless thefts against drunkards, before things escalate into a violent and life-changing confrontation with the older gangster rival Bugsy (James Russo), all the while chasing the girls of New York. Then as an adult in his life of organized crime and associations with the labor union during the prohibition era, where Noodles' best friend Max's descent into madness plays a key part. And finally as an old man returning to his old neighbourhood to tie up loose ends from his life. The three parts fit nicely together, and the editing between them works fine.All in all, the film has a fine ensemble. De Niro more or less plays the same type of guy that he does in all gangster films I have seen him in, meaning that he is solid and knows his part as the back of his hand. Joe Pesci shows up as he does in all gangster films I have seen, although he is more understated during his brief appearance here. Tuesday Weld looks uncannily alike some Hitchcock character, perhaps one played by Eva Marie Saint, in her unthankful role as a gangster wife. The real star, however, might be James Woods in his mentally unstable portrayal of Max, whose madness breaks out whenever the condition is implied in conversation.In four hours, Leone has time to cover a lot of ground, and there are several highlights. My favourite scene is the one where Noodles finally goes on a date with the love of his life Deborah (Elizabeth McGovern). It starts off romantically, but evolves into sadness as she says that he is the only person she has ever cared for, but then asks, in a moment of unusual clarity for women in gangster films, you'd lock me up and throw away the key, wouldn't you?, to which Noodles replies that he probably would. This sums up almost every gangster relationship ever depicted on film. The episode, as many others, then concludes in a gruesome manner.What might distinguish Once Upon a Time in America from other films of its ilk is how nostalgic and sentimental it feels, which I don't mean in a negative sense (except at its low point when it plays some washed-out version of Yesterday); the childhood act takes you back to a time when the streets of New York were brimming with life (due to terrific compositions) in another sense than today, whereas the (chronologically) last segment finds a worn out Noodles reminiscing about those days and what has been. The final scene, in which he sees some young people going by fast in their fancy cars, feels like the moment where his memories of youth escape him. Even the part that takes place in between, where the gang is doing well financially, is less than usual about being a high roller and more about regretting what you've done and dealing with its aftermath, as represented by a phone that won't stop ringing. The most conspicuous aspect of the film is perhaps Ennio Morricone's bittersweet, nostalgic score that runs through virtually every scene. It borders on sentimentality, but it fits a movie about a man looking back on his life perfectly.

It's just a biopic that happens to take place during WW II and that involves an allied army general. But the true focus of the movie is really on its main character and his very strong and unique personality. Having said that, it of course still has the look and feeling of a WW II movie, complete with also plenty of epic battles.It's fascinating to see the war through the eyes of a person who absolutely and completely lives and breaths for it. Patton was simply born to lead battles and make strategic choices. His personality and behavior brings him in trouble, especially with does above him and make him unpopular with some of his men but it seems that everybody still everybody seems happy about it that Patton is on their side. He was unmissable and yet impossible at the same time but he definitely helped to change the outcome of the war.The character of course gets mostly brought to live by George C. Scott's Oscar winning performance. He really becomes the character and helps to make him a very powerful and unforgettable one. And even while he of course is being a totally despicable character, he always remains a very likable one, that you besides learn to understand and grow lots of respect for.

Schaffner truly did a fine directing job with this!An absolute must-see for its main character, the performance by Scott, the wonderful musical score by Jerry Goldsmith and just simply because this is one fine movie to watch!10\/10http\/\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\/ ","genre":"Biography, Drama, War"},{"date":"20 June 2012","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" As much as I have always admired Hitchcock's work, I just couldn't bare the monotony and flatness that surround The Paradine Case. Unfortunately, this film is probably one of the most boring and least interesting of all of the great director's works. The storyline is very slow and simple, and there aren't any spectacular suspenseful moments that he accustomed us to so frequently. Sadly, in times of so many fast-paced and impressive courtroom thrillers and dramas (i.e. Witness for the Prosecution, Anatomy of a Murder, Judgment at Nuremberg) this movie really deserved the bad reputation that it gained in the first few years after its original release.If it weren't for the well-known director and notable movie stars, the movie would probably end up as some long-forgotten B-grade flick that no one would really want to watch.It's a story of forbidden romance, which began between a woman, accused of killing her blind husband, and her prominent defender. This chief motive intertwines with all the events that occur inside the courtroom.The movie started a mindset connected with the notions of feminism. It presents how a woman is able to wrap a man around her finger and make him do everything that she says. She is the strong figure that gives orders, and manipulates all those men, who fall in love with her at first sight.Still, I must say that there are some positive aspects that may be taken from the movie. Definitely, the viewer is able to admire the very decent scenery, set, and costumes shown in the picture.The movie presents a fine insight into the London middle class life. It also depicts, in an inquisitive manner, how the English court operated on a daily basis in those times, and proved once again that all the proceedings, consisting of various twists and revelations, might be thrilling, and can sometimes end up in a very surprising fashion. The acting is on a very high level. Gregory Peck is great as the barrister Anthony Keane, who falls blindly in love with a woman he is supposed to defend with cold blood and full consciousness of the mind, not through heart and emotions. Charles Laughton gives a convincing performance, as the strict, rigorous, emphatic and ironic judge. He is in total contradiction with Peck's character, one might notice. Alida Valli is mesmerizing As Lady Paradine, with all her grace and beauty, which makes it easy to see why every man lusts her and falls under her spell. Ann Todd as the brave and lovable Gay Keane, a wife, who even under the difficult circumstances doesn't give up and lets go of the jealousy.All in all, The Paradine Case looks more like a soap opera designed for TV, not a substantial film directed by one of the greatest director's in history. However, as you watch it, don't concentrate too much on the story, and simply enjoy the precise and entertaining courtroom scenes and the pleasurable subtleness of London's atmosphere.

Cubby Broccoli wanted Pierce Brosnan, but the actor was committed to the T.V. series 'Remington Steele'. The final choice surprised many ( including me ) - noted Shakespearian actor Timothy Dalton. The phrase 'tall, dark, and handsome' could have been created specially for him. He had been offered the part back in 1968, but turned it down as he considered himself too young ( he was right ). The change in actor also signalled in a major shift in tone for the films, away from what had been established in the Moore era and back towards the harder style of the early Connerys. Dalton was much closer to the Fleming character than his predecessors. There were other changes too - with A.I.D.S. very much in the news, Bond's womanising was cut down. 'The Living Daylights' is based on Fleming's 1962 short story of that name. After a stunning opening in Gibraltar where a training mission for the 00's is brutally interrupted by actual death, the film proper begins with Bond supervising the defection of top K.G.B. mastermind 'General Koskov' ( Jeroen Krabbe ), a job which involves the shooting of a sniper who he discovers is a beautiful cellist named 'Kara Milovy' ( Maryam d'Abo ). The first twenty minutes are brilliant, and one suspects Fleming himself would have approved of the results. Back in England, Koskov tells M ( Robert Brown ) that the K.G.B. are planning an operation - called 'Smiert Spionam' - involving the deaths of American and British agents, and that 'General Pushkin' ( John Rhys Davies ) is behind it. The K.G.B. snatches Koskov back with the aid of voice-changing assassin 'Necros' ( Andreas Wisniewski ). Koskov has misappropriated party funds to buy opium from rebels in Afganistan ( this was made during the Russian occupation ). He is in cahoots with an American arms dealer - 'Brad Whitaker' ( Joe Don Baker ) - who is obsessed by military history.This is not your usual Bond story, as you may have gathered. Richard Maibaum and Michael G.Wilson's script is well written, but suffers from being over-complicated. It also lacks a central villain - Koskov is too amusing to be a threat to Bond, and Whitaker ( who could have been one of the all-time great 007 villains ) is woefully underused. Some great action scenes though; we get a new version of the famous Aston Martin which cuts a police car in half with a laser as it gives chase, and fires rockets at roadblocks. The destruction of the bridge is stunning, as is the fight between Bond and Necros aboard the plane. John Terry is the latest in a long line of 'Felix Leiter's' ( the first time the character had been seen since 'Live & Let Die' ( 1973 ). Thomas Wheatley is very good as Bond's contact 'Saunders'. John Barry provides the music for the last time ( and has a cameo ). The theme song by a-Ha tends to divide people; I rather like it. The Pretenders provided two additional tracks - 'Where Has Everybody Gone?' and 'If There Was A Man'.Though 'Daylights' performed well in Britain, in the States it was greeted with indifference. Fleming fans rejoiced at the arrival of Dalton's Bond, but the public found it hard to adjust after twelve years of Roger Moore. Dalton only did one more film in the role - 'Licence To Kill' ( 1989 ). Interviewed on breakfast television in 2006 - not long Daniel Craig's 'Casino Royale' had opened - the presenter said its success vindicated Dalton's performance. It is hard to disagree.

In my opinion Alien is a perfect film, while Aliens despite being very entertaining is not nearly as scary and has its flaws. This sequel was directed by James Cameron and his trademarks are all over this film. Ridley Scott had managed to direct a small psychological science fiction horror flick, while Cameron made a much larger film, with many aliens, more characters, and a lot more action. This is more of a blockbuster movie than anything else. I've always been a fan of much quieter films that focus on psychological scares than big budget action movies so that may be one of the reasons why I liked Alien much more than Aliens. There is no doubt about Cameron's ability to direct these big budget movies and he always delivers spectacular visual effects, but story wise his films are sometimes lacking in quality. The characters are many times one dimensional and that is exactly the case in Aliens. The only character I really liked in this film and that has depth is Sigourney Weaver's Ripley. Unlike in Alien where the main character seemed to be the alien despite not showing up much on screen; in Aliens we have plenty of screen time for the aliens, but I never felt like they were a main character. It's as if so much overexposure to them made me care less about the aliens and more about Ripley. So in conclusion Alien was the creature's movie, while Aliens is Weaver's film. She has a very strong role and her presence is what has made this film so successful. She carries the film and in a way makes us forget about the rest of the one dimensional characters. The story continues right where the original left off with Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) in the Nostromo shuttle in hypersleep along with her cat. She is awaken by a salvage team that has found her vessel drifting through space. Burke (Paul Reiser), who works for the same company that the original crew members worked for, informs Ripley that she has been asleep for 57 years. The company briefs Ripley as to what happened with the ship and the rest of the members, and don't believe her story. They say that if her story were true then the colony of over 60 families that has been living on the planet where she claims to have seen the derailed ship would have encountered the aliens by now. The colony has been there for over twenty years without experiencing difficulties, and Ripley is discharged as a space pilot. Some time later, when the company loses contact with the colony, Burke asks Ripley to come along with them as a consultant. The company sends a military team to find out what has happened to the colonists and Ripley is offered to come along with them reinstating her if she does so. This is just an excuse for Cameron to get the crew in the same planet as the aliens and have much more action. Ripley decides to travel with the team which consists of Lt. Gorman (William Hope), the android Bishop (Lance Henriksen), Cpl. Hicks (Michael Biehn), Pvt. Vasquez (Jenette Goldstein), Pvt. Hudson (Bill Paxton), Cpl. Ferro (Colette Hiller), among many other soldiers who are heavily armed and qualified. Once they reach the planet they find no sign of any colonists, except for a ten year old girl named Newt (Carrie Henn) who has managed to survive and tells them that monsters have killed the rest, and that they will come for them as well.This film marked a breakthrough in action films, but isn't really as scary as the original movie. The suspense and psychological horror is replaced with action packed shootouts and explosions. There are many more characters and a lot more aliens so there are a lot of things happening. This is what makes Aliens more entertaining for some people. Cameron had recently come from directing The Terminator so he was already making a name for himself and was able to work with a good budget. He is among the best when it comes to visuals and special effects and many of the visuals in this movie still look great today. Aliens won two Oscars for this reason. I'm not a huge fan of Cameron's work, although I have to admit Terminator 2 is one of the best action movies ever and definitely my favorite James Cameron film.

Unlike in Alien where the main character seemed to be the alien despite not showing up much on screen; in Aliens we have plenty of screen time for the aliens, but I never felt like they were a main character. It's as if so much overexposure to them made me care less about the aliens and more about Ripley. So in conclusion Alien was the creature's movie, while Aliens is Weaver's film. She has a very strong role and her presence is what has made this film so successful. She carries the film and in a way makes us forget about the rest of the one dimensional characters. The story continues right where the original left off with Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) in the Nostromo shuttle in hypersleep along with her cat. She is awaken by a salvage team that has found her vessel drifting through space. Burke (Paul Reiser), who works for the same company that the original crew members worked for, informs Ripley that she has been asleep for 57 years. The company briefs Ripley as to what happened with the ship and the rest of the members, and don't believe her story. They say that if her story were true then the colony of over 60 families that has been living on the planet where she claims to have seen the derailed ship would have encountered the aliens by now. The colony has been there for over twenty years without experiencing difficulties, and Ripley is discharged as a space pilot. Some time later, when the company loses contact with the colony, Burke asks Ripley to come along with them as a consultant. The company sends a military team to find out what has happened to the colonists and Ripley is offered to come along with them reinstating her if she does so. This is just an excuse for Cameron to get the crew in the same planet as the aliens and have much more action. Ripley decides to travel with the team which consists of Lt. Gorman (William Hope), the android Bishop (Lance Henriksen), Cpl. Hicks (Michael Biehn), Pvt. Vasquez (Jenette Goldstein), Pvt. Hudson (Bill Paxton), Cpl. Ferro (Colette Hiller), among many other soldiers who are heavily armed and qualified. Once they reach the planet they find no sign of any colonists, except for a ten year old girl named Newt (Carrie Henn) who has managed to survive and tells them that monsters have killed the rest, and that they will come for them as well.This film marked a breakthrough in action films, but isn't really as scary as the original movie. The suspense and psychological horror is replaced with action packed shootouts and explosions. There are many more characters and a lot more aliens so there are a lot of things happening. This is what makes Aliens more entertaining for some people. Cameron had recently come from directing The Terminator so he was already making a name for himself and was able to work with a good budget. He is among the best when it comes to visuals and special effects and many of the visuals in this movie still look great today. Aliens won two Oscars for this reason. I'm not a huge fan of Cameron's work, although I have to admit Terminator 2 is one of the best action movies ever and definitely my favorite James Cameron film. The screenplay was also written by Cameron along with the help of screenwriters David Giler and Walter Hill, and I had small issues with it, although the spectacular action sequences saved it. This is Sigourney Weaver's film and she truly broke out as an A-list actress with this movie. She shines as a true female action hero who's strong and emotional at the same time. Aliens is a good film, just not as perfect as Alien.http\/\/estebueno10.blogspot.com ","genre":"Action, Horror, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"20 June 2012","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" This film is strangely polarizing. It seems that most people either loved it or loathed it, and I don't consider myself in either group. I saw this movie for the first time years ago and didn't remember most of the details, so I decided it was time to watch it again and see what all the fuss is about. The version I saw was the director's cut, so I can't speak for the original.First off, I'd like to praise the acting. Most of the actors in this film were spot on, particularly Mary McDonnell as Donnie's mother, Rose. The only performance for me that didn't quite hit the mark was Jake Gyllenhaal's, but I think that's just a matter of personal preference, not a flaw in his acting. Drew Barrymore was excellent as the English teacher and I've always been a fan of Maggie Gyllenhaal's.One thing that really stood out for me in this film is how well the relationships between the characters were written. I found them well-developed, genuine and very enjoyable to watch, particularly those of the Darko family. Obviously the sibling relationship portrayed by the Gyllenhaals was spot on, but I also very much enjoyed the interactions between not only Donnie and his parents, but between the parents themselves.The negatives in this film come largely from the supporting characters and from some of the writing. I felt that most of the characters in Donnie's school were very two-dimensional and the dialogue between the young characters felt like it was written by someone who couldn't quite remember how they spoke in their teen years and gave it their best approximation. The banter between the teenage boys was stiff and not quite believable (and there was one line in particular directed at a young female character that I found offensive and unnecessary).I did enjoy the way everything plays out and comes together in the end. Though any story that deals in time travel is bound to have plot holes, I felt the plot was fairly well-executed and didn't leave any glaring inconsistencies.All in all, I found Donnie Darko to be quite watchable and reasonably intelligent, but with room for growth in the filmmaking. I wouldn't go so far as to call it brilliant or a masterpiece as so many others have, but it's a film that makes you think, and those can be hard to come by these days.

This movie, Breakdown (1997) and The Mean Season (1985) just to name a few. Personally, The Mean Season (1985) was his best because it was well rounded in every aspect of the story. This movie too, has a lot of tense moments, if not unpleasant but I can't help but feel that there were parts that could have been improved.The film itself actually displayed a comparison between its plot line and the one of The Cable Guy (1996). But there are key moments that make this thriller better than Jim Carrey's dark comedy. After having their house broken into, Michael Carr (Kurt Russell) and his wife (Madeleine Stowe) decide to have a security system put into their home. Fortunately, they have Peter Davis (Ray Liotta), a local cop who's generous enough to have it done for them with no charge. Or so they think.Turns out, it'll charge them more than they'll be able to handle. The personality of Mr. Davis is almost identical to the character of The Cable Guy. They're both lonely individuals who just want attention, but go about it in the creepiest and most dangerous ways possible. Davis has some serious mental problems that need to be addressed. Of course, this never is taken care of otherwise, this thriller movie would not be as tense as it's claimed to be. Soon things start heading downhill when Davis tries getting close to Mrs. Carr. Carr's credit cards start maxing out, he gets a fine for something he never did, and then ends up being jailed for a crime he was set up on. Sound familiar?The differences in this comparison are that Carrey is just an obnoxious maniac who just likes screwing up everyone's day. Liotta is a deadly killer, trained in the art of killing. The other contrast is that either situation could happen in real life, but, it's more likely that a case like this occurs involving a violent killer, and not some loony cable installer. So in a sense, the plot hits closer to home because it involves the home directly. A place where everyone lives in the real world.The acting is good too. Russell is believable as usual as is Stowe. Liotta looks like he prepared for his role in this film. His eyes reveal on screen very quickly that his character practically has no soul or conscious. He's that serious. But I am a bit puzzled on a specific detail. Davis had a partner, Roy Cole (Roger E. Mosely), which specifically stated by him for being with him for 7 years. What made Davis crack now? Was he that good at hiding his sick nature for all those years? Or was Cole just extremely oblivious? My other complaint personally is that I really enjoyed the theme composer James Horner hadfor the film, but there wasn't enough in beginning of the first coupleacts. It wasn't until about halfway through I actually heard creepy tunes being played. And Horner is a guy I like too. After producing other soundtracks with such iconic tones like Glory (1989) and The Rocketeer (1991), I thought I would also find it in this film too. Well my ears didn't totally get what they wanted to hear. Come on Horner!The main plot is a Xerox copy to that of The Cable Guy (1996), except Liotta's character for being so unforgiving and creating very tense scenes.

It can be a great motivator, a powerful experience, and an unforgettable feeling. It can also be a field of some very interesting research. At least, that's what Mark Lewis thinks in Peeping Tom. Mark is a shy and reclusive man on the outside, but inside he is deeply disturbed as he goes around with his camera, murdering women with it, filming their gruesome deaths the whole time. Peeping Tom is a disturbingly brilliant film that is far ahead of its time as it combines voyeurism, eroticism, and horror to paint the portrait of a hauntingly fascinating protagonist in the context of a dense and complex character study.Peeping Tom is a film that is highly successful in being multiple things. In part it is a fascinating experimental film that does unique things with its characters, setting, and musical score to be a film unlike something we've seen before. I mention the haunting score because it is only comprised of different piano songs, each adding a bizarre uniqueness to the mood of the film. Peeping Tom also succeeds in being a thrilling suspense film. The intensity of the film and the tension that is built up in different scenes is stupendous and it is the kind of atmosphere that draws you in so deep within the film.Lastly, Peeping Tom is part character study, an element that stands out most between the other two concepts of the film. The main focus of this film is our main character, Mark, and his disturbing condition. It's a challenging film in that his true motivations and true feelings are never fully explained, and we can only piece them together as the film progresses. But his character is truly fascinating and more complex than something we would normally see from the 60's.However, Peeping Tom still has those elements of influence from the 60's culture in the way the characters speak, interact, and what is actually shown on camera. If you're expecting a gruesome film you will be disappointed as Peeping Tom does things very different than what we would expect. If it were made today it would obviously be a vastly different film, but for what it accomplishes as a movie made in 1960, it is incredibly good.

Yes this is a confusing paradox but if you're familiar with Malick's work you'll know what I mean. You can read the synopsis of a Malick film and get an idea what the film will be about, but you will still have no clue as to how it is going to be presented. This is something that gets truer and truer with each film Malick makes. Days of Heaven is his second film and, while it seems like there isn't much going on, in reality a lot is going on... I think.Days of Heaven stars Richard Gere as a steel mill worker in Chicago in the 1900's who kills a man, so he, his girlfriend, and his sister flee the city and move to a farm where they work in the wheat fields. Gere has his girlfriend marry the farmer, whose nameless throughout the film and is only credited as The Farmer, in order to reap the benefits like living in the farmer's house. Now, that may seem fairly simplistic, but Malick turns this basic plot into a silver screen spectacle that you can't quite wrap your head around on the first viewing.The biggest thing to commend Malick on in this film is just the way it looks and the way it comes together visually. It is a beautiful period piece with a tantalizing setting shot in Malick's own illustrious fashion. There's plenty of subtly crafty camera-work in this film, and it makes it quite the visual treat. Yet, the visual quality is almost too subtle. It is the kind of film that you know you should appreciate, but it is difficult at times because the beauty is so minuscule and so meticulously perceived that the montages of the farms and the collection of long shots that seem almost as if they are just to fill time get a little tedious.The film's plot is the same way. In Days of Heaven Malick again shows his interest in focusing his story on a protagonist that we cannot sympathize with as he really should be the villain. Gere's character is conniving and sly, yet we are supposed to be on his side. The antagonist is the farmer, who is victimized in a film where he does nothing wrong. He is the unfortunate target of Gere's schemes, and this imbalance of good and evil adds a very subtle level of complexity to the film. As the narrator, Gere's character's little sister, puts it; we all have a little angel and a devil inside of us. This complex nature of the story and characters is very quiet and is hardly even the main focus of the film. It is, again, a clever aspect of the film that is almost too subtle.When it comes to a film like this it is hard to say it isn't great just because it's genius is too subtle. In my opinion more could have been done with this film, but Malick has his own unique way of filmmaking and I'm sure Days of Heaven turned out exactly how he wanted it to.

They surprise, frustrate, intrigue, irritate, and mystify me. None has been a mood enhancer. Dancer in the Dark is a case in point. I have seen several movies that make a case against the death penalty, but this one has been the most intense. The prolonged final scenes are painful to watch. The most depressing scene shows the audience slowly leaving after the execution.Bjork plays Selma, a rather simpleminded young woman who is going blind and has a son who has inherited the condition. Through a sequence of unfortunate events, often implausible and exaggerated, Selma winds up on death row in Washington State in the United States. The movie could be set in almost any western country, except it had to be set in a place where the death penalty was legal, so the state of Washington in the United States was an appropriate choice. The fact that death by hanging was the preferred method of execution in Washington State at the time this movie was set (1964) I am sure excited von Trier's imagination in how he could make the execution as horrific as possible. I suspect that the decision to make Selma blind was to be able to accentuate the barbarity of the execution scene.I came into this movie pretty much blind, so to speak, and was taken totally by surprise when the drama in Selma's factory was interrupted by a song and dance number. At odd moments the movie takes off into song and dance fantasy land; there are several musical numbers scattered throughout the movie. The scene that has Selma bursting into song on her way to the gallows has to be the most bizarre. The musical numbers are filmed in vibrant colors that contrast with the drab colors in the rest of the movie. The singing and dancing scenes are inventively choreographed.I knew almost nothing about Bjork before seeing this movie, except that she is a singer. I was impressed by her performance, especially since this was her first. She was required to play some intense scenes that must have been emotionally draining for her--at least they were for me.The use of hand-held cameras that von Trier so favors is ever-present, combined with rapid pans and zooming in and out. I understand the goals of these techniques--dynamism, more natural performances, attention focusing--but the effect on me is to make me dizzy. I tend to want to discount von Trier, but I cannot deny his artistry. For example, the overture to Dancer in the Dark that has a slowly changing image accompanied by music, captured my imagination. Not sure that the overture has much to do with the rest of the movie, except maybe establish a mood.

I tend to want to discount von Trier, but I cannot deny his artistry. For example, the overture to Dancer in the Dark that has a slowly changing image accompanied by music, captured my imagination. Not sure that the overture has much to do with the rest of the movie, except maybe establish a mood.
