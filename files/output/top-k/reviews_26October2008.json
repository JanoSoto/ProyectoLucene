Heroic when he comes back and she flies into his arms. Suspencefull when they have to fight yet another problem. So very predictable.Then there's the directing and editing. I cant believe anyone thinks highly of Michael Bay. The editing was so fast that at times you simply had no clue what was happening and why. The depiction of a flattened Paris uninspired and not very believable. The carnage in New York too much and grossly overdone not to mention way too long. The movie lacks pace in some parts and has too much in others. This is an important aspect for a director and if he cant understand this the movie is doomed, which it is.Then there's the acting. The dialogs between Affleck and Willis where awful. The action unconvincing. Affleck does his best to look bored and has a flat display. Willis was not much better. Liv Tyler was not bad but played the - obligatory in these kind of movies - love interest of Affleck with the only purpose in her life twiddling the engagement ring between her fingers. Owen Wilson was like a child so bad. The only actor who got to his usual standards was Buscemi but granted, the dialogs where simply terrible for everybody.I've seen some bad movies in my life, notably the Seagal or Van Damme movies, but this one really tops everything I've ever came across. After about 10 minutes of watching i predicted the end would be Tyler jumping in Afflecks arms under cheers from onlookers with a hugely heroic music back ground. And duly that happened.

It can be said that doing a sequel to Halloween was a bad idea in the first place, and we should feel lucky that the previous entries, even at their lowest, were still watchable. But even still, Halloween The Curse Of Michael Myers -- even today -- is so bad, it's shocking. Poor movie-making at it's worst, indeed. There is so much blame to go around. But where to begin? Whose shoulders does this blame rest on? Was it director Joe Chapelle's style-over-substance directing? Well, at the very least, the sixth installment is fresh on the visual front. And as far the visual effects go, you get to see Michael kill in some pretty gruesome ways, even if it doesn't quite fit in with the overall tone of the series.So, could Daniel Ferrands' troubled script be the culprit? Well, to be fair, he did the best he could. By the time you reach the sixth entry in any series, you're running out of places to go. Finding a rhyme to Michael's reason isn't a bad concept so much as it's an uninteresting one, especially the way it's handled here. And it really doesn't help that the movie was hacked to pieces and sewn back together so many times that the story got completely lost towards the end.Perhaps Dimension\/Miramax could have botched the whole thing. Afterall, this was the first studio film in the Halloween series and we all know what happens when too many cooks get in the kitchen. Heck, look at the unbelievable lows they dragged Hellraiser to? I guess everyone is to blame, because aside from the actors and the visual effects guys, it seems nobody put in the effort to deliver a decent flick.The bottom line, though, is that no matter how you cut it, slice it, dice it or electrocute it until it's head explodes, Halloween The Curse Of Michael Myers was never a good film. Marking an all-time low for the series that nearly killed off any credibility for Michael Myers, Curse is just that cursed. The thorn angle was never interesting, nor was it probably expanded upon. The needless gore is so out of place and replaces the tension that is the trademark of the Halloween name. Towards the end, the movie stops making sense, stops trying to push a plot and simply tries to find a way to kill the characters and end the film before anything else is lost. It's sad that Donald Pleasence's final performance is immortalized in this film, even if the man did the best he could under the worst possible conditions. And for the most part, there's other strong cast-members in this film. Paul Rudd plays the weird, anti-social adult Tommy Doyle rather naturally while Marianne Hagan does a fair job at portraying the sympathetic female lead. On the other side of the coin, the re-casting of Jamie Lloyd was a shame, and thank God Devin Gardner doesn't do movies anymore. As the child in the film being pursued by the Man in Black, Danny is the anti-Jamie in that he is annoying, whiny and absolutely unbelievable in his role. It's sad when you can't even feel sympathy for a child in a horror film. But I guess that's Halloween 6 in a nutshell. Essentially, this is the anti-Halloween, made by a director who didn't know what he was doing and a studio that had their own agenda. Hell, even the music is bad. Many will try to paint this as the edgy-Halloween because of it's sci-fi twist, but really, it's just stupid. Save for some good visuals and decent characters, The Curse Of Michael Myers is just about as bad as it gets. And this is coming from a fan!

Some say it was just an accident, others are convinced that it was a wide reaching conspiracy set in place to remove a person uncomfortable for the ruling regime. The film follows the investigation and the unraveling of the events that led up to this event. What I really like about this film is the realism and relative neutrality.

Things are shown from an observational standpoint, rather than an emotional one. Even though it is evident which side the filmmakers are on, I really liked how the motives for the other side were explained as well and not in a slapdash manner but quite honestly. The plot line is not something as far fetched as something from most Hollywood films but very down to earth and realistic.

He never looks bad on screen (even in Copland he is captivating as a deeply scared and mostly silent sheriff). I was also raised on the high octane action thrillers of producer Joel Silver and direct Richard Donner. My teen years were gung ho and visceral in terms of film going.Something drab happened in the 1990's though. Mood was mistaken for entertainment instead of mise en scene. And as a result a clutch of thrillers simply did not work. The Assassin (Point Of No Return) the remake of the French Nikita was slow and despite having Bridget Fonda and Gabrielle Byrne it lacked edge, and John Badham's use of slo-mo worked against the films action instead of for it. Then came Stallone's own tepid simmer (hardly thriller) with Sharon Stone - The Specialist. This is best remembered for two things 1) the hilarious sex scene between the He-Man Stallone and the Barbie Stone (really funny for how awful it is); 2) the ubiquitous scene-chewing James Woods who has a ball as the bad-guy, in this laughable and yet boring fiasco. Always suspect in any film is a voice over - like they forget something and had to make sense of it (Re the ill-advised Bladerunner VO), only here it is the terrible and completely unbelievable telephone calls between Stone and Stallone that play over otherwise banal surveillance shots of Stallone stalking the Colombian mafia on Stone's behalf. The whole films might have worked better without the calls. Oh well.And then came Assassins. Admittedly a step up from The Specialist, but not far. Julianne Moore's character comes over as a completely asynchronous character as she is not clever (which she is supposed to be), but is too old to be as ditsy as she plays it. Stallone does have more action to play with and the film's flaws are not his fault. The problem comes in the last half of the film when the pace is slowed so much it feels like it will never end. The problem is that the first half has a fair amount of action in it, whereas the last half is a tense setup. This simply does not work as we feel let down by the lack of action. A film tilted the other way might work more, but it's never going to work as a tense ending when the heartbeat in the first half was quite simply beating faster. The result, although competently directed, is an uneven film which ultimately lets you down.I would really like Stallone to do another Specialist\/Assassin film today, where he comes out of retirement for something personal (I know that's the story of Rocky Balboa\/Rambo IV, but if it ain't broke...). I think he could redeem himself of these studio blips (I see big thumb prints all over these pictures), so long as he wrote and directed the film himself. Stallone is a very good actor who has been caught in a niche market (despite trying to break free of it) for three decades. He is also a good writer and director. If he took some time over this one it could be another hit for the iconic star.Please redeem yourself Sly. I shall wait with baited breath.

As others have pointed out, it's darker and more serious. Before watching it, I had read about those differences, so I was prepared for what wouldn't be typical for James Bond (at least not for the movies, I don't know about the books), which may have been a good thing. Around the beginning, it seemed to me like it was working, and it looked like it would be superior to Dalton's first outing as Bond, 1987's The Living Daylights, which some think it is, but for me, it got less intriguing as it went along.After James Bond and CIA agent Felix Leiter capture drug lord Franz Sanchez, they immediately go to Felix' wedding, where he is to marry a woman named Della Churchill, and Bond is his best man. Unfortunately, Sanchez manages to escape, and after the wedding, the couple are captured by henchmen of Sanchez! After Bond finds out about Sanchez's escape, he soon finds Della dead and Felix seriously injured! Now seeking revenge, he plans to track down Sanchez, but MI6 are not concerned about the drug lord and M tells him to move on to his next assignment. So, Bond resigns and is stripped of his license to kill. He then continues on a personal vendetta, determined to have his revenge on the criminals, but unlike any of his previous missions, he is on this one as an outlaw, no longer working for the government, so the criminals he is after are not the only ones who are against him!The beginning of the film looks promising, with the drug bust, and the film doesn't falter with the wedding. Also, the action and drama that ensues when things get ugly keeps the film going steadily for a while. It didn't fail to make me feel the tension, and the scene where Bond finds Della dead and Felix in critical condition definitely moved me. No, it's not the kind of scene you would usually see in a Bond film, but that's not necessarily a bad thing, if you realize this isn't exactly a typical film in the franchise. Aside from learning about how dark this movie was before I watched it, I also read that it was devoid of any humour, and after watching the film, I pretty much agree with that (some very mild humour that occasionally made me smile, but certainly not even much of that), not that I'm complaining. If the action and drama could keep the film going steadily, it could have turned out to be the best Bond film in quite a while, but unfortunately, during the movie's long run, it gradually spirals downhill, with a rather poor performance from Carey Lowell as Bond's ally, Pam Bouvier. There's lots of action in the film, but it doesn't usually tend to work, and like a number of previous Bond films, this one seems a bit too long. The once intriguing revenge story gets a little tiresome.With a different kind of premise, Bond doing something he had never done in the movies before, turning against Her Majesty's Secret Service for a personal vendetta, which may not seem like something he would ever do, some fans obviously don't like this film. However, this premise didn't tend to bother me, and maybe if you don't exactly look at this as another Bond film, but more as a dark revenge story, it just might help. Still, while it looked like this film would really do it for me, it was disappointing, and I'm going to have to disagree with those who say this is the superior of Dalton's two films in the franchise. Neither are the best, but I think this one is slightly inferior. That obviously doesn't mean you'll think the same, you could be very impressed with this different type of Bond. For me, however, it looked like it was going to work (it looked like I would be able to rate it 8\/10 around the beginning), but there aren't too many other Bond films I've seen that I can say seemed very good around the beginning and then stumbled and couldn't redeem themselves.

Meanwhile Sutek the ancient Eygptian God whom Toulon stole the reanimation secret from in the first place wants it back & sends various little monsters out to get it & kill anyone who has learned about it starting with Rick, his chums & Toulon's puppets...Originally having the working title Puppet Master 4 The Demon this was directed by sequel specialist Jeff Burr whose other credits include Stepfather II (1989), Leatherface Texas Chainsaw Massacre III (1990), Pumpinhead II Blood Wings (1994) as well as the following Puppet Master sequel Puppet Master 5 (1994) which was actually made at the same time as Puppet Master 4 & continues the story with pretty much the same cast of actor's & character's (here in the UK ironically Puppet Master 5 was the only one never to be released on video or DVD so that means the only Puppet Master to follow on directly from the previous one storyline wise was never released!). I must admit that I am a huge fan of the first three Puppet Master flicks which I consider to be Full Moon's best films with some strong storytelling, neat special effects & gore & some memorable killer puppets each with their own distinct personality & implement's for killing but this is the point where that stops & the Puppet Master series starts to turn into a cheap horror franchise aimed at making money & selling replica dolls to the fans. Amazingly Puppet Master 4 has five credited on screen writers which I find astonishing, I mean it took five people to write this? While there are elements of the screenplay & plot that I like I have to say some of this sucks big time & some of the plot elements that are newly introduced like the Egyptian God Sutek, the laser fights & the scientific artificial intelligence angle are poor. Event at only 75 minutes long not much actually happens, out of the four main teenage cast members only one is killed & I didn't like the fact that the Toulon puppets don't get to do anything & aren't used as the main threat which ends up falling to Sutek's little monsters which are forgettable & don't have any particular stand out features.A lot of the previous Puppet Master films continuity is forgotten about or ignored here as well, I mean where's Torch from Puppet Master II (1991) which this follows? Although having said that Torch does appear in Puppet Master 5. The character of Andre Toulon has been completely rewritten & changed which doesn't help & the puppets which were once so cool & so deadly are turned into the hero's here & actually protect Rick & his mates from Sutek. The majority of the special effects are surprisingly good with simple yet very effective stop-motion animation & animatronic puppet effects used throughout, I just wish the puppets were meaner & had been given more to do. The only really terrible effect is the awful rubber monster suit that is supposed to pass as Sutek the Demon God. The gore levels are low, someone has their finger cut off & there's some mild blood splatter but this feels like it was made for a PG rating & if there hadn't been some 'F' word swearing it would surely have gotten that PG rating.Production wise Puppet Master 4 is pretty good, the wonderful location used for the Bodega Bay Inn scenes really help as I'm sure the production team would have struggled to build sets that were half as good & anywhere near as atmospheric. The cinematography is quite nice on occasion with some moody lighting & a power cut coupled with a good thunder storm going on outside with sporadic lightning flashes always helps the feel. The acting is alright by a fairly young & attractive cast (especially the two leading girls who are hot!) most of whom return for the next one Puppet Master 5.Puppet Master 4 has a few good points like the return of the puppets & some nice special effects & one or two good moments but it's nowhere near as good as the first three & you can tell the producers are milking the franchise & see it as a money making exercise rather than anything else, or maybe I'm just being too cynical? Splitting what would have sat happily as one long film into two 70 odd minute ones along with turning the once killer puppets into the good guy's & reducing the gore & nudity to virtually zero probably say's it all really.

Susie notices a strange puppet & Rick say's it's been there since he moved in, then Lauren feels something evil about it & leads the friends to a large chest in a forgotten storage room & several other strange puppets inside it as well as the diary of German toymaker & puppeteer Andre Toulon (Guy Rolfe) which describes a green serum which can animate the puppets & give them life which by an odd coincidence is just the thing that Rick is working on. Meanwhile Sutek the ancient Eygptian God whom Toulon stole the reanimation secret from in the first place wants it back & sends various little monsters out to get it & kill anyone who has learned about it starting with Rick, his chums & Toulon's puppets...Originally having the working title Puppet Master 4 The Demon this was directed by sequel specialist Jeff Burr whose other credits include Stepfather II (1989), Leatherface Texas Chainsaw Massacre III (1990), Pumpinhead II Blood Wings (1994) as well as the following Puppet Master sequel Puppet Master 5 (1994) which was actually made at the same time as Puppet Master 4 & continues the story with pretty much the same cast of actor's & character's (here in the UK ironically Puppet Master 5 was the only one never to be released on video or DVD so that means the only Puppet Master to follow on directly from the previous one storyline wise was never released!). I must admit that I am a huge fan of the first three Puppet Master flicks which I consider to be Full Moon's best films with some strong storytelling, neat special effects & gore & some memorable killer puppets each with their own distinct personality & implement's for killing but this is the point where that stops & the Puppet Master series starts to turn into a cheap horror franchise aimed at making money & selling replica dolls to the fans. Amazingly Puppet Master 4 has five credited on screen writers which I find astonishing, I mean it took five people to write this? While there are elements of the screenplay & plot that I like I have to say some of this sucks big time & some of the plot elements that are newly introduced like the Egyptian God Sutek, the laser fights & the scientific artificial intelligence angle are poor. Event at only 75 minutes long not much actually happens, out of the four main teenage cast members only one is killed & I didn't like the fact that the Toulon puppets don't get to do anything & aren't used as the main threat which ends up falling to Sutek's little monsters which are forgettable & don't have any particular stand out features.A lot of the previous Puppet Master films continuity is forgotten about or ignored here as well, I mean where's Torch from Puppet Master II (1991) which this follows? Although having said that Torch does appear in Puppet Master 5. The character of Andre Toulon has been completely rewritten & changed which doesn't help & the puppets which were once so cool & so deadly are turned into the hero's here & actually protect Rick & his mates from Sutek. The majority of the special effects are surprisingly good with simple yet very effective stop-motion animation & animatronic puppet effects used throughout, I just wish the puppets were meaner & had been given more to do.

His little speech to Big John is actually very funny, as are most of the scenes with this horse. Sanders as Samuel Yoder was okay, but he did not behave the way we all know the Amish do, and that did not sit too well with me. So, if you can set aside the fact that what happens really would never happen, and this includes running away from the IRS, then just sit back and enjoy the ride.

I can only think it is the religious angle of the story, that the Church seems to accept that Regan is indeed possessed by a demon from Hell, thereby giving the film some verisimilitude.The Exorcist is a well-made film, decently acted and directed, but time has not been kind to it. Unlike The Wicker Man or Don't Look Now, which were both released in the same year, the film simply never succeeds in really getting under your skin.During the first hour or so the story is generally presented along realistic lines, although it does seem to take a long time to get going and there are little moments of supernaturalism - the sounds in the loft, the Ouija board, etc.However once the demon is revealed the whole thing slides into self-parody. It's rather obvious that Linda Blair is overdubbed with entirely different dialogue during the profanity exchanges. Blair is very convincing for the most part, giving a performance that type-cast her in sub-basement horror films for years afterwards. Yet the presentation simply never convinces you - seeming to be just an excuse for some mechanical Hollywood effects, pea soup projectile vomiting (which actually looks extremely fake - like the goop they used to drop on people in TISWAS)and the bed is obviously being pulled up and down on wires, as is Regan in her levitation bit. DVD sharpness reveals this rather poor effect.However some of the film does work, Karras suddenly being confronted by his recently-deceased mother in Regan's place, is a spooky and unsettling moment, and Father Merrin's entrance to the McNeil home is justifiably famous, caught in silhouette against an unearthly light from Regan's window. If only the rest of the film had been as subtle.I have to say when judged against it's contemporaries, it simply isn't as good, is too slow and suffers from a rather undeveloped plot. The Omen maybe a cruder film but it is a much more effective one. The Exorcist is an important film historically, then, but not in terms of quality.

It appears as though he has lost his memory too, except for an uncanny ability to name every song he hears. Almásy loves to sing, as he is told throughout the film, in both his past and present, so this trick is not too out of place. He is on his last leg, the crash left him close to death, and eventually the military caravan he is apart of goes on while he and his nurse stay holed up in an abandoned Italian Villa. The nurse, Hana, has seen her own bits of tragedy during the war as her love was killed and then her best friend, seconds after talking to her, is blown up by a land mine. Everyone she loves seems to be perishing around her, so to get away with her patient is an appealing answer to the grief and anger bottled inside. The two are very alike, especially after we hear Almásy speaking of his wife, who we can only assume was the woman in the plane with him when it crashes. We won't know the truth until we delve into the dreamstate memories of his past, the years leading up to the point he is at now. His days as a mapmaker in Africa and the affairs and dealings he participates in once the war breaks.There are a lot of timeline maneuvering, but it's always grounded through our lead character Almásy. Ralph Fiennes is either under burn victim prosthetics (the present) or shown whole in the desert (the past). The surrounding roles also help as we soon realize the instances with Kristen Scott Thomas delineate the past from those moments with Juliette Binoche's Hana, caring for our lead in Italy. The way Fiennes dreams all his flashbacks make it tough for we the audience to decide whether he has amnesia or is just faking it to try and forget the past&#151;an idea set forth by Willem Dafoe's mysterious Caravaggio, a man that is not telling the complete truth, yet entrenching himself in the middle of the action. His past shows him in the deserts converting photographs into maps for the British army to use for the war that is brewing. It is a life of work amongst men and friends until a couple benefactors, one a photographer, come to visit. The arrival of Geoffrey and Katharine Clifton (Colin Firth and Scott Thomas respectively) turns the entire dynamic on its head. Fiennes' strict bachelor finds a woman who fascinates him. A strong, educated, and independent one that just might feel the same about him.This is not just any affair, though, but instead one with dire consequences. Those that Almásy and Katharine touch will all be affected because of the war and the sides that are forming. What was once a world of equality and kinship, with multiple ethnicities and nationalities all teaming up on the cartology project, becomes one of enemies and allies on opposite ends of a harsh brutal battle. The reverberations from their trysts are felt for years to come as grudges stay held and alliances are made. Why does Almásy keep referring to a wife when we know he never has one? What relationship does Caravaggio truly hold with him, if any? Why are he and Katharine flying in territory that risked them getting shot down and killed? There are so many questions for which hinge on Almásy remembering his past. We want him to remember because we want to know what happened to bring him to where he is, alone and disfigured, only wanting one more day in the rain before he dies.But it is not all about this journey. We also are treated to Binoche's Hana's evolution as a woman trying to survive a war that appears to kill everyone she holds dear. What was to be a retreat of isolation beside her patient becomes a boarding house for Dafoe's character as well as a team of bomb diffusers led by Naveen Andrews' Kip. Everyone's favorite Iraqi torturer from Lost was billed higher than Firth in an Oscar winning film back in 1996. Where has he been since? I don't know, but I'm glad he has returned to the scene because he shows again here that he deserves to be. An Indian Sikh, he becomes the person that could show Hana she is not cursed. He can be a love that won't go away, one to break her from the shell she has hidden herself behind. Theirs becomes a relationship that mirrors Almásy's own with Katharine, allowing his thoughts to dwell on that happy time and eventually let spill what really happened.Six people's lives intertwine through over a decade in Europe and Africa, meeting accidentally and purposely with both large and small results. Each has a hand in the future of the other, whether they are aware of it or not. One move by any of them can be a life or death decision for the rest. As a result, this story could have become contrived to the point of absurdity in order to make it all happen. However, this fact is what makes the film so successful, because it never falls into that trap. The English Patient is natural and fluid throughout its lengthy duration with each coincidence and uncovered secret seeming to be as realistic as possible. I never once doubted the activities nor motives of any involved and while it may drag a bit around the hour and a half mark, the final 45 minutes or so make up for everything. Something can be said for the hidden truth being revealed after so much anticipation and buildup. Minghella took the novel and crafted a riveting piece of romantic drama, captivating its audience and delivering on every promise &#133; absolutely.

The reverberations from their trysts are felt for years to come as grudges stay held and alliances are made. Why does Almásy keep referring to a wife when we know he never has one? What relationship does Caravaggio truly hold with him, if any? Why are he and Katharine flying in territory that risked them getting shot down and killed? There are so many questions for which hinge on Almásy remembering his past. We want him to remember because we want to know what happened to bring him to where he is, alone and disfigured, only wanting one more day in the rain before he dies.But it is not all about this journey. We also are treated to Binoche's Hana's evolution as a woman trying to survive a war that appears to kill everyone she holds dear. What was to be a retreat of isolation beside her patient becomes a boarding house for Dafoe's character as well as a team of bomb diffusers led by Naveen Andrews' Kip. Everyone's favorite Iraqi torturer from Lost was billed higher than Firth in an Oscar winning film back in 1996. Where has he been since? I don't know, but I'm glad he has returned to the scene because he shows again here that he deserves to be. An Indian Sikh, he becomes the person that could show Hana she is not cursed. He can be a love that won't go away, one to break her from the shell she has hidden herself behind. Theirs becomes a relationship that mirrors Almásy's own with Katharine, allowing his thoughts to dwell on that happy time and eventually let spill what really happened.Six people's lives intertwine through over a decade in Europe and Africa, meeting accidentally and purposely with both large and small results. Each has a hand in the future of the other, whether they are aware of it or not. One move by any of them can be a life or death decision for the rest. As a result, this story could have become contrived to the point of absurdity in order to make it all happen. However, this fact is what makes the film so successful, because it never falls into that trap. The English Patient is natural and fluid throughout its lengthy duration with each coincidence and uncovered secret seeming to be as realistic as possible. I never once doubted the activities nor motives of any involved and while it may drag a bit around the hour and a half mark, the final 45 minutes or so make up for everything. Something can be said for the hidden truth being revealed after so much anticipation and buildup. Minghella took the novel and crafted a riveting piece of romantic drama, captivating its audience and delivering on every promise &#133; absolutely.

It appears as though he has lost his memory too, except for an uncanny ability to name every song he hears. Almásy loves to sing, as he is told throughout the film, in both his past and present, so this trick is not too out of place. He is on his last leg, the crash left him close to death, and eventually the military caravan he is apart of goes on while he and his nurse stay holed up in an abandoned Italian Villa. The nurse, Hana, has seen her own bits of tragedy during the war as her love was killed and then her best friend, seconds after talking to her, is blown up by a land mine. Everyone she loves seems to be perishing around her, so to get away with her patient is an appealing answer to the grief and anger bottled inside. The two are very alike, especially after we hear Almásy speaking of his wife, who we can only assume was the woman in the plane with him when it crashes. We won't know the truth until we delve into the dreamstate memories of his past, the years leading up to the point he is at now. His days as a mapmaker in Africa and the affairs and dealings he participates in once the war breaks.There are a lot of timeline maneuvering, but it's always grounded through our lead character Almásy. Ralph Fiennes is either under burn victim prosthetics (the present) or shown whole in the desert (the past). The surrounding roles also help as we soon realize the instances with Kristen Scott Thomas delineate the past from those moments with Juliette Binoche's Hana, caring for our lead in Italy. The way Fiennes dreams all his flashbacks make it tough for we the audience to decide whether he has amnesia or is just faking it to try and forget the past&#151;an idea set forth by Willem Dafoe's mysterious Caravaggio, a man that is not telling the complete truth, yet entrenching himself in the middle of the action. His past shows him in the deserts converting photographs into maps for the British army to use for the war that is brewing. It is a life of work amongst men and friends until a couple benefactors, one a photographer, come to visit. The arrival of Geoffrey and Katharine Clifton (Colin Firth and Scott Thomas respectively) turns the entire dynamic on its head. Fiennes' strict bachelor finds a woman who fascinates him. A strong, educated, and independent one that just might feel the same about him.This is not just any affair, though, but instead one with dire consequences. Those that Almásy and Katharine touch will all be affected because of the war and the sides that are forming.

The acting too was a major problem. The main character just couldn't act properly. She was good in a couple of scenes but just couldn't grab my attention. The other cast members, including Johnny Depp, were just about okay. Freddy was spooky though. I also found Nancy's behavior with her mother rude and irrational as her mother didn't seem so bad to her. The end sequence looked like a Home Alone film. On the bright side, it still manages to get you hooked due to the clever plot. Some of the scenes were well crafted. The best part was it was just a 1 1\/2 hour movie, an ideal time for a horror flick. I'm going to go with a 6 out of 10 for Nightmare on the Elm Street.

Full marks for being one of the best films ever made.It is not historically accurate with the plot but that's not the point (it seems a mash of different events and people who existed at one time or another in during the Roman Empire. From what I know of ancient Rome the story is within the realms of possibility.) The characters are all great. Pheonix is annoying but intentionally so - he acts his character perfectly. The script is kind of poetic at times - it seems it underwent at least three full scale revisions by different masters of script writing.There are a number of different accents in the film but then Rome was probably a pretty multicultural place and we're hardly going to wish they had made it in Latin.

Done in the same vein as Airplane, but too many jokes and gags are misfires to be anywhere near the level of that classic comedy. Where's Leslie Nielsen when you need him? He would have been perfect reprising his doctor role from Airplane! The stars, Michael McKean and Sean Young, are just okay; going thru the obligatory romance with all the complications.But what really sinks this movie is the utterly tedious romance between dumb-dumb Dr. Litto (Kyle Heffron) and Angelo (played in drag by Hector Elizondo!). A few good one-liners cast off by Elizondo doesn't compensate for the fact that this gag (stupid doctor falling in love with guy in drag he thinks is a woman) goes on FAR too long, and takes itself way too seriously. Making this bore-fest a major sub-plot was a huge mistake of Gerry Marshall. Last time I watched this movie on VHS I fast-forwarded through their dull and unfunny scenes together.Some of the scenes with Dabney Coleman, Harry Dean Stanton, and Michael Kramer Richards work good, but they are too few and far between. When this was released in 1982 my Mom loved seeing all her ABC daytime soap favorites in cameos, but they're given precious little to do, as is British great Patrick Macnee. John Dr. Steve Hardy Beradino, for instance, is in one quickie scene, and if you happen to sneeze at that time, you'll miss him! Instead of wasting a third of the running time on the Dr Litto\/Angelo romance, why didn't Gerry Marshall have all these cameo stars doing more comedy skits throughout the movie??? Considering the vast talent associated with this movie, including future stars and soap-opera legends, this movie should have been far, far better.
