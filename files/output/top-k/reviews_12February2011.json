It sure has quite a few flaws and doesn't hold up to many perhaps most of Spielberg's other movies. Even with the many problems I still feel Hey it's not that bad! Actually I don't think it's bad at all, sure could have been better but it's still very good entertainment. Steven Spielbergs forgotten grain of gold. I really like the idea of Peter Pan growing up and forgetting everything, very interesting take on the tale. The movie starts out great feeling mysterious and dark toned. The cast is not entirely satisfying. I agree with most that Julia Roberts is really miss cast as Tinker Bell and I think Robin Williams is not the perfect choice as Pan but he works, Dame Maggie Smith is great as always but she isn't in the film much. The villains make the greatest performances Dustin Hoffman steals the show from the hero and Bob Hoskins is brilliant as Smee. When the film gets to Neverland is when a little dubious feeling sets in. What is meant to be an fantasy island looks way to much as a big set, not convincing. The lost boys are OK even though they don't make the best impression and performance throughout the film. This Neverland tale is very different from the original Disney most know, feels like something else completely. Even if I really like the idea of the story the execution of it has many problems. For a big production the plot has a ridiculous lot things that don't make much sense. Many obvious plot holes (why is Peter sleeping in the snow at the end when the kids flew into the house?) but also some major ones (Why does he grow to like a teenager if Ting took him to Neverland when he was a baby?). Much of the dialogue is very cheesy(My Jack?) but still the overly sentimental stuff(I wish I had a dad like you) doesn't ruin much for me at least. The plot could have been carried out more successfully but deep within the story has some pretty sentimental points that work well. The action scenes are fun to watch even much of them also are pretty dumb like that the pirates attack Pan one at a time, still it's superb entertainment and the sword fights has a nicely working theatre feel to them. The film has it fun parts but I think it has more of a sad tone to most of it and specially at the end(Peter leaves Neverland forever). The story is definitively not wooden or empty rather the opposite it has heart and like stated earlier even an emotional depth. John Williams fantastic music greatly contributes, he is absolutely one of the best composers and for Hook he is just as good as usual. Some have said they liked this film when they were young but realised it was pretty weak when they grew older. Not so with me I feel just as joyed as I used to after seeing it. A feel-good film for everyone young, older and family. Is this a film that you either hate or love? Maybe some would say that but I don't and I admit it has many mistakes but still I like Hook.Hook has many misses and could have been more successful in more than one or two ways. If one looks at Spielberg's entire filmography it's among the weaker ones but it doesn't mean that it's not any good. For me Hook is somewhat of a classic.Peter, don't you know who you are?

The Coen Brothers themselves have been quoted as saying that the title references the fictional book of the same name in Preston Sturges' 1941 film Sullivan's Travels. In this earlier movie, John Sullivan, a movie producer, is on a search for a better movie based on the adaptation of the fictional book, O Brother Where Art Thou. This title is itself an allusion to the novels of Steinbeck and ultimately even to the story of Cain and Abel in the book of genesis. In the Coens' movie, O Brother Where art thou, the characters are on a search for literal treasure. In neither of these movies do the characters find what they are looking for. The viewer too, may not find precisely what they are looking for. Indeed, if one expected to find a story as fine as Gulliver's Travels or one whose moral is as universal as the story of Caine and Abel, Sullivan's travels would fall short. As would any viewer be disappointed if they expected the movie O Brother, where art thou to be, as the character John Sullivan would, a serious movie that about the plight of the downtrodden. following the trail of these allusions places the viewer too on kind of treasure hunt, never ultimately finding what we are looking for.The most overt allusion that the movie draws from, The Odyssey, seems conversely to give the viewer the most treasure. Odysseus is there in the veil of Everett Ulysses McGill as are his shipmates and family. The angry gods make appearances, as do the sirens, the Cyclops and many more. However, the quality and scope of these characters seems to have degenerated throughout the ages. Instead of Odysseus (Ulysses in Latin) the great king overcoming great woes to guide his men home and return to his loving family, we are presented with Everett, a two-bit con man who fools his men into helping him return to his estranged family. The family too seems degenerate. Odysseus' wife is utterly faithful and goes to all length to fight off her suitors. His son is a brave prince who tries everything to find his father. Everett's wife Penny, on the other hand, is ashamed of her estranged husband. She lies to her daughters and tells them that Everett has been hit by a train, and plans to marry her suitor. After seeing her, Everett even calls her a succubus. The Coens seem to have gone out of their way to deprive the characters of O Brother Where Art Thou of any vestige of the heroism and greatness that their forebears once possessed. A one-eyed bible salesman has replaced the great Cyclops, the sirens are now just highway robbers and ancient Greece has become 1930's Mississippi. Even the comic narrative of O Brother Where Art Thou proves inferior in quality to that of the epic Odyssey. In framing their degenerate narrative in such sharp contrast to the heroic Odyssey, the Coens do more than invite comparison. They have re-formed the Odyssey and emerged with something poignantly less. In doing so, they seem to hint at the fact that reform is not synonymous with progress.This idea is one that recurs again and again in the movie, but never as noticeably as in the side-story of Pappy O'Daniel. Pappy, is the governor of Mississippi. Pappy is shown to be a fat autocrat. However, his opponent, Homor Stokes, the reform candidate, is shown to be much worse. He is, in fact the leader of the KKK. We even find out that the nature of Homer's political reform is to combat racial integration in Mississippi. Again, we see the idea of reform leading to a reversal of progress.One notable exception to this idea comes in the form of radio. No doubt, the radio represents a reformation of technology, and yet it also is a positive image in this movie. Everett and his men are helped in a way that Odysseus could not be by the power of mass communication. The Suggy Bottom Boys are first made famous by their songs on the radio and then later use radio to vanquish Homor Stokes. No doubt, radio is a prime example of how re-formation can be positive. O Brother Where Art Thou does not seem to present the idea of reform as strictly positive or negative. Instead, we are offered a different image that of manic depression. This notion is made manifest in the movie by the character of Baby Face Nelson.In the last scene of the movie, we are presented with an image of a flood washing away a valley. Everett explains that the entire state will be put on hydroelectricity, which will bring in an age of reason and put an end to backward ways. Indeed, the viewer knows that Everett's prophecy has come true. Since the 1940's America has been re-formed by electricity. However, given the ambivalence with which the movie treats the idea of reform, perhaps Everett's optimism is premature. It is ultimately left to the viewer to decide whether the vast reform of America brought about by technology is, like radio, a cultural progression, or else like the narrative of the movie itself, a step-backwards.

Terms of Endearment is basically a big, glossy soap opera with a strong cast and clichéd script. This production doesn't disguise the fact that it is exactly that. The central character is an overbearing and domineering matriarch played by Shirley McLaine, and the story deals with her daughter's problems and her own awkward relationship with the astronaut next door. Yep, you heard that right. Jack Nicholson plays an astronaut living next door in her Houston neighborhood. His name.... (please hold your laughter) Garret Breedlove! What a name! What a guy! Of course he is this womanizing loner when he isn't out in space. Do you think he and Shirley will be able to find common ground?? It really doesn't matter since the more interesting parts deal with the daughter (Debra Winger) and her disastrous marriage to a conniving English professor (Jeff Daniels). The marriage is a joke from the start, and things only get worse for Winger as she later develops a Hollywood-type cancer later that we learn little about.

It's good, really good, but not quite his absolute best. It just barely misses being Woody Allen's overall finest achievement by only the slimmest of faults, but in terms of purely formal technique, it is a soaring triumph. Gordon Willis' widescreen cinematography is absolutely stunning. The use of black and white effectively unmoors New York from its modern (1979?!) berth, setting it adrift in time to freely conjure deeply nostalgic impressions. Profoundly luscious monochromatic contours, contrasts and textures carry our thoughts back through the city's fabled heritage. The grandeur and majesty of the world's most glamorous urban jungle is meticulously rendered in jaw dropping, sparkling skyline panoramas and sumptuous, bristling, street level vistas - impeccably lit and framed, creating the compelling illusion that only by divine prescience had all of it been brought into existence expressly, exclusively, for these exact cinematic moments. By right of these astonishingly masterful portraits, Woody Allen has claimed full and absolute ownership of his cherished Manhattan.Like a supremely proud deed holder, the camera confidently surveys patinated brownstone doorways and gleaming plate glass facades. That's his spirit and soul we see in the billowing, contorting steam clouds that shroud the evening boulevards and garnish weather beaten rooftops. The quick flashes of eyes and teeth and hands in an infinite array of furtive, frantic, and facile gestures; The softened clink and clunk of one hundred thousand smartly coordinated restaurants, cafes, trattorias, delis, bars, grills, burger joints and soda shops; the intricately synchronized ballet of the herky jerky taxicabs, delivery trucks, buses, cars, scooters, bikes, and people, so very many people; these are the basic units, the irreducible atoms, that compose his private universe. These gorgeous images are Woody's most heartfelt homage to this most unique, remarkable, bewildering place that so thrills him, so nurtures him, so comforts him. This intimidating locale, this impossibly evolved borough, looks so tastefully raw, so elegantly primal. It's wonderfully clear just exactly who is the deserving star of this film.A not-quite-as-clear part is the curious story that's loaded onto this sumptuous stage. It's more than a little creepy to witness the statutory molestation of the divinely cherubic Mariel Hemingway character, Tracy. Yes, as a red blooded, often virile, usually horny, standard issue male, I was viscerally moved by her angelic porcelain beauty, but my inappropriate desire was sharply chastened by a pious inner voice. That imagined voice was resonant with every overly concerned father, brother, uncle, coach, counselor, friend, foe, cop, judge and jury who's ever deigned to remind some poor sorry slob of just how heinous a moral, ethical, and legal transgression is this sort of liaison. She's too damn young!! I was being c*%$ blocked by my own vigilant conscience, but Woody - disturbingly - was vigorously proceeding with his assault, even after having repeatedly declared this obvious truth to her and himself.Tracy is a tender 17 years old, and relative to Isaac's (Woody's) 42, she might as well be 10. I'm being hyperbolic, I know, but that's the thing with our morality - it doesn't make any accommodations for art (or reason). It is a very risky gamble, his being so rather casual about something so potentially alienating. In daring to portray so frankly this carnal attraction for the naive and innocent teen Woody is abiding by his personal mandate for authenticity in all aspects of his art. Just as he expects that his cherished town fully expose herself to his unblinking lens, he demands the utmost honesty of himself. He certainly doesn't try to obscure this full frontal view of his own engorged lust. It's almost sinister, how cavalier is his lasciviousness. However, by the anesthetizing splendor of his oh-so-seductive cityscapes we are partly deflected from the deeply repulsive discomfort elicited by his sexual indiscretion. In spite if his lofty aspirations for impeccable integrity, Woody is exploiting the tremendous allure of his mesmerizing visuals to gain approval for his questionable behavior. Just as someone who has squandered an absurd sum of cash in Las Vegas may be granted a modicum of pity - It happens to everyone who goes there! - so too is Woody petitioning our sympathy for his ignoble sexual conundrum by having it play out in such an irresistibly provocative setting. The expression When in Rome... comes to mind, and Woody's Rome is indeed a haven for some very unconventional, odd, illicit, destructive, depraved and neurotic lifestyles. I was almost expecting Woody, at any point, to face the camera and say Look folks, I know you don't approve of me shtupping this sweet kid, but c'mon, this is New York... It's this slight but critical manipulation that ultimately undermines this masterpiece's claim to supremacy in the Allen canon.If Woody counted on me to identify with an aging, nebbishy, self obsessed, overly critical cradle robber, then he really set a major task for himself. What's so remarkable is just how much of that daunting mission he actually accomplishes, just how very far he's pulled me along on his morally tenuous trek.

Gordon Willis' widescreen cinematography is absolutely stunning. The use of black and white effectively unmoors New York from its modern (1979?!) berth, setting it adrift in time to freely conjure deeply nostalgic impressions. Profoundly luscious monochromatic contours, contrasts and textures carry our thoughts back through the city's fabled heritage. The grandeur and majesty of the world's most glamorous urban jungle is meticulously rendered in jaw dropping, sparkling skyline panoramas and sumptuous, bristling, street level vistas - impeccably lit and framed, creating the compelling illusion that only by divine prescience had all of it been brought into existence expressly, exclusively, for these exact cinematic moments. By right of these astonishingly masterful portraits, Woody Allen has claimed full and absolute ownership of his cherished Manhattan.Like a supremely proud deed holder, the camera confidently surveys patinated brownstone doorways and gleaming plate glass facades. That's his spirit and soul we see in the billowing, contorting steam clouds that shroud the evening boulevards and garnish weather beaten rooftops. The quick flashes of eyes and teeth and hands in an infinite array of furtive, frantic, and facile gestures; The softened clink and clunk of one hundred thousand smartly coordinated restaurants, cafes, trattorias, delis, bars, grills, burger joints and soda shops; the intricately synchronized ballet of the herky jerky taxicabs, delivery trucks, buses, cars, scooters, bikes, and people, so very many people; these are the basic units, the irreducible atoms, that compose his private universe. These gorgeous images are Woody's most heartfelt homage to this most unique, remarkable, bewildering place that so thrills him, so nurtures him, so comforts him. This intimidating locale, this impossibly evolved borough, looks so tastefully raw, so elegantly primal. It's wonderfully clear just exactly who is the deserving star of this film.A not-quite-as-clear part is the curious story that's loaded onto this sumptuous stage. It's more than a little creepy to witness the statutory molestation of the divinely cherubic Mariel Hemingway character, Tracy. Yes, as a red blooded, often virile, usually horny, standard issue male, I was viscerally moved by her angelic porcelain beauty, but my inappropriate desire was sharply chastened by a pious inner voice. That imagined voice was resonant with every overly concerned father, brother, uncle, coach, counselor, friend, foe, cop, judge and jury who's ever deigned to remind some poor sorry slob of just how heinous a moral, ethical, and legal transgression is this sort of liaison. She's too damn young!! I was being c*%$ blocked by my own vigilant conscience, but Woody - disturbingly - was vigorously proceeding with his assault, even after having repeatedly declared this obvious truth to her and himself.Tracy is a tender 17 years old, and relative to Isaac's (Woody's) 42, she might as well be 10. I'm being hyperbolic, I know, but that's the thing with our morality - it doesn't make any accommodations for art (or reason). It is a very risky gamble, his being so rather casual about something so potentially alienating. In daring to portray so frankly this carnal attraction for the naive and innocent teen Woody is abiding by his personal mandate for authenticity in all aspects of his art. Just as he expects that his cherished town fully expose herself to his unblinking lens, he demands the utmost honesty of himself. He certainly doesn't try to obscure this full frontal view of his own engorged lust. It's almost sinister, how cavalier is his lasciviousness. However, by the anesthetizing splendor of his oh-so-seductive cityscapes we are partly deflected from the deeply repulsive discomfort elicited by his sexual indiscretion. In spite if his lofty aspirations for impeccable integrity, Woody is exploiting the tremendous allure of his mesmerizing visuals to gain approval for his questionable behavior. Just as someone who has squandered an absurd sum of cash in Las Vegas may be granted a modicum of pity - It happens to everyone who goes there! - so too is Woody petitioning our sympathy for his ignoble sexual conundrum by having it play out in such an irresistibly provocative setting. The expression When in Rome... comes to mind, and Woody's Rome is indeed a haven for some very unconventional, odd, illicit, destructive, depraved and neurotic lifestyles. I was almost expecting Woody, at any point, to face the camera and say Look folks, I know you don't approve of me shtupping this sweet kid, but c'mon, this is New York... It's this slight but critical manipulation that ultimately undermines this masterpiece's claim to supremacy in the Allen canon.If Woody counted on me to identify with an aging, nebbishy, self obsessed, overly critical cradle robber, then he really set a major task for himself. What's so remarkable is just how much of that daunting mission he actually accomplishes, just how very far he's pulled me along on his morally tenuous trek.

Powerful as it is you definitely get the sense that a great deal was lost to appease the censorship zealots. Never is that more evident than in the film's crucial climactic scene in which not only can we not see what happens we can barely even have it hinted at. No doubt this dulls the film's impact. And that's a shame because there is so much to appreciate about the film. It has a great, captivating story and some terrific acting performances. And director Elia Kazan brings it all together so well, all while doing his delicate dance with the censors. Getting this movie, with all its controversial material, made at all in 1951 is a little miracle. Getting it made so well is a really masterful achievement.The first thing that people remember about the film is probably Marlon Brando's portrayal of Stanley Kowalski. And well they should, it's a career-making performance. And a performance unlike most anything else Hollywood had seen up to that time. Brando holds nothing back in bringing the rough, tough brute Stanley to life. It's such a powerful performance, charged with emotion. It's impossible to take your eyes off him, you never know where the next explosion is coming from. Of course we now know what a great star Brando was. At the time though he was essentially an unknown. In 1951 the star of this film was Vivien Leigh. And with her portrayal of faded, troubled Southern belle Blanche DuBois she matches Brando stride for stride. Blanche is no doubt a complicated character, certainly a challenging part to play. And Leigh captures the character, all her pretensions and delusions, perfectly. With Brando and Leigh in top form everyone else is somewhat overshadowed but both Karl Malden and Kim Hunter still managed to pick up Oscars for their supporting work. Malden plays Blanche's suitor Mitch, a bit of a sap but definitely a good guy and a welcome contrast to the boorish Stanley. And Hunter is very good in playing the woman torn between her affection for her sister and her love for the brute whom she just can't quit. Hey Stella!As presented A Streetcar Named Desire is captivating, powerful drama. But in many places not as powerful as it could have been. Not the fault of director Kazan or his wonderful cast though. They did the very best they could while confined to the little box the era's moral police placed them in. Brando's performance in the film has become the stuff of legend. Leigh is absolutely terrific and Malden and Hunter contribute nicely. After all the fine work the actors turned in, after all the twists and turns of the compelling story, it is a shame that the ending had to be so watered-down. It's a film which deserved a better ending than its era allowed it. You may lament what was lost but you can still appreciate what Kazan and his terrific cast managed to give you.

Which is a shame because this movie does have some great moments, such as the scenes where Donnie talks with his imaginary demonic rabbit friend, Frank. For two thirds of the movie I was interested in what was going to happen next, yet when the finale finally came, things fell apart.But first lets talk about what is good about this movie. The cinematography and sets are fantastic, the acting is good for the most part, and there are some really funny scenes, like the scenes about Sparkle Motion.Donnie Darko is about a teenager named Donnie Darko, who apparently has psychological problems. He has an imaginary friend named Frank, who throughout the movie urges him to do bad things, like vandalizing the school, and burning down a motivational speaker's house. The plot of the movie never quite makes sense, especially towards the end. For a majority of the movie I thought that Frank was really just a part of Donnie's imagination. I thought Frank was just Donnie's innermost feelings coming out, but it turns out that Frank is Donnie's sister's boyfriend. Anyone who is an expert on this movie could explain it to me, but it is a bit too coincidental that Frank (the boyfriend Frank) wears the exact same costume as the demonic bunny, and even shows up at one point and urges Donnie to burn down a house. That makes no sense whatsoever! How can the same person be Donnie's imaginary friend AND his sister's boyfriend at the same time?! Not only that major plot hole, but the whole reasoning for why the jet engine falls into Donnie's room at the beginning also makes no sense.

Anyone who is an expert on this movie could explain it to me, but it is a bit too coincidental that Frank (the boyfriend Frank) wears the exact same costume as the demonic bunny, and even shows up at one point and urges Donnie to burn down a house. That makes no sense whatsoever! How can the same person be Donnie's imaginary friend AND his sister's boyfriend at the same time?! Not only that major plot hole, but the whole reasoning for why the jet engine falls into Donnie's room at the beginning also makes no sense. So apparently in this movie, when objects go faster than the speed of light they create a worm hole that somehow transports objects into the past. Confused? So am I. If I am wrong about this it is because I pieced it together form what I remember, so please excuse any incorrect information.Nevertheless, Donnie Darko is a mildly entertaining thriller. If it weren't for the disappointing ending and some scenes that probably should have been cut, Donnie Darko would have gotten a much higher rating, but as it stands, Donnie Darko is a solid movie.7\/10 ","genre":"Drama, Sci-Fi, Thriller"},{"date":"12 February 2011","score":"","review":" Forget about today's bloody awful TV reality shows with their lack of intelligence and countless intrigues and arguments. The Lion in Winter has lies and intrigues too, it was based on real facts and it has a historical theme, beautiful eloquence and the acting duel of the shining ensemble casting with names of great importance like Katharine Hepburn, Peter O'Toole, Anthony Hopkins and Timothy Dalton. The story is set in 1183 AD during King Henry II's (O'Toole) decision of dividing the throne between his three sons who'll all want to inherit it (they're played by Hopkins, John Castle and Nigel Terry). Henry's wife Elanor of Aquitaine (Hepburn, spectacular performance that gave her a third Oscar, tied with Barbra Streisand for Funny Girl) is released of her prison to spend Christmas with the family and with Henry's lover (Jane Merrow) and her brother Philip, King of France (Dalton); and all of this important figures are on a trail of deceptions, greed, villainy, tricks, back stabbings and lies, orchestrating a epical battle of quotes and conversations deciding who'll get the throne in the family.There's some many twists and turns in this Shakespearian plot and in such short time, it is so fast that is very difficult but very intriguing story where's is almost impossible to penetrate in the truth behind the lies; everybody has a card under the sleeve, bluffing all the time to see who gets fooled first. A family with no sense of love or union that uses the word love as something playful and of no importance. Even Eleanor recognizes Every family has its ups and downs but in this case they can only go down. They dared themselves to call themselves as nobles, but they already knew that they were the savages, disguised with titles, names, guns and fortune who only wanted more and more territories to conquer, wishing a eminent war to occur. Based on James Goldman's play (who also wrote the magnificent screenplay for the film), The Lion in Winter it is a wonderful surprise in so many levels that is difficult to pick one thing and say something about it but what I can say is that the great final minutes wasn't the way I thought it could be. Performances of the highest quality here, with a dominating and humored Hepburn; a powerful and angry O'Toole (how come he lost the Oscar for this role?); and the debut performances of Anthony Hopkins and Timothy Dalton (he's really good here, you almost forget his James Bond roles). Anthony Harvey directed a exciting, fascinating, well constructed film whose dialogs and acting were among the best works filmed in the 1960's. It's getting difficult to see masterpieces like this being made now. But at least we had brilliant works like this and we can only pray that they survive a long time in the memory of the viewers. 10\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"12 February 2011","score":"","review":" Forget about today's bloody awful TV reality shows with their lack of intelligence and countless intrigues and arguments.

I think this marks the beginning of the brief reign of the excellent character actor in A roles, that ended recently with Gene Hackman's more or less forced retirement and the domination of CGI and huge budgets. This film also pioneered, perhaps inadvertently, the blurring of fact and fiction, when we see a pre-druggie and pre-incest Mackenzie Phillips playing a sexually precocious preteen.

How so? Good scripting, intelligent casting, great editing (no thanks to Lucas, though). It was also pretty daring to set the film in, more or less, real time at night.

The only thing that does not make sense is how can this gorgeous creature make herself ugly, it is a stretch of the imagination. Hugh Grant plays another one of his naive Englishmen, wanting to get involved with someone out of his league. The surprise in the film is Kristin Scott Thomas, a great actress that amazes in the last part of the film. Tonino Deli Colli photographed the film in dark tones that work well with the story. Vangelis musical score adds texture to the film. The film shows a perverse Roman Polanski playing with the viewer's imagination in this tale of obsession gone wrong.

Afterall, it is very highly rated on everybody's lists of top 100 films. (It does seem to make it on most top 10 ratings also.) The reasons for this are really quite obvious and consequently, little thought, discussion or debate. This is a pity, for putting any work of art should never e exempted from debate, re-examination and, hence, potentially a revision in how we think of it in relationship to us and to Film History.WITH RESPECT TO GWTW and its ranking in various categories, there would appear to be some fluctuation in its ranking. Some would be very high, whereas others wouldn't even finish in the money. Allow us to give a rundown in certain pertinent areas. Later, those of you who are members of our Dad Dearborn's Amaterur Arnchair Director's Guild, can come up with their favourite rankings in kookie kategories. CATEGORY # 1. As an EPIC, GWTW is right up there as it can be. The magnitude of the entire film is colossal and each part of the whole production are done up in a grand scale. The sum of all of these equal much more than those taken individually.CATEGORY # 2. As SOAP OPERA, it again rates up there. We vote it the very undisputed all time winner in this slot. There is a Lion's share of extra curricular activity going on; although its depiction is more suppressed and implied, it's explicit, nonetheless.CATEGORY # 3. Tops as an example of Character Driven drama it is superb. Tgis is no small feat when one considers that the backdrop of the story is The American Civil War and that period following it, known in American History as the Reconstruction.CATEGORY # 4. As far as its rating as a HISTORICAL DRAMA, it would fall somewhere in the middle; not because it doesn't portray the horrors of war, but rather because for reasons of omission. In the book, there is extensive mention of the rise of and subsequent underground activities of the Ku Klux Klan. In the screen adaptation, the Klan is never mentioned, there are no hooded horsemen. That sequence where Captain Rhett Butler uses the ruse of returning a gun shot bearing Ashley Wilkes home under the pretense of their being all drunken disorderly and having been at a house of ill repute (also never mentioned by name) was the only incident mentioned. It was referred to as the raid on a shanty town near Atlanta.ONCE SOMEONE ASKED Buster Keaton which was a better picture, GONE WITH THE WIND or Mr. Keaton's own THE GENERAL (Schenck\/United Artists, 1927).
