[{"date":"19 December 2015","score":"","review":" Patch Adams (1998) Dir Tom Shadyac \/ Cast Robin Williams, Monica Potter, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Bob Gunton, Peter Coyote Based on the true story of Hunter Adams who is self admitted into an institution due to suicide attempts. He is overjoyed when he helps a patient and aims to become a doctor himself. He is given the name Patch after he fixes a leak in a coffee cup. Too bad that he couldn't fix the leak in the screenplay. Familiar plot with an unnecessary scene involving a meat party that serves no other purpose than for Adams to don the white overcoat. The film seems as a take on One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest with an ending that is contrived. Directed by Tom Shadyac who deals with characters of odd behavior who struggle in their place in society. He previously made The Nutty Professor and Liar Liar. Robin Williams is carrying the film as someone who goes from depressed state to reaching a purpose. Monica Potter serves only as a love interest who will meet tragedy. Phillip Seymour Hoffman is flat as Patch's roommate. Bob Gunston plays the stereotypical dean who dislikes Patch's practice and basically has a stick up his ass. Peter Coyote plays a patient whom Patch attempts to cheer up but only succeeds in pissing off. We are given much insight into this individual that deserves better writing. Laughter can be a solution but not when your story is full of clichés.

David Duchovny stars as a surgeon who loses his license after practicing on a patient while on dope. After a shootout at a bar, he assists a wounded individual using a bottle. This impresses a criminal, played by Timothy Hutton who wishes to employ his services. Duchovny is hired to patch up associates who suddenly end up dying. Great setup grows repetitious but the climax is powerful. Andy Wilson directs with insight with an excellent performance from Duchovny. He is seen as a total wipe out whose life spirals downward after losing his license. Now his skill finds new ground that leaves him asking questions and eventually facing right and wrong. Hutton steals the film as a gangster who employs Duchovny's services to dire orders until the two have a great showdown that presents a strong conclusion. Angelina Jolie as Hutton's girlfriend will obviously become romantically linked to Duchovny and become nothing more than a prop. Other roles are flat and serve mainly as fillers or faceless thug criminal drug dealing idiots. The message regards the value of human life and the idea that nobody can play God but we often destroy what God creates.

That's not a feeling you get everyday, especially with a 30 year-old movie you've just recently seen for the first time.As a sequel, it's not a patch on the original; the kids are inconsistent, the family's unbelievably hapless and the jokes don't work. But it's a product of the Reagan '80s and there's some charm in that respect.
