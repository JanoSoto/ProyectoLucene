The WWII-era sets, the fluid photography with a lot of long takes, the lighting and costumes and overall feel are elegant and un-compromised, first frame to last. Second, the idea is fabulous, an all-Black cast and an African-American adaptation of the classic Carmen opera (by the French composure Bizet). The vernacular and the stereotypes might seem worn, or even insulting if you take them wrong (or just take them out of context) but in fact it's in line with that even better, earlier opera, Gershwin's Porgy and Bess. The stereotypes are ones that made sanitized sense equally to White and Black America just as other musicals made sanitized sense to the same audiences. If I sound like an apologist, I'm only responding to attacks on the film (farcical gruesome or dreadful), as being untrue or insensitive to Blacks, by saying that nearly all musicals are incredibly stylized and false, and nearly all movies of this era played with safe, simplified versions of life. No, to be fair to this really interesting movie you need to treat it like you would your own favorite movies from the 1950s, accepting the limitations just as the movie makers did. It's got its own syntax and style, it's own inner set of rules.And within those the performance of the character Carmen by Dorothy Dandridge is incredible. She's on fire, introspective, nuanced, and outrageous. The cast around her is excellent but inevitably uneven, and she stands easily above them in pure performance energy, even over the other big star, Harry Belafonte. All of this said, the beautiful, finely made, early widescreen movie here, Carmen Jones, is lacking some kind of necessary intensity to work. I can't pin down why. From little strains of Bizet that perk it up (like a boxing worker whistling the most famous theme as he works) to the truly perfect photography and editing (maybe too perfect?), the movie has a steady, compelling flow. It's based on a Broadway musical from 1943 (the year the movie is set, as well), and it has the bones of a great drama, if a familiar one (it's still Bizet).What might be the biggest problem is the understandable decision to film it in a realistic way, with song (and minimal dance) numbers inserted relatively seamlessly along the way. This is the standard musical approach from from the early Astaire-Rogers films to the relatively contemporaneous Arthur Freed productions of the early 1950s like Singin' in the Rain. But Carmen, the opera and stage musical, is not a lighthearted romantic comedy. It isn't just escapist entertainment. And the gravitas and drama in it, at the end in particular, doesn't quite work the way it does on the opera stage. You watch Belafonte and Dandridge acting their hearts out, but it has that perfect 1950s movie-making production to remind us that it's a movie, and we are detached in a far different way than watching a stage version, with real people and false settings.But never mind all that--you'll see for yourself how absorbed you get and why not more so.A couple last things. First, the singing voices of the two leads are dubbed (yes!), surprising in Belafonte's case in particular because he was (and is) an accomplished singer. Second, Dandridge and director Preminger were having a longterm affair during the filming and after, and she pulls off what might be the best performance of her life here. Third, the movie was shown to the head of the NAACP before release to check on any problems that might be seen from an African-American point of view (this is 1954, remember) and no objections were raised. By this point, Preminger had been working with an all Black cast and was in close quarters with the leading lady so he must have had some sense that what he was after was on target for the time.Watch it if you have interest in any of these things--WWII civilian life, Dandridge or Belafonte, opera adaptations into movies, early big budget African-American movies, Preminger movies, or terrific early Cinemascope photography. That should cover a lot of viewers, but not all. For me, I liked it a lot, and liked parts of it enormously (like the short clip of Max Roach drumming away on a barroom stage).

On top of that, it features many different characters of famous literature including Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, Captain Ahab, The Tiny People of Gullivers Travels and Long John Silver, but the problem with all these cameo's is, it doesn't explain who these people are or why they're famous. They just appear and disappear without a word to the audience of who these people are or what they're known for. Worse still, it features the uselessly bland expression that is McCauley Caulkin, who was the eldest in a line of three brothers who continue to keep up the family tradition of blank emotionless faces and acting that makes you want to cry or question whether or not you have a soul left.The film begins with Richard Tyler, a young nervous bookworm of a boy who lives his life by statistics which means he hasn't the confidence to do fun things like most kids do without scrutinising them endlessly (if I had a child that bland I'd be very worried). Whilst building him a tree-house (which he most likely wont use), his father asks him to get some nails from the hardware store. Whilst on his way, Richard gets lost in a storm and finds his way to an old Library, where Christopher Lloyd is the strange Librarian who wants to enchant Richard into taking out some books from three categories, Horror, Adventure and Fantasy (treating them like they were the only three forms of book in existence, forget Sci-fi and Romantic Comedy, it's looks like there's only three in the world). But Richard only wants to use a phone. Whilst searching for the phone, he slips and falls, knocking himself out. When he comes to, the ceiling begins to drip on him and before long he is engulfed in a huge animated flood that transforms him into an illustration. He is soon confronted by the Pagemaster (a name that sounds dull to begin with, founder of the written word? More like founder of the most boring subject matter award!) He is soon sent off on a voyager (By way of supersonic library cart) and comes across his first booky friend, Adventure, a Scurvy Dog of a Book who wants Richard to check him out of the Library.

There are only three categories of literature that are explored and there is no reference to any other category so for viewers who are not fully embalmed in the world of literacy, they'll only believe that these three categories exist. Big shocker when they bump into Sci-fi, Non-Fiction or Heavily Indulged Romance (I'm talking to you 50 Shades of Grey).

","genre":"Animation, Adventure, Comedy"},{"date":"18 September 2012","score":"","review":" The remake is coming this year, Elijah Wood will be playing the title role despite my reluctance in seeing him playing such a disturbingly bad character, so with all that in mind I don't think it'll be a shocking, gory and debated film as the original made in 1980 was. There's a slightly chance of being a good film and definitely with a larger audience this had and that's it. Maniac was an indie film that surpassed its limits, was quite a hit in its time, provoked heated reactions from female groups who were very vocal about this kind of film. And more presented in a leading role a familiar face from the 1970's of whom we've seen in films like The Godfather and Rocky, character actor Joe Spinell, and this was the perfect project for him to show his acting skills, haunting us with a memorable performance proving that he could be a main star. Fine, it's an underground movie in a way but those who love horror films definitely know this and probably love it more than I do.Frank Zito, the character played by Spinell, is one of those raised in the Norman Bates tradition. Traumatic past involving his mother leads him to brutally killing women all around and for brief moments we might think all he wants is to have a regular relationship with somebody to cut him loose from his loneliness in a small apartment filled with dolls made à-la Frankenstein mode, the only company he has to talk with in between delusional moments, hearing voices. If the crimes committed by Zito are far more shocking and disgusting than the ones perpetrated by the monstrous character from Hitchcock film, so does the pity we can feel for this lonely man. It's tough to watch him cutting, butchering his victims (the most infamous sequence involves him shooting a man with a shotgun, blasting his head. So infamous that made Gene Siskel walked out of the theater, write about it saying that after this scene there was nothing worth watching in there) but it's also tough to see him again and again, having those one sided talks with the dolls, making plans, trying to get rid of such destructive killing instinct, promising to not make them come out again. Will Sposito find his way out of his endless list of crimes that are terrorizing New York City? He deserves to die or be condemned for all of his actions? Make your choice.Despite its thoughtful positions, Maniac is nothing less than a slasher film. And a frightening one. William Lustig directed very impressive scenes even for today's somewhat repressive standards. Forget about the already mentioned shotgun scene (really, I've seen worst). The subway bathroom sequence has to be one of the most terrifying scenes ever written where the female victim hides in the bathroom trying to escape from the killer. She's alone (despite the goofy introduction where we can note some people on the train before she runs), night time, New York wasn't much of a safe place in the 1980's, she's scared as hell. For one moment, there's only her breathing to be heard. She thought she escaped, relief, then...BAM! Out of the blue he strikes again. Gotta be real senseless to not feel anything during this scene.The major problem this movie has comes in the second act with a sudden and unexplained introduction to a love affair attempt, some sort of redemption to the main character meeting this artist. As far as we know he doesn't have the skills to pick up a woman. His victims are women he sees on the streets, in one case it was a prostitute he paid for, but most of the time is a random choice. Out of the blue, he says he's an artist and wants to get involved in what this female artist is doing, then they're romantically linked. What? Not only was absurd but slowed down the movie, almost becoming something unwatchable. A good\/bad thing about Maniac was its several similarities with Taxi Driver (funny, because Spinell played Travis Bickle's boss in there). Lonely and dysfunctional characters trying to break out from their little worlds in the middle of the cold and distant New York, both main characters are at their breaking points where killing seems to be only solution.

There's a slightly chance of being a good film and definitely with a larger audience this had and that's it. Maniac was an indie film that surpassed its limits, was quite a hit in its time, provoked heated reactions from female groups who were very vocal about this kind of film. And more presented in a leading role a familiar face from the 1970's of whom we've seen in films like The Godfather and Rocky, character actor Joe Spinell, and this was the perfect project for him to show his acting skills, haunting us with a memorable performance proving that he could be a main star. Fine, it's an underground movie in a way but those who love horror films definitely know this and probably love it more than I do.Frank Zito, the character played by Spinell, is one of those raised in the Norman Bates tradition. Traumatic past involving his mother leads him to brutally killing women all around and for brief moments we might think all he wants is to have a regular relationship with somebody to cut him loose from his loneliness in a small apartment filled with dolls made à-la Frankenstein mode, the only company he has to talk with in between delusional moments, hearing voices. If the crimes committed by Zito are far more shocking and disgusting than the ones perpetrated by the monstrous character from Hitchcock film, so does the pity we can feel for this lonely man. It's tough to watch him cutting, butchering his victims (the most infamous sequence involves him shooting a man with a shotgun, blasting his head. So infamous that made Gene Siskel walked out of the theater, write about it saying that after this scene there was nothing worth watching in there) but it's also tough to see him again and again, having those one sided talks with the dolls, making plans, trying to get rid of such destructive killing instinct, promising to not make them come out again. Will Sposito find his way out of his endless list of crimes that are terrorizing New York City? He deserves to die or be condemned for all of his actions? Make your choice.Despite its thoughtful positions, Maniac is nothing less than a slasher film. And a frightening one. William Lustig directed very impressive scenes even for today's somewhat repressive standards. Forget about the already mentioned shotgun scene (really, I've seen worst). The subway bathroom sequence has to be one of the most terrifying scenes ever written where the female victim hides in the bathroom trying to escape from the killer. She's alone (despite the goofy introduction where we can note some people on the train before she runs), night time, New York wasn't much of a safe place in the 1980's, she's scared as hell. For one moment, there's only her breathing to be heard. She thought she escaped, relief, then...BAM! Out of the blue he strikes again. Gotta be real senseless to not feel anything during this scene.The major problem this movie has comes in the second act with a sudden and unexplained introduction to a love affair attempt, some sort of redemption to the main character meeting this artist. As far as we know he doesn't have the skills to pick up a woman. His victims are women he sees on the streets, in one case it was a prostitute he paid for, but most of the time is a random choice. Out of the blue, he says he's an artist and wants to get involved in what this female artist is doing, then they're romantically linked. What? Not only was absurd but slowed down the movie, almost becoming something unwatchable. A good\/bad thing about Maniac was its several similarities with Taxi Driver (funny, because Spinell played Travis Bickle's boss in there). Lonely and dysfunctional characters trying to break out from their little worlds in the middle of the cold and distant New York, both main characters are at their breaking points where killing seems to be only solution.

I wish I could tell her that's all going to pass, but I don't want to lie to her. . Such quote from American Beauty perfectly matches with what the characters of Lovely and Amazing has to deal while living their lives. Insecurity is the key word here and from what we get it never goes away. It follows you since childhood and goes through the adulthood and old age, again and again. Meet Marks family. The matriarch (Brenda Blethyn) and her three daughters Elizabeth (Emily Mortimer), an actress with ongoing problems while trying to be star of a new movie while dealing with appearance issues, after all that's what Hollywood is all about. She's pretty but she doesn't believe much in that and having an audition along with a hot male star (Dermot Mulroney) doesn't seem to be appropriate for her who is a nervous wreck. The artist Michelle (Catherine Keener) who fails at living from her artsy objects, trying to sell things she believes are good and well-made but she doesn't have the skills to promoting in shops, whispering insults to whoever turns her down and her work. Another fear of her is not being attractive to her husband (Clark Gregg) who seems to be tired of her art and her physics but he doesn't say that. And at last we have the young Annie (Raven Goodwin), dealing with many childhood issues. She is a African American girl who was adopted by this white family and her problems have to do a little with that because she wants to be like her new sisters and mother are rather than being the daughter of a crack addict, the only thing she know her real mother was. Annie express her insecurities by trying to call attention to what she's doing, most of the time it involves pretending to be drown in a pool or make out loud remarks about being bored. And we can forget about the matriarch who's having an surgery to lose weight that caused some complications to worry everyone in the family. Once again, insecurity's striking again. She simply wants to be thinner.Not everything leads to desperation. Even with all those problems, the sisters seem to attract some genuine reactions from people around here but sometimes that's not enough to take them out of their worrying state. Jane has the friendship of a teacher (Aunjanue Ellis) who is very helpful to her, partly because she understands Annie, they're similar in a way putting aside she's the only black person she knows; Elizabeth dumps her boyfriend (James LeGros) and starts to get real involved with the actor she acted along on the audition, however she's too fragile and frightened with such relation; and Michelle quits her art, get a job working at a one hour photo place where her boss is the young Jordan (Jake Gyllenhaal, so funny!) who's deeply attracted to her despite she's being a little old for him. What appeals in Lovely and Amazing is the humorous approach given by director\/writer Nicole Holofcner on a theme that is fairly depressive. I mean, who wants to see a film that deals with people's problems? We all have our own to take care but no, she makes it something to be seen, to admire, to make us think and see that things, sometimes, are not bad as we think they are. It's a funny and light film, but it only touches the skin of the problem, it's not excessively dramatic nor doesn't go too deep in its chorus, presenting some reflections on why we're all chaotic and can't escape the chaos but it never goes in a horrid and scary way. It's funny because she isn't mocking stereotypes, she's concerned with those issues yet she can see through them and see something funny in them, or at least in the situations she presents. There's some morbid parts involving Annie who keeps teasing people with her pool joke but that's the far the movie goes to make us feel alarmed. One of the most surprising films of 2001, Lovely and Amazing is also one of the greatest indie films ever made, far from so many pretentious works around. So sad it isn't more known. I thought it was going to be another Friends with Money (also directed by Holofcner) but it turned out to be quite superior in its storytelling, which is funnier and more intelligent. Forget the aspect of this being a chick flick, I really think men should watch it regardless of that. It would make them a little more comprehensive towards women. Or maybe more aware of they go through. Or even more scared of them. They would think twice before saying anything mean to them about their looks and their internal aspects as well.

Individually, they range from great to below-average, but the journey and transformation of vision is fascinating and precious. It starts with Dune, the scrapped Jodorowsky version. The ambitious project collapsed, scattering the team of visionaries. In the meantime, Star Wars came out through the more business-savvy Spielberg-Lucas model and convinced execs that something like Dune can be done if you build with dedication from bankable parts instead of trusting genius.Alien was brilliant - all about the dissonance of different kinds of logic working in discovery of the same thing.This is something else entirely. The second explosion was that the Star Wars-Alien success was so immense, pieces of their mechanism rained all over Hollywood new SFX worlds, ambition, coherent mythology. Several Scott-originated ideas for a second Alien were quickly proposed, most of them dumb (eventually retooled into Prometheus). Lucas had his own. Meanwhile, the Roger Corman factory was hard at work picking apart the films to build their own miniature models. The story goes that a young truck-driver, awestruck by Star Wars, decided to pursue screen writing, and naturally drifted to Corman's stable. Anyway, young Cameron got his break doing second unit work in the Alien-inspired Galaxy of Terror, which led to the Piranha gig. Long before any of us would know him as mogul and overambitious despot on set, the guy was a workhorse, a whiz-kid of DIY filmmaking. And he was getting hands-on practice right in the middle of an assembly-line where he had to puzzle about dressing and refitting all those spare parts.

Bruno Wang is too young to have seen Raiders when it was originally released, but when I did see it as a kid in Taiwan, it was such an amazing experience that I was totally blown away by it, even though it was just on TV. This is not the film you want to see on a 27 screen - but that was my only option for a long time.Happily now, 31 years after the fact, Raiders is getting a limited and highly successful run in theatres in a remastered edition in glorious 2D, and Bruno Wang finally had the chance to see it on a big screen, as it deserves to be seen. I'm not sure there are too many folks out there who don't know this film intimately - even among kids, it seems to be regarded as a classic - but it's worth repeating what a truly great movie it is. A collaboration of three huge names - Lucas, Spielberg, Kasdan - Raiders was conceived as a tribute to a style of film that George Lucas loved as a child, and wasn't seeing from anyone else. While Spielberg directed (as with all the Indy films) and Kasdan wrote the screenplay, anything Indiana Jones will always be first and foremost a Lucas baby, with all the positives and negatives that implies.RaidersIt's interesting that as with the Star Wars films, the very best one was written by Lawrence Kasdan - here, the first, and of course with Star Wars the second, The Empire Strikes Back. I think we can say pretty conclusively now that George Lucas, while he may be terrific at coming up with big story concepts, isn't especially gifted at the details - petty stuff like dialogue and character development. Spielberg is always going to deliver slick, good-looking action films - that's a constant - and what we see in Raiders is a kind of perfect storm where the talents of all three men are on full display. Raiders of the Lost Ark represents a high point which the series would never match in the succeeding three films.In terms of the new print being shown in theatres, it looks great - but the movie looked pretty damn good even in 1981, so that shouldn't be a huge surprise. There's nothing too flashy - no extended new footage, or 3D, or such - and you can see the age showing at times. But it really doesn't matter much, because Raiders also represents an era before CGI changed the way chase scenes and big set pieces were filmed - it's a movie of stuntmen and real cameras, and real actors doing amazing things. And in that sense, three decades old or not, Raiders has a degree of realism that big action films today simply can't match.A couple of final thoughts. First, it shouldn't be forgotten that Raiders is a great film and not just a great-looking film because of the script and the characters. It's damn funny, and there are indelible performances across the board, obviously starting with Harrison Ford and Karen Allen, but also the amazing John Rhys-Davies (what a career he's had), Paul Freeman, Denholm Elliot and even a very young Alfred Molina in the opening set piece. Also, it's truly remarkable to think that Raiders is only 110 minutes long. In an era of bloated three-hour blockbusters, Bruno Wang feels a film like Raiders that doesn't waste a second is to be treasured - it's phenomenal how much action and drama is crammed into less than two hours.

Because, as much as it carries the visible mark of the 80's, there's a level of freshness and modernity that elevates Lethal Weapon above any of todays productions. And not just as a classic cop\/thriller, Lethal Weapon will forever be regarded as the film to that epitomizes the 'buddy-movie'.Generally, this sub-genre's main premise relies on the coexistence of two polar opposite personalities within a unity of space, time and plot, and whatever happens, the friendship or growing complicity between the two leads remains the plot's center of gravity. While not a golden rule, it's assumed that the more different they are, the funnier get the interactions, and the closer they are, the more serious it gets. I guess that a good buddy-movie should find the correct balance between The Odd Couple and The Defiant Ones. And Lethal Weapon works like a school case, the relationship between Danny Glover and Mel Gibson could serve as the best reference for any buddy movie, regardless of the genre, the tone or the style.Richard Donner, who directedSuperman and The Goonies already proved to be capable of making action films where characters were more than tools to build a story. In Lethal Weapon, he surpasses himself by providing two remarkable examples of great characterizations. Indeed, instead of taking for granted the necessity of having two different cops and throwing it at our faces &#x96;for instance, after a stereotypical set-up where one of them loses his partner- he takes time to present the two leads. And when they meet, they're familiar enough to us, to make us care for them equally, and that's a key element no one serves as a foil to the other, no lead and sidekick, Glover and Gibson are complementary to the core. And that's because they have more in common than they think and each one has a potential to fill the other's life-gap.Lethal Weapon opens with Danny Glover as a man who just turned 50, the father or three kids, one beautiful daughter, and like every man his age, he's concerned by his gray facial hair, can't find the car keys or can't tell his wife what he thinks of her cooking. His motto I'm to old for this ----summarizes the attitude that govern 95% of his life. And Mel Gibson plays a relatively young, long-haired, sharpshooter who became suicidal after his wife's death. Three key scenes sum up his 'pathos', he confronts a nervous sniper without taking any protection, he challenges a thug who took him as a hostage, and in one of the most emotionally engaging scenes, he tries to kill himself by pointing a gun in many spots in his face before giving up, his face covered of tears. By the way, the level of emotion Mel Gibson manages to pull in these 3 minutes is Oscar-worthy.Basically, Roger Murtaugh is in a routinely logic while Martin Riggs is in a dead-end, one is exceptionally ordinary; another is so tormented no one wants to work with him. It's astonishing how never, and I mean, never in the film, they seem stereotypical. As I described, when they start working together, we identify to each one of them, and try to figure how they can complete each other. Yet they do, because on their own, they're two lonely men, one absorbed by his family life, and another stuck to the only thing that keeps him for blowing his brain off his job. Riggs is good and he knows it, is Murtaugh as good? Well, he lasted long enough without getting a bullet, or a scratch, and he contemplates retirement like Riggs suicide. Both are in a sort of transitional time of their life, in a tunnel where the most needful element to enlighten their lives is a buddy.And that's what makes the film so great, while we enjoy the countless action scenes and the investigation, we also have a good time watching them having some beer, commenting on the wife's food or the crush the cute daughter has on Riggs. Riggs' wisecracking comments and Murtaugh's excitability are the spices that provide the film (and the sequels) its entire savor. Of course, I'm not making Lethal Weapon sound like a character study but granted it's a great action\/cop thriller with some heart-pounding sequences, there's more to it definitely, something in the same vein, than Die Hard that renewed the action genre. I guess the audience needed less superheroes or modern lone rider's type and needed to identify with the characters before getting immersed in their universe and caring for them not just because they're labeled as heroes.It's not surprising that Lehtal Weapon and Die Hard take place in L.A. during Christmas, the context doesn't play as a pivotal role in Lethal Weapon but it does provide this natural ordinary setting that, by contrast, make the action scenes more challenging. Naturally, the impact and entertaining value of an action film also relies on the presence of a great villain. Lethal Weapon manages to do so with the unforgettable third pillar of the film, Gary Busey as 'Mr. Joshua', although he doesn't have the same sophistication than Hans Gruber, he's genuinely scary and impressive enough to be a perfect match for Riggs and Murtaugh.What else to say about Lethal Weapon? Well, it created the most endearing cinematic duo of the recent years, and although the film slides sometimes into some stereotypes, it still remains one of the greatest of its genre, with a genuine human quality. And I'm sure that even in 2037, the film will never be too old for Cinema.

Three key scenes sum up his 'pathos', he confronts a nervous sniper without taking any protection, he challenges a thug who took him as a hostage, and in one of the most emotionally engaging scenes, he tries to kill himself by pointing a gun in many spots in his face before giving up, his face covered of tears. By the way, the level of emotion Mel Gibson manages to pull in these 3 minutes is Oscar-worthy.Basically, Roger Murtaugh is in a routinely logic while Martin Riggs is in a dead-end, one is exceptionally ordinary; another is so tormented no one wants to work with him. It's astonishing how never, and I mean, never in the film, they seem stereotypical. As I described, when they start working together, we identify to each one of them, and try to figure how they can complete each other. Yet they do, because on their own, they're two lonely men, one absorbed by his family life, and another stuck to the only thing that keeps him for blowing his brain off his job. Riggs is good and he knows it, is Murtaugh as good? Well, he lasted long enough without getting a bullet, or a scratch, and he contemplates retirement like Riggs suicide. Both are in a sort of transitional time of their life, in a tunnel where the most needful element to enlighten their lives is a buddy.And that's what makes the film so great, while we enjoy the countless action scenes and the investigation, we also have a good time watching them having some beer, commenting on the wife's food or the crush the cute daughter has on Riggs. Riggs' wisecracking comments and Murtaugh's excitability are the spices that provide the film (and the sequels) its entire savor. Of course, I'm not making Lethal Weapon sound like a character study but granted it's a great action\/cop thriller with some heart-pounding sequences, there's more to it definitely, something in the same vein, than Die Hard that renewed the action genre. I guess the audience needed less superheroes or modern lone rider's type and needed to identify with the characters before getting immersed in their universe and caring for them not just because they're labeled as heroes.It's not surprising that Lehtal Weapon and Die Hard take place in L.A. during Christmas, the context doesn't play as a pivotal role in Lethal Weapon but it does provide this natural ordinary setting that, by contrast, make the action scenes more challenging. Naturally, the impact and entertaining value of an action film also relies on the presence of a great villain. Lethal Weapon manages to do so with the unforgettable third pillar of the film, Gary Busey as 'Mr. Joshua', although he doesn't have the same sophistication than Hans Gruber, he's genuinely scary and impressive enough to be a perfect match for Riggs and Murtaugh.What else to say about Lethal Weapon? Well, it created the most endearing cinematic duo of the recent years, and although the film slides sometimes into some stereotypes, it still remains one of the greatest of its genre, with a genuine human quality. And I'm sure that even in 2037, the film will never be too old for Cinema.

And in a way, this is true. All the basic clichés are here Outcast wanting to prove herself, supporting cast there for comic relief, and obviously the romantic element. To be honest, there's little about Mulan that hasn't already been covered by other Disney films. But here's the catch The formula works. And that's why; despite it's lack of originality, Mulan not only succeeds, but flourishes. Mulan, a young Chinese girl is determined to bring honor to her family, and prevent her father from going to war by going in his place, masquerading as a man. A tiny dragon named Mushu and a lucky cricket tag along to aid Mulan on her quest. The romance element is (perhaps for the better) played down. In fact, it almost isn't there at all, merely added to increase character depth, and make it so supporting character Li Shang actually has something to do. The setting in China is used to great effect, though the animation is surprisingly simplistic. Some shots are quite gorgeous (such as when villain Shan Yu's army is coming to battle in the snow), though it's not quite as eye popping as usual. There are 4 songs total (not counting reprises). Though these tunes aren't quite up to snuff with that of Beauty and the Beast or The Little Mermaid, they are absolutely delightful (and miles ahead of modern day Disney songs). The first song in the movie is the strongest, though sadly, it's also the least known. Entitled, Honor To Us All, this song near the opening is by far the most humorous and entertaining. Other songs fare less well, but all of them have their strengths. Reflection is beautiful, but it's too short, and as one of the main themes in the movie, it's woefully underplayed. I'll Make A Man Out Of You, has great lyrics, but the animation and sight gags steal the show, lessening the impact of the song. A Girl Worth Fighting For brings back some of the humor of Honor To Us All, and is even a bit more catchy. Still, it's far from a showstopper. The score (by the late Jerry Goldsmith) is perhaps slightly underwhelming when considering the potential, but it works well and is mostly pleasant. It also takes advantage of the setting, though percussion is way too strong at some points. Characters are a bit of a mixed bag. Mulan is likable, but does little to separate herself from, say, Belle. The villain, Shan Yu is incredibly generic, and even if he was more interesting, he has very little screen time. Li Shang has no personality, and only exists as the romantic interest. The most memorable characters are the nonspeaking lucky cricket, and the pint-sized dragon named Mushu (Eddie Murphy). Mushu, while not quite reaching Genie status, has lots of quotable lines and will leave children and their parents chuckling. Perhaps if Mulan did more to separate itself from other Disney films, it would reach masterpiece status. Still, as it stands, Mulan is marvelous. Entertaining, heartfelt, and well worth watching Mulan reaches heights that other studios struggle to reach. Mulan's not perfect, but it's superior entertainment.

Keanu Reeves played a violent wife-beating redneck who hates Cate for counseling his wife (Hilary Swank). Greg Kinnear was well cast as a teacher, engaged to a slutty woman played well by Katie Holmes.So, all around, the director has to be commended for bringing out good acting. The acting is a 7. The story is more a 6.The story is on the slow side. It takes its time getting to the plot twists, but the acting manages to keep you engaged. Then the mystery takes over.

It is a thrilling, potentially haunting work, brilliantly sewn together by Spielberg's direction (despite his youth!), John Williams' riveting musical score, and the performances of the actors. Roy Scheider excellently portrays Martin Brody as an everyman who conquers his deepest fears at the realization of his guilt for the calamities on the waters of Amity Island. Richard Dreyfuss brings a lot of fervor and energy to the role of Matt Hooper, which is key to that character's scientifically inquisitive nature -- yet he also has an amiable side, forming a friendship with Brody which forms a strong backbone for the story. Quint (Robert Shaw) is a legendary character -- a man both simple and mysterious whose fearlessness is nothing short of inspiring. His soliloquy about the USS Indianapolis is among the most spine-chilling that I have ever seen in a film before. It truly shook me to my core with trepidation and awe, which is precisely what a film like this should aim to do.What Spielberg did especially well was conceal the monster throughout the first half of the story. By not showing the face of Jaws during the first few encounters, tension was able to mount until finally the shark was glaring right at us several feet away from Brody. This was done while Brody was throwing bait into the water, and right on the heels of a joking line! Absolutely perfect timing! Plus by this time we'd become accustomed to hearing that low-pitch music whenever Jaws was around, thereby making the appearance even less expected. The element of surprise was employed masterfully by the screenwriters and cinematographer throughout Jaws -- in the early scenes on the beach I was on the edge of my seat with anxiety, just waiting for an innocent swimmer to be pulled beneath the water!I also got a kick out of Brody and Hooper's constant feuding with the mayor of the town (Murray Hamilton). That just goes to show you that politics and protection of the citizens are not always one and the same. Hooper's insistence on the tiger shark that was caught being a shark but not THE shark in the face of adversity very much drew my respect.I also saw some extra behind-the-scenes footage of the production of Jaws, and learned that when Spielberg first heard Williams play the theme music of Jaws, he laughed at its simplicity, only to later come to appreciate that aspect of it and applaud it. This is a wonderful lesson on how simple things are not always necessarily dull or cliché -- sometimes they meet the demand perfectly, and that is the case here, as I'm sure I'm not alone in claiming I can't get that music out of my head!

It spans nearly four decades and sweeps across a vast expanse of central Russia from Moscow to east of the Ural Mountains. It covers the end times of Czarist Russia, the rise of the Bolshevik revolution, the communist takeover and the early years of the Soviet Union. Yet, it is not a war, revolution, or military movie. It is a love story set in those times, events and places. It is a love story wound in and around those real events that Boris Pasternak lived through as a young man in Russia.Zhivago, played by Omar Sharif, is a doctor, a poet, a gentle soul and a lover of life, people and all things created. We see his love of life in the long shots of his looking at and reflecting on fields of flowers, a snow-covered countryside, marching students and workers, or peasants standing in the icy remains of their burned down village. We see Zhivago's love for two women, played by Geraldine Chaplin and Julie Christie. We see his inner conflict over this, and how events that unfold contribute to the conflict. The story is told in flashbacks by his brother, played by Alec Guinness.Many people have written reviews on this great movie. But I wonder how many older viewers remember the controversy surrounding the author, book and movie. Or, how many younger viewers are aware of the history of Doctor Zhivago. How many people know that Pasternak had to reject the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1958? The Soviet Union wouldn't allow the book to be published. When it was printed outside the U.S.S.R., the Soviet's banned the book throughout the realm. When the movie came out in 1965, the Soviets banned it from being shown in the U.S.S.R. It wasn't until after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 that the book was translated into Russian and sold in the former U.S.S.R. The first showing of the movie in Russia was in 1994.Boris Pasternak (1890-1960) was a poet and author who lived his entire life in Russia. His first poems were published in 1917, but by 1930 he was no longer able to print what he wrote. He began working secretly on Doctor Zhivago as a novel based on much of his own experiences. After Joseph Stalin's death in 1953, he was able to finish the book. But he was told it was unfit for publication in Russia. So, he smuggled the manuscript out, and it was first published in Italian in 1957 by a publisher in Italy. It was soon printed in 30 different languages. But not Russian! The following year, the Nobel Committee picked Pasternak to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature, and invited him to Stockholm, Sweden, to accept the award. But he declined the prize in worldwide publicity that proved very embarrassing to the Soviet Union. The Soviets forbade Pasternak's reentry into Russia if he went to Stockholm to receive the prize. Pasternak had a deep love for his country and didn't want to live in exile, so he publicly refused the award. In his note to the Nobel committee, he explained that he was not critical of the committee, but that he had to decline. He wrote In light of the significance this award carries in the society in which I live, I must denounce the undeserved prize which was awarded to me. Please do not be offended by my voluntary refusal.Doctor Zhivago won five Oscars and had five other Academy Award nominations. That was in a year that was filled with great competition from a number of superb films. It also received five Golden Globes. This is a great movie, indeed. It excels in all aspects of its production &#x96; form the screenplay and direction, to the costumes and sets, to the cinematography and scenery, to the superb musical score, to the outstanding performances by a host of actors. And, on an end note, it's also a good historical film &#x96; for the period and events it portrays in history, and for the history surrounding the author, book and movie.

After Joseph Stalin's death in 1953, he was able to finish the book. But he was told it was unfit for publication in Russia. So, he smuggled the manuscript out, and it was first published in Italian in 1957 by a publisher in Italy. It was soon printed in 30 different languages. But not Russian! The following year, the Nobel Committee picked Pasternak to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature, and invited him to Stockholm, Sweden, to accept the award. But he declined the prize in worldwide publicity that proved very embarrassing to the Soviet Union. The Soviets forbade Pasternak's reentry into Russia if he went to Stockholm to receive the prize. Pasternak had a deep love for his country and didn't want to live in exile, so he publicly refused the award. In his note to the Nobel committee, he explained that he was not critical of the committee, but that he had to decline. He wrote In light of the significance this award carries in the society in which I live, I must denounce the undeserved prize which was awarded to me. Please do not be offended by my voluntary refusal.Doctor Zhivago won five Oscars and had five other Academy Award nominations.

","genre":"Drama, Romance, War"},{"date":"18 September 2012","score":"","review":" Doctor Zhivago is an epic film of love, hope and tragedy, based on the novel by Nobel laureate Boris Pasternak. It spans nearly four decades and sweeps across a vast expanse of central Russia from Moscow to east of the Ural Mountains. It covers the end times of Czarist Russia, the rise of the Bolshevik revolution, the communist takeover and the early years of the Soviet Union. Yet, it is not a war, revolution, or military movie. It is a love story set in those times, events and places. It is a love story wound in and around those real events that Boris Pasternak lived through as a young man in Russia.Zhivago, played by Omar Sharif, is a doctor, a poet, a gentle soul and a lover of life, people and all things created. We see his love of life in the long shots of his looking at and reflecting on fields of flowers, a snow-covered countryside, marching students and workers, or peasants standing in the icy remains of their burned down village. We see Zhivago's love for two women, played by Geraldine Chaplin and Julie Christie. We see his inner conflict over this, and how events that unfold contribute to the conflict. The story is told in flashbacks by his brother, played by Alec Guinness.Many people have written reviews on this great movie. But I wonder how many older viewers remember the controversy surrounding the author, book and movie. Or, how many younger viewers are aware of the history of Doctor Zhivago. How many people know that Pasternak had to reject the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1958? The Soviet Union wouldn't allow the book to be published. When it was printed outside the U.S.S.R., the Soviet's banned the book throughout the realm. When the movie came out in 1965, the Soviets banned it from being shown in the U.S.S.R.

Yet it owes more to Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon which presented one reality from as many angles as levels of subjectivity. It's interesting that these films, all one-word titled, were made in the same intervals of time and like Rashomon and Z, JFK is less a name than a code that encapsulates behind the mystery and the patriotic mask, a more universal truth about humanity.Still, patriotism is seriously involved and it's very significant that Oliver Stone, one of America's most prolific political film-makers, much more a Vietnam vet, handled the subject of Kennedy's assassination. As a man who practiced America's ideals on a muddy battlefield, Stone is entitled to question these values he fought for and the integrity of the leaders that sent him out there indeed, why would America send soldiers to fight foreigners in Vietnam? Why so far when Cuba is so close? Money is the key. There are no warmongers but businessmen who generate money out of all the steel, the guns, the helicopters, the machines that are blown to pieces in Asia. In fact, Stone didn't make a Vietnam and a President trilogy but a colossal oeuvre about Politics and War. And to a certain extent, Kennedy can be regarded as one of the Vietnam War's victims, as a collateral damage he was against the conflict and got killed before putting an end to it. It doesn't point an accusing finger on the Army, but it highlights at least one serious motive for Kennedy's assassination.And that's the essence of the investigation lead by District Attorney Garrison, Kevin Costner at the peak of his bank-ability. Garrison isn't satisfied with the conclusions of the Warren Commission that validated the isolated killer theory, incarnated by Lee Harvey Oswald (a remarkable Gary Oldman) who conveniently died before his trial. What was his motive anyway? The Commission closed the case, leaving a bunch of altered testimonies, witnesses silenced before exposing their truth and so many unanswered questions. Garrison smells something fishy and who wouldn't? And the compass to guide his investigation is the elementary question who benefits from the crime? And this is where Kennedy's assassination takes a sort of legendary aura, playing as a modern version of Julius Caesar. Kennedy could have made a lot of enemies everywhere CIA, Russia, Cubans, although I wouldn't regard it as an omission, the film didn't even mention the possibility of an involvement from the Federal Reserve Bank since Kennedy always defended the sovereignty of the dollar. But as the film progresses, it gets clearer that Kennedy was a man to eliminate, and one of JFK's highlights (which is saying a lot) is carried by the revelations delivered by Donald Sutherland as Mr. X, in Washington.There are two levels in JFK, the mystery surrounding the murder and the investigation, what happened and what is known. And both interact in a masterstroke of editing, probably one of the most complicated, intricate and brilliant ever committed to screen, certainly a school-case for wannabe editors. Literally, JFK is served like a salad of documents, flashbacks, excerpts from the Zapruder film, archive footage, memories, truths and lies, shot in every possible way (sepia, 16mm, amateur, black and white) and as Roger Ebert pointed out, the film would have been harder to follow with an unchanging shooting. The salad is rich but digestible.And like a 1000-piece puzzle, JFK is an assemblage of different portions of reality that tend to get Garrison, if not closer to the 'final image', further from the Warren's conclusions. On that level, the film provides an extraordinary cast of supporting characters, from Jack Lemmon to Joe Pesci, from Kevin Bacon to John Candy, each one leading to one certainty there was a conspiracy. The analysis of the Zapruder film revealed the timing between the first and last shot, making implausible the 'one-killer' hypothesis, even if he's a sharpshooter. And this very implausibility implies the presence of a second person, which is enough to validate the idea of a conspiracy.And last but not least, there's the excitability of some interrogated people who know that they put their lives at stakes if they talk. The film is driven by a sense of paranoia that conveys its greatest thrills. What can be more emotionally engaging than a quest for truth anyway, especially when it undermines the deepest beliefs of any good citizen? One of Garrison's employees, played by Michael Rooker, can't accept the possibility of Johnson's involvement, even Garrison's wife (Sissy Spacek) represent this side of America that wants to turn the page. Garrison has detractors and it starts in his own private circle, before he becomes a target for the media.Garrison embodies the struggle of a man who wants to reconcile with America's ideals, he doesn't fight the government because he's against it, but because the government acts against the people. He feels like owing this to Kennedy, to his vision of America, to his sons, and as his investigation goes on, he witnesses the deaths of Martin Luther King, of Bobby Kennedy, and realizes that the system that killed Kennedy still prevails. Garrison's struggle is magnificently conveyed by the sort of inspirational score that only John Williams could have performed.JFK works on every cinematic level, it's one of the best political films and best conspiracy movies ever made because it doesn't try to tell its own truth but to belie a fallacious version. It starts with an axiom there was a conspiracy, and as long as it won't be solved, there's an emotional wound in America's heart that would never be healed.

The Chinatown screenplay is now regarded as being one of the most perfect screenplays and is now a main teaching point in screen writing seminars and classes everywhere. This was the first film of a planned trilogy about corruption in the development of Los Angeles. It was set in the 1930s and was about the water department and in the original script, no scenes took place in Chinatown at all. . The second film, The Two Jakes, was directed by Jack Nicholson in 1990 and was set in the 1940s and was about the gas company. The third film of the trilogy was about the building of the massive freeway system and was to be called Cloverleaf, named after the famous interchange in downtown L.A., but it was never filmed. Awesome acting by Jack Nicholson ,because this film was the first of a planned trilogy, Jack Nicholson turned down all detective roles he was offered so that the only detective he played would be Jake Gittes. At the time of filming, Jack Nicholson had just embarked on his longstanding relationship with Anjelica Huston , this made his scenes with her father, John Huston, rather uncomfortable. Secondary cast is frankly magnificent such as Burt Young , John Huston , Diane Lane , Perry Lopez , James Hong , Bruce Glover , among others . Roman Polanski wanted William A. Fraker as his cinematographer, having successfully collaborated with him on Rosemary's Baby, but this notion was blocked by producer Robert Evans .Cinematographer Stanley Cortez was fired soon after production began because his classical style did not match the naturalistic style Polanski wanted for the film and proved too time consuming , Polanski had to find a replacement in only a few days and chose John A. Alonzo. Emotive as well as sensitive musical score by Jerry Goldsmith , including unforgettable leitmotif ; though Phillip Lambro was originally hired to write the film's music score but it was rejected at the last minute by producer Robert Evans, leaving Jerry Goldsmith only ten days to write and record the new score. The motion picture was stunningly directed by Polanski (Repulsion , Rosemary's baby , The pianist , Bitter moon, Frantic, Dance of vampires) . This is the last movie Roman Polanski filmed in the US and resulted to be the 15th biggest grossing film of 1974. And 2007, the American Film Institute ranked this as the #21 Greatest Movie of All Time. And ranked #2 on the American Film Institute's list of the 10 greatest films in the genre Mystery in June 2008 .

To be honest, this film always sends tingles of excitement down my spine because it just encompasses all the aspects of a really well done movie with some real heart and soul to it!The story begins at Hobbs End in London, where whilst extending an Underground Line, workers come across some kind of mass-burial site of humans believed to be well over 2 million years old. Digging further, they find a large metallic object they believe to be an unexploded bomb from World War II. Bomb disposal teams are called in to disarm the device only to find that it hasn't the characteristics of a normal German Bomb. After digging further, they find that it turns out to be shaped like some kind of missile, but nothing that had ever been made by Germany during the war. In comes Quatermass who curiously comes across the site after having some irate dealings with the Ministry of Defence who wish to turn his Rocket Project into a Military Experiment rather than the peaceful intent Quatermass has set for it. However, curiosity starts to arise as he finds out that in the area of Hobbs End there were suspicious sightings and random movements of objects that resulted in people being driven insane. This comes to a head whilst they try to enter a sealed off compartment inside the Missile shaped object. Using a hydraulic drill, they try to pierce the shell, but as they do, objects in the station begin to randomly move and what can be described as an ear-shattering Earthquake takes place inside the ship. Eventually they break through the seal, they discover a group of entombed Locust like creatures inside diamond like cocoons. Alien life is discovered and the World wishes to have answers. Quatermass believes that the presence of the alien ship and the strange happenings within Hobbs End are linked, believing there to be some kind of hidden part of the Human Mind which can be used to manipulate the area around them. Going back into the station, he uses a machine which can visualise images inside the Human Mind. What he discovers is that the Aliens were once the owners of humanity on a far away planet and what is witnessed are mass-executions and purges of the alien race in order to preserve perfection. However, the arrogant military types who are superior to Quatermass believe it is all a German Propaganda trick. Can Quatermass prove that there is real danger within Hobbs End? How easy is it to lock and unlock the hidden part of the Mind and more importantly, how powerful can these hidden powers be?

It could even be considered today to be one of Freeman's Top 5 most iconic performances, easily ranking alongside The Shawshank Redemption (1994), Se7en (1995), and Million Dollar Baby (2004).Freeman effectively displays a take-charge attitude with his performance that the real life Joe Clark most likely had when he took over the real Eastside High School in Patterson, New Jersey. His best scene is when he first addresses the Eastside students in the auditorium, and swiftly expels the repeat troublemakers indefinitely. Following his rousing speech, one student, Kaneesha Carter (Karen Malina White), remarks, Mr. Clark don't play! You really can't disagree.The beginning of the movie shows the thriving educational institution Eastside High School was in the late 1960's, when Joe Clark first taught there. 20 years later, the promising early days of Eastside were long gone, as the school gradually decayed into a dangerous, run-down inner city public school.The first 20 minutes of Lean On Me shows what still ranks as one of the most intense and (somehow) least exploitative depictions of a typical day in a bad inner city public school. Guns N Roses' classic Welcome To The Jungle is the most fitting song. It may not be fun and games, but it's enough to bring you to your kneesHallways fights occur daily, drug dealers frequently visit, and bars cover the windows. Even a young kid getting trapped in his locker only results in a custodian shaking his head in apathy. Just like A Tale of Two Cities, where French peasants are drinking wine off the Paris streets, things are bad!Much to the reluctance of Patterson Mayor Don Bottman (Alan North), Dr. Frank Napier (Robert Guillaume) convinces Joe Clark to take over as principal of Eastside High, and attempt to restore its former glory. Clark, who was fired from the school 20 years ago due to budget cuts, reluctantly agrees. However, Clark takes charge in a way Dr. Napier never expected.Mr. Clark's unorthodox methods of discipline are probably still the subject of hot debate. Was his expelling the troublemakers on his first day the right thing to do? I think so, especially given the opening credits. However, a number of angry parents, especially Leonna Barrett (Lynne Thigpen), think otherwise.Lynne Thigpen was a great actress, and she did well in her role here as a community member who is against Mr. Clark from the start. However, her character lacked definition. We know she's a parent of someone who attended Eastside High, but we never see her child. It's implied that her child was expelled, but she seems way too dedicated a community member to let her child fall through the cracks.Most importantly, her character seems completely unaware of the mess that Eastside High was before Mr. Clark became principal. Was she ever in the high school, let alone when a fight occurred? Thigpen did what she could with the character, but Ms. Barrett needed to be more established.Similarly, all the teachers we see appear more dedicated than Mr. Clark gives them credit for being. That's not a bad thing, but we never see any inept or corrupt teachers. We just see Mr. Clark unjustly fire music teacher Mrs. Elliot (Robin Bartlett), and even more unreasonably suspend Mr. Darnell (Michael Beach), the latter of whom Dr. Napier even describes as a good, strong young Black teacher.Did Mr. Clark fire teachers like them in real life? I don't know, but he may have. However, the real Eastside High must have had corrupt teachers who took part in the drug trade, had sex with students, or did similarly inappropriate and illegal things. These kinds of behaviors do happen in high schools across America, especially decaying inner-city public schools. The latter schools just have more tolerance for it.When you see Mr. Clark immediately fire a good teacher for not teaching students the school song, it makes him out to be a bully. If you saw him throwing a teacher out of school for selling drugs, that action would be more justifiable, and the audience would be better able to sympathize with him.Then there's the case of putting locks and chains on the doors. Mr. Clark orders the school security guards to do this after an altercation with a suspended student who came back into school with a knife in his hand. This order gets Mr. Clark in trouble with both the mayor and Fire Chief Gaines (John Ring), who correctly declare the action a fire hazard.You can understand Mr. Clark's motivation for putting on the chains there are dangerous people outside, and one of their friends can just push open the doors and let them in. Plus, the school doesn't have the budget for doors that unlock automatically in case of emergency. On the other hand, the Fire Chief has a point too. This conflict is probably what got the real Mr. Clark in trouble, and you can tell because it's very complicated. There are easy solutions to this problem, but like many problems in America's educational system, they are not attainable ones.There is a lot Lean On Me does right, beginning with casting Morgan Freeman and Robert Guillaume. It's also inspiring to see the students who stay in Eastside High School warm up to Mr. Clark, and appreciate his disciplinary actions as tough love.However, the antagonists in this movie caused the most inconsistency, seemingly not even acknowledging a lot of the good Mr. Clark did, which unquestionably outweighed the bad. If these characters actually stepped out of the movie and watched the opening credit sequence, they may have changed their minds. Then again, Mr. Clark seemed to be the only character who saw the big picture. It's hard to say.

Robert Walker is likewise as convincing as Granger in his depiction of a helpless young guy, who is unwittingly placed in a bizarre and shocking situation, without even a chance of turning back. With is well-written script, beautiful and rich visuals, memorable scenes (the killing and close-up of the glasses), and Hitchcock's most precise direction, Stranger on a Train marks another milestone in the Master's career.

I mean, the acting is totally goofy, the CGI looks like it was drawn on Paint and the story is about as fluent and coherent as...well... It isn't! I found myself confused as to whether Jeremy Irons was the main villain or the comic relief, mainly because his acting is more OTT than the whole of Battlefield Earth. Not only does he yell his lines like he was having an orgasm, but he also pulls some of the strangest facial expressions I've ever seen, some I didn't think could be pulled. The CGI is obvious and uselessly rusty, making Dragons look like pixelated messes from a 1980s NES game and as for the rest, I don't care thinking about it. The story has little to no purpose and Dragon's hardly ever appear, only one at the beginning, and about 5 or 6 at the end, the rest is just a group of kids running away from Jeremy 'Overacting' Irons and his accomplice who looks like he forgot to wash his mouth after brushing his teeth. They do end up in a few dungeons I give you that, but the rest is just running, and fighting. When I say fighting, I don't mean fighting like epic sword battles from Star Wars Revenge of the Sith or Lord of the Rings, I mean just repetitive swings of the sword at each other, just continuous up\/down swings that just get boring. Overall, a really really weak film that is best kept clear of. If you come home drunk one night and are in the mood for something stupid, this is your film...
