With the female vampire dead the link to earth was broken and the ship took off, having picked up a lot of Lifeforce from hundreds of thousands of souls. Enough to re-energize those hexagon cells and create new bat creatures. It seems they do not have carnal sex, like vampires of legend. vampire bats from outer space may be ludicrous, but killing them with with a shot to qui force center below the heart is consistent. All you can ask for is consistency. The viewer has to suspend disbelief, even for scifi. The only problem is having to be a sword or stake, not bullets. That puts in a supernatural twist that does not fit with sci-fi. So that is a problem. The only major inconsistency I found is killing the male vampires with the sword, but the soul of the girl and Carlsen go up to the ship. I assume the males souls also went up the ship, but not shown. What about all the humans killed? Do their qui forces (souls) go up to the ship as discrete entities, are does all the lifeforce get merged into one, for use as ship sees fit? In other words, all the human souls that went to the ship could be re-incarnated as bat creatures. The basic concept is no more ridiculous than Star Wars Force or even re-incarnation. This movie was over the top, kitchen sink (Dawn of the Dead meets Alien meets Dracula), but in many ways profound. It was also a beautiful love story. The beginning and end were ethereal. It both began (what is happening to me) and ended as a love story. Most of the criticism of the movie is about its being bizarre.So what? Bizarre is an art form. As far as being ludicrous, it all fits. The plague concept is much more interesting and subtle than the Aliens just killing people. Maybe they didn't need Patrick Steward's blood to form an image of the girl, but it was a very far out, surreal, scene. Another reason the movie is hated is because of the end. But the end fits perfectly with the beginning. People are so wrapped up in the nude girl that they miss the movie's core. Its a lover story,from start to finish. It starts with Carlsen and the girl on the alien spaceship and finished same way. So it fits perfectly. Most people are fixated on the hero killing the monster, and this movie did not end that way, which is precisely why I love it. Instead, it has a happy ending, with the 2 of them going back to ship, to be reborn. Way cooler than the hero kills monster end, but that is exactly why it bombed. It was not a straight-up horror or even scifi\/horror at all, but a love story, with a beautiful beginning and end. All those souls twinkling on the ship. And the crystal room pulsating with new life. Most people can't deal with a love story that is also Alien meets Dawn of the Dead meets Dracula.

I thought Dumb and Dumber was funny but I'm not a huge fan of that type of comedy, Bruce Almighty was rather average and the less said about Batman & Robin the better. However I loved Cable Guy which is why I find it so odd others don't. Carrey is superb and carries the film almost single-handedly producing some genuinely classic comic scenes including the 'Dont You Want Somebody to Love' karaoke scene, the beating of Owen Wilson in the toilets by Carrey dressed as some kind of Freddie Mercury lookalike and everyone's favourite, the truly hilarious 'Porno Password' scene. The best for me though is the dream scene where he is trying to bang down Broderick's front door which is as disturbing as it is hysterical. Matthew Broderick wasn't as bad as some critics made out but its Carrey's film all the way, hes only been better in The Truman Show, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and perhaps Man on the Moon. This is also my favourite Ben Stiller directed film to date, he took a gamble with what could have been a flop (it wasn't it actually made a substantial profit despite critics suggesting otherwise) but his bravery paid off, I'd like to see him do another dark comedy but he seems to have settled into making your average run-off-the mill type comedies in the Farrelly brothers mold which I think he should leave with them as they seem to have nailed the genre down, although this isn't necessarily a bad thing I did enjoy Zoolander and I've heard Tropic Thunder is good.Still I hope Stiller has another shot at this type of film, I just hope the unfairly poor reviews haven't put him off. Also I hope Carrey starts taking some more daring roles, he has so much talent that he could be winning all types of awards including an Oscar but he is quickly being typecast as little more than a slapstick comic, which sadly he could end up being remembered as.

He joins with a couple of old friends of his father to join in heading for their claim. At the same time, a young wolf cub is being brought up in the wilderness by his mother who, in a sequence concerning Conroy (Hawke) is shot and injured when she tries to lure one of Conroy's friend's dogs away to attack (and undoubtedly eat).And now comes the tarnishing part of the film that is the one part that I loathe and despise. She drags herself back to her cub before dying in front of him and leaving him to fend for himself in the wilderness. It's very frustrating to see Disney resort to the Bambi-esquire cliché of killing off the mummy to tug at the heartstrings, especially since there's no evidence of this in the book, his mother was actually an important character, and not to forget that most of us will have seen it all before! The sequence in the book that this campfire part is based on, was before White Fang was even born, and the gradual growing climax that it built in the Jack London novel is terrifying! (Though I suppose that has no place in a Disney film.) If you intend to read the book, I won't spoil it for you!Afterwards, Conroy comes across the pup in certain circumstances where he has been taken in by the Indians and changes hands to take part in illegal dog-fighting before winding up in the hands of Conroy to rehabilitate him. These plot lines follow fairly accurately to the original London novel, albeit with some deviations, e.g White Fang's mother was called Kiche and was taken in by the Indians, only to be separated from White Fang when she was sold to another Indian, Jack Conroy never appeared in the book, though he is similar to Weedon Scott's character in the novel.The ending to White Fang was bugged with one or two clichés, in that with a gold claim freshly unearthed and ready to leave for California, he lets him free because he'd be miserable in a city though White Fang went TO a new urban home later. We're not too sure why Jack decides to stay in the wilderness either, especially when there's a new life as a rich man in California waiting, except for White Fang to return to him and for them to be reunited (as they are) and a possible instinct of this happening, but it's not very well explained.It's also totally different to that of the ending of the book (that ends in California in the same way Call of the Wild starts there), but before I condemn it, I still have some praise for it being not so lassie-esquire to the effect of being nauseating, satisfying in its own right and closing the story nicely.Perplexingly though, the end tacks on a concluding text from the Defenders of Wildlife that says that JACK LONDON'S White Fang is a work of fiction. There has never been a documented case of a healthy wolf or pack of wolves attacking a human in North America. Because wolves were systematically eliminated throughout most of the United States during our early history and continue to be persecuted today, a nationwide effort is underway to reintroduce wolves into wilderness areas and insure their survival for generations to come. Firstly, White Fang is set in Canada (sorry to be picky but people may still think that wolves have attacked people elsewhere).Secondly, I don't see why the film needs an epilogue like this - it isn't a nature documentary, it's a story! Maybe this is because the film is from 18 years ago when people were more prejudiced about wolves, and though I think wolves are great animals and it is important to protect them, it seems unnecessary to tack this information on at the end!In general, I would recommend this film, whether you've read the book or not. Despite the faults I've listed and the Godawful Bambi-style rubbish, White Fang does have its saving graces. The relationship between Conroy and White Fang is excellently portrayed, and quite poignantly acted by Hawke and Jed the wolf (or wolf-dog, whichever one he falls into). The backdrops of Canada in both Spring and Winter are nothing short of breathtaking, and combined with the settings of the late 19th Century, put us in a real and harsh, but beautiful world that draws you in. If you've read the book, then remember it's Disney and they are liable to changing story material for film-making.

We're not too sure why Jack decides to stay in the wilderness either, especially when there's a new life as a rich man in California waiting, except for White Fang to return to him and for them to be reunited (as they are) and a possible instinct of this happening, but it's not very well explained.It's also totally different to that of the ending of the book (that ends in California in the same way Call of the Wild starts there), but before I condemn it, I still have some praise for it being not so lassie-esquire to the effect of being nauseating, satisfying in its own right and closing the story nicely.Perplexingly though, the end tacks on a concluding text from the Defenders of Wildlife that says that JACK LONDON'S White Fang is a work of fiction. There has never been a documented case of a healthy wolf or pack of wolves attacking a human in North America. Because wolves were systematically eliminated throughout most of the United States during our early history and continue to be persecuted today, a nationwide effort is underway to reintroduce wolves into wilderness areas and insure their survival for generations to come. Firstly, White Fang is set in Canada (sorry to be picky but people may still think that wolves have attacked people elsewhere).Secondly, I don't see why the film needs an epilogue like this - it isn't a nature documentary, it's a story! Maybe this is because the film is from 18 years ago when people were more prejudiced about wolves, and though I think wolves are great animals and it is important to protect them, it seems unnecessary to tack this information on at the end!In general, I would recommend this film, whether you've read the book or not. Despite the faults I've listed and the Godawful Bambi-style rubbish, White Fang does have its saving graces. The relationship between Conroy and White Fang is excellently portrayed, and quite poignantly acted by Hawke and Jed the wolf (or wolf-dog, whichever one he falls into). The backdrops of Canada in both Spring and Winter are nothing short of breathtaking, and combined with the settings of the late 19th Century, put us in a real and harsh, but beautiful world that draws you in. If you've read the book, then remember it's Disney and they are liable to changing story material for film-making. Just don't take it too seriously.I wouldn't touch MYTH OF THE WHITE WOLF with a 10 ft fishing pole, though!

All three of the aforementioned films, and The Search for Spock certainly capture the unique friendships and sense of camaraderie the TOS crew share, but in those films all that is forced to share the spotlight in those films with oncoming disasters, space battles, and villains.There is an oncoming disaster the crew must work to stop in The Voyage Home, but, in the words of Leonard Nimoy no dying, no fighting, no shooting, no photon torpedoes, no phaser blasts, no stereotypical bad guy. The result is not only one hell of a fun film, but a truly excellent piece of Trek writing, one which gives even Chekov something of note to do, stays true to every character, achieves emotional poignancy during the scenes with Kirk and Spock awkwardly re-establishing their friendship, and provides a lighthearted plot which nonetheless explores some big ideas (and ideals).Amongst time travel Trek The Voyage Home is definitely bested by The City on the Edge of Forever, Yesterday's Enterprise, and The Visitor from TOS, TNG, and DS9 respectively, and is probably slightly less fun than DS9's legendary Trials and Tribble-ations but overall is an incredibly entertaining, fun time travel story better than any others that I haven't mentioned (including the films Generations and First Contact). The plot, which sees the crew go back in time to 1986 San Francisco to take humpback whales to the future to repopulate the species and save Earth works much better than you'd expect, but the movie really shines when the crew is in San Francisco in 1986 attempting to get the whales back to the future. Uhura and Chekov's quest for nuclear wessels, Scotty revealing the formula for transparent aluminum to a manufacturer, and especially, especially, Bones' hilarious outrage at the barbaric medical practices of the 20th century during his time at a hospital are a few of the highlights.The script went through a lot to get to the final draft, but Nimoy stated that Nicholas Meyer gave the script the kind of humor and social comment, gadfly attitude I very much wanted, so I guess we have Nicholas Meyer to thank once again for a great Trek adventure. You know, they haven't announced a director for the sequel to J.J. Abrams canonical reboot out May 8th yet, it's not too late to ask him to return... Harve Bennett, who had a hand in this entire trilogy (II, III, and IV, together one of the best film trilogies of all time), also deserves credit, and whomever the other writers were I'm sure. Great screenplay brought to life wonderfully well by Leonard Nimoy's direction (he really appears to have grown as a director since The Search for Spock), good cinematography, good design work, and superb effects.Some dismiss The Voyage Home as silly and indulgent. I view it as a fantastic piece of violence-free Trek, and after a wildly off-mark attempt at hard sci-fi and two extravagant, though emotionally-grounded space adventures, the film series was wise to finally bring to the big screen what the original television series often did very well a humorous fish out of water story with great characters, excellent dialogue, and a good overall story.

The story is based on the Sheila Burnford novel, and is a reason why it's not possible to write this one off as a brainless Lassie clone.The basic story Two dogs and a cat happily live in the Seaver family when the new husband to the mother of the three children, gets a job in the city and they have to temporarily move into inner San Francisco while the animals are sent to a ranch to live for a couple of months. The bonds between the animals and the children they watch out for are especially strong, and Shadow the golden retriever and Sassy the Himalayan cat are heartbroken as the children are, though the young and happy-go-lucky American Bulldog known as Chance is a little less concerned and somewhat cynical (due in part to his voice-over explaining his being abandoned as a pup, picked up to an animal shelter, and being bought by the family), though his growth as a character during the story provides much of the important storytelling.The three pets escape the ranch and head off into the wide and dangerous wilderness (fantastic wilderness settings by the way), driven on by Shadow's instincts of direction. They meet several perils along the way, hoping to make it home, while the family and the ranch hosts are suddenly concerned about the animal disappearance. There are funny moments all the way through, great dialogue between the three animals and hilarious lines (see - memorable quotes), and a touching comradeship that grows between the main characters during the course of the storytelling, punctuated by moments of sadness (such as when Sassy's arrogance of trying to cross a river without getting wet causes her to fall in the river and get washed down a waterfall, leaves a moment of loss that is felt deeply by the viewers).Somehow though, I fail to see what the inclusion of saving the girl lost in the wilderness adds to the story and the journey they take. Somehow, it seems a little unnecessary as part of the story.The ending cranks the stakes higher when shadow falls into a pit in a trainyard and having hurt his leg, finds it hard to get out and gives up, exhausted, followed by Chance climbing in with him to persuade him to climb out, telling him how important he is to him and how he's pushed them this far so he shouldn't throw it all away so easily. The way that this scene (brilliantly done) isn't concluded leaves an ambiguity that carries on into the final scene when Chance and Sassy return home, but Shadow is nowhere to be seen. Then just as all seems lost, he slowly appears, and is reunited with the family. Chance's conclusion at the end speaks of the comradeship that has developed between he and his fellows on the journey, and the realisation to what home really is from his long journey to get there, leaves a fine epilogue to demonstrate how much his character has grown, but also how the other two have as well.

They have to get the leak under control, turn around, and get back to Earth, in the midst of solving a seemingly endless number of problems that crop up. Apollo 13 is a drama that takes place in space, and winds up being more suspenseful than many of the science fiction\/action movies today. Just the sound of the alarms and the sight of Oxygen levels dropping are enough to keep the viewer on the edge of their seat. It keeps you rooting for the good guys to come home safely even though we know how the film will end. I must compliment how educational the film really is. By all accounts the film is pretty accurate, and one can learn a lot about space travel in the 70's from Apollo 13. This film proves historical films can be accurate and entertaining at the same time. The film's greatest strength however is a stellar cast. Tom Hanks, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris are all likable and easy to relate to. We sympathize with Hanks, who plays Jim Lovell, because he will never realize his dream of walking on the moon. Fred Haise (Bill Paxton) falls ill and has kids on the way. We feel sorry for Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon) because we can't help but feel there is an unnecessary antagonism toward him because he was not originally assigned to the mission.

We all sympathize with Gene Kranz (Ed Harris) and the rest of mission control, who work day and night to get Apollo 13 home. Finally, there is Marilyn Lovell (Kathleen Quinlan), who can only wait helplessly and pray her husband will come back.

A friend mentioned his work in Babel (2006) and how great that was. I hadn't seen his earlier films including this one which is now nine years old. As I went back to Amores Perros, It caught my eyes as a work of art. From the moment it started, Alejandro uses many film techniques which intervene the characters and certain parts of the plot with each other. I personally love the alternative film making in some films and this is shown well with Amores Perros.As part of the death trilogy now. Alejandro's first film truly shines out to be the best of the three. The film traces three different characters who really have nothing to do with each other until the end, where a car crash takes place and we see the different characters reactions and relation somehow to the accident. As the plot unfolds so do the characters such as Octavio, who changes due to love. The overall understanding of what Amores Perros stands for could in fact be the English title; Love's a Bitch. Which is quite accurate when considering the symbolism in this film. Dogs are used throughout, which somehow resembles the bitch in the title. The overall title meaning could certainly link the relationship of dogs and people together and that how unjustly it may seem, that people show emotions in everything they do. In Amores Perros, we could consider, the tragedy of a close friend, the fight with the brother, love of the sister in law and even the companion between life of a dog and human beings. The overall message is that life is sometimes cruel when dealing with any relationship in life.The overall review comes down to whether you like a strong drama, and if you haven't seen this film. My word would be to rent out the three films of the trilogy together Amores Perros, 21 Grams and Babel. All three films are brilliant and have similar film styles, but different stories. It's great to see such a director make his debut film a classic. Well done Alejandro. And a good praise to the main star Gael García Bernal for giving a remarkable performance.Go see this film!

Caleb Deschanel's cinematography of flying geese is more than merely uplifting, like the film, it is extraordinary, and well deserved its Oscar nomination. This charming and delightful film is based upon the well-known fact that birds can 'imprint' on whoever or whatever is there when they hatch, and in this case it is the 14 year-old actress Anna Paquin. She was well worth imprinting on, as she is every bit as delightful as the film as a whole. Now that she is all grown up and glamorous, I wouldn't mind imprinting on her myself. - Give me an eggshell, quick! - The story is a wonderful fable about the girl who saves the goose eggs, hatches them, and becomes their Momma. They follow her around everywhere, but wild geese have to migrate, so she is faced with the dilemma what to do at migration time? The girl's father is an eccentric, beautifully portrayed by Jeff Daniels. He is always tinkering with machines and likes to build what we now call 'micro-lites', tiny planes with engines that go 'put put' and carry a single person at low altitudes. So you guessed it, father and daughter get into their micro-lites and lead the geese south! Apparently, wild geese will follow a micro-lite if it is shaped like a goose. The story is a magnificent fable which is just believable, sensitively portrayed and with fabulous cinematography and special effects. It is what is called these days, amidst all the blood and gore and obsession with closeups of copulation, a 'family film', meaning no murders take place and people do something other than have sex all the time. (In a normal Hollywood movie it would be impossible to take the geese south because it would mean the director could not ask lots of actresses to take their clothes off.) Carroll Ballard directs this film really well. He is one of those rare directors who does not want to have all his characters mown down by machine guns or chopped to pieces by maniacs, and he does not want to invent unnecessary bath scenes where the girls show their tits so that he can get his jollies. He also likes animals a lot, and that is always a good sign that he might himself not be a monster like so many other directors are.

It takes great amounts of talent and a sensitive spirit to make a gripping, involving narration of something as common as two married couples with communication, emotional and sexual problems -but Alan Rudolph not only manages to do this, but offers us an absolutely perfect narration, filled with beauty and a sensitive and compassionate look on some of the most common human weaknesses, mistakes, wishes, and dreams.The movie introduces us to two couples the middle-aged Manns, Lucky (Nolte) and Phyllis (a sublime Christie), and the in-their-thirties Byrons, Jeffrey (Miller) and Marianne (Boyle). The former are working class, and the latter are well-off. Both are in the middle of a crisis, due to different reasons, but parenthood and their sex life (or lack thereof) are some of the most obvious. Basically, the movie lets us have a look into each of the characters' desires and dreams, what they want out of their marriage and of life. Logically, the older couple has more regrets about the past, and each of the younger partners is more looking forward to a better future. The four people will become involved with each other in different ways, all full of potential for something better... or for disaster.All in all, the story is easy to follow and, although calm, it is never boring; all of the scenes reveal something important about the characters. Like some other commentators said, Rudolph has an especially good understanding of the female mind, and he is an admirer of the female beauty -he brings out the best, most beautiful and most admirable in Lara Flynn Boyle and Julie Christie, but also of other supporting female characters.The movie isn't as predictable as one might think, it isn't merely a story of dissatisfaction and relationship problems, and it has a few surprises in store for the viewer, but nothing too extravagant or hard to believe. It is, ultimately, a finely crafted parable of the loss of passion -for life, for love, for our dreams and aspirations- and how it is possible to get it back.I would recommend this movie to anyone.

The guys are subjected to This Island Earth by the familiar Dr. Forrester. In between the condensed movie, there are 5 sketches. Dr. Forrester's mad-scientist soliloquy & Crow drilling a hole to the Earth can be considered the first part. When the film melts and breaks is part two. There are two interocitor sketches and the credits.Dr. Cal Meacham is a gifted and important atomic scientist. So important that Lockheed lets him commute to work in one of their vehicles. A commute to work is flying a jet from DC to somewhere across the country. As Cal arrives at work the plane malfunctions, but (thankfully) he is saved by a mysterious and pulsating green glow. At work, more strange things appear. This time an ordering mishap occurs, giving Cal a capacitor of incredible specifications. A delivery of a metal-page catalog arrives and continues the strangeness, which ultimately leads to an ordering spree and the creation of an interocitor.Next, a strange white-haired man, named Exeter, appears on the interocitor & reveals all. He admits that the catalog, the parts & their assembly were a test to verify his aptitude. Exeter is a recruiter for a scientific think-tank. Cal can't resist and ends up at a utopian-like mansion full of the world's best scientists. Some typical snooping later, the development of a love interest (Dr. Ruth, if only it were her) & the Professor's help, lead to the truth; Exeter is an alien and they are going to his home planet of Metaluna, with Cal & Ruth tagging along. BIG Surprise, right? No. Not at all actually. HELLO!. There are aliens on the movie posters even before you would have walked into the theater.I remember seeing this movie as a child on AMC on a Saturday afternoon. It was one of the first science fiction movies that had better than average production value and a plot line that was a bit more than an alien-western or alien-horror story. It's not perfect and it isn't Forbidden Planet (the overall best sci-fi movie of the 50's; story, special effects,etc.) either, but it is fast paced and enjoyable. Most sci-fi of the time is about an alien out to destroy us & our attempts to stop them. This Island Earth adds a small layer of actual science, some sympathetic extraterrestrials and colorful special effects to create something worth remembering. There are genuine attempts at science fiction here, restricted by the budget, studios and audience perception of the genre. Don't expect 2001 A Space Odyssey, but it's not Plan 9 from Outer Space either.This is by far the best production value of anything with Mystery Science Theater 3000 on it.

The result is most entertaining, and Emma Watson was perfectly cast as the character Hermione. The production is full of famous actors, some recognisable, some not. Robbie Coltrane is particularly effective and endearing, with a broad Somerset accent, of all things! Maggie Smith has little to do but wrinkle her nose. But there is little point in discussing a production which has been reviewed to death and talked about until everyone has lost their breath, and there is nothing to add about all that. In America, this film title used the phrase 'sorcerer's stone' because Americans were presumably considered too ill-educated to know what the Philosopher's Stone is. In Britain and Canada, the title used the correct phrase of 'the Philosopher's Stone'. The Philosopher's Stone (correctly shown in the film as being red in colour) is reputed to have existed, but no one is certain. It was the end-product of alchemy, and had the ability to turn all metals into gold if you sprinkled a little of it on, say, lead, for instance. It also could produce a medicine to allow you to live indefinitely in good health, perhaps for centuries. J. K. Rowling sticks some genuine esoterica into her stories sometimes, and in this one she incorporated the fourteenth century alchemist Nicolas Flamel, whose presumed dates are sometimes given as 1330-1418. He really existed, and his tombstone may be seen in the Musee de Cluny in Paris, on the left as you go up a staircase, affixed to a wall. The staff of the Museum either do not know or pretend not to know who Flamel is, and 'if ye seek ye shall not find', as they all look blank. As far as I know, I may be the only person who has fully deciphered the symbology of this strange stone. Flamel faked his own death to avoid arrest and imprisonment by the French king, who wanted to keep him captive and force him to make gold for him. The tombstone was designed by Flamel himself before he disappeared. For a long time it rested in place in the nave of the Paris church of Saint-Jacques la Boucherie, but that church was demolished long ago, with only its high tower remaining. The Tour Saint-Jacques has now had its scaffolding removed, and is looking splendid and clean. It has long been the symbol of modern French esotericism (which the French call esoterisme), and a famous French esoteric periodical even bore its name. The tombstone was salvaged from the demolition and used for many years, turned upside-down, as a chopping-board for herbs, by a herb-seller in his shop. It was recognised in the 19th century and preserved by an antiquary. The old stone house of Flamel, known as 'the oldest house in Paris', still stands and you can go and eat there in a small and expensive restaurant called after Flamel. There are even two little streets in the vicinity of the Tour named Rue Nicolas Flamel and Rue Perenelle, the latter of which is named for his wife and alchemical collaborator. In the film, Flamel is said still to be alive, and the Stone is his, although he does not appear in the story himself. What happened to Flamel, who was Fulcanelli, all of these things are continuing mysteries which are far more interesting than any J. K. Rowling story. Nevertheless, it is good that young people are being given a small dose of these things in palatable form by Rowling, as it might open their minds, if they can stop texting trivia to each other for long enough to allow their minds to be opened, that is.

I'm a great fan of the Merchant\/Ivory cannon, and believe them to be unbeatable in their perfection of the Ideal. Here we are given a masterful lesson by Roger Michell in the perfectly Real. And it's OK to like both. I do not agree at all with the premise that romance and long dresses make any movie a chick flick, which is a fairly modern invention - both in grammar and a particular vein of shallow popular movie making. This is not that, and I cannot watch a true chick flick - they're not even good movies, none of them will be named here, you know which ones they are.Most of the well known period pieces made in the last 20 years are some of the very best movies we have. I think them not so much an acquired taste, as an appreciation that must be learned. Like many of the finer things and varied seasons of your life, it took someone showing you before you knew what you were looking at, or looking for. It is that way here. Once you see the truth they have to tell, then decide you don't prefer them - at least you've validated your own choice through actual experience. But to dismiss them out of hand from ignorance, or prejudice, or misplaced masculinity makes such a view less relevant. And I think more importantly, causes you to miss out on something you might find quite beautiful, had you seen it.For the uninitiated, let me take a moment to explain. It is the inner beauty of good people, the proper behavior and right conduct toward others as a societal norm - just because they are others like yourself, not because you wanted anything from them. Real Gentleman and True Ladies. This all happened for the first time in history on this scale and at this level within the Victorian and Edwardian eras. Though this is the period right before the Victorian, they are directly connected and that's what is on display here. It will feed your spirit if you let it. All of which comes out of the ethics and morality of Christian nations, and does not trace back to any other cultures on the earth.Just as the West came out of the Greece of Alexander, the modern world was birthed by the Britain of this time, and everyone knows it. The turn into the 20th century is the end of the England we Americans as a society, came out of. We did not get this goodness in us as a nation from ourselves, we got it from someone who had it before us. Good Infection as C.S. Lewis calls it. There is hypocrisy, contradiction and cruelty, of course, and people who are not so nice - that comes with a fallen race. But that is not what you are being shown. There is no excellence in the error of men, there is no light in their darkness. Darkness is the absence of Light - Light displaces it. All of the bad that men have done to each other is hardly worth making a film about, on it's own.Good films come from good stories, and stories get their strength from the Power of Words. Like the ones I'm using here. It's a power that God put into words, man had nothing to do with it. Films and stories are important only because Words are important. If it sounds like I'm preaching a little, you can't fault me for that - that's what Preachers do. So do film makers, film goers, writers, and people - like you. All with something to say, when given a chance - will say it. And everything ever said will be Judged.Thus ends my attempt at persuasion, for those of you who might give great period pieces a view. Let their good words minister, let their morality speak. In an age where people have become products, and talk is cheap. You'll get a little bit of help from the Light that is in them. A spoonful at a time is all we are given, because a spoonful is all we can handle. Pictures, and words and stories of the way people used to be. The goodness of God is the goodness that you see. Including the goodness in films like Persuasion - an example of how good film making ought to be.

Like many of the finer things and varied seasons of your life, it took someone showing you before you knew what you were looking at, or looking for. It is that way here. Once you see the truth they have to tell, then decide you don't prefer them - at least you've validated your own choice through actual experience. But to dismiss them out of hand from ignorance, or prejudice, or misplaced masculinity makes such a view less relevant. And I think more importantly, causes you to miss out on something you might find quite beautiful, had you seen it.For the uninitiated, let me take a moment to explain. It is the inner beauty of good people, the proper behavior and right conduct toward others as a societal norm - just because they are others like yourself, not because you wanted anything from them. Real Gentleman and True Ladies. This all happened for the first time in history on this scale and at this level within the Victorian and Edwardian eras. Though this is the period right before the Victorian, they are directly connected and that's what is on display here. It will feed your spirit if you let it. All of which comes out of the ethics and morality of Christian nations, and does not trace back to any other cultures on the earth.Just as the West came out of the Greece of Alexander, the modern world was birthed by the Britain of this time, and everyone knows it. The turn into the 20th century is the end of the England we Americans as a society, came out of. We did not get this goodness in us as a nation from ourselves, we got it from someone who had it before us. Good Infection as C.S. Lewis calls it. There is hypocrisy, contradiction and cruelty, of course, and people who are not so nice - that comes with a fallen race. But that is not what you are being shown. There is no excellence in the error of men, there is no light in their darkness. Darkness is the absence of Light - Light displaces it. All of the bad that men have done to each other is hardly worth making a film about, on it's own.Good films come from good stories, and stories get their strength from the Power of Words. Like the ones I'm using here. It's a power that God put into words, man had nothing to do with it. Films and stories are important only because Words are important. If it sounds like I'm preaching a little, you can't fault me for that - that's what Preachers do. So do film makers, film goers, writers, and people - like you. All with something to say, when given a chance - will say it. And everything ever said will be Judged.Thus ends my attempt at persuasion, for those of you who might give great period pieces a view. Let their good words minister, let their morality speak. In an age where people have become products, and talk is cheap. You'll get a little bit of help from the Light that is in them. A spoonful at a time is all we are given, because a spoonful is all we can handle. Pictures, and words and stories of the way people used to be. The goodness of God is the goodness that you see. Including the goodness in films like Persuasion - an example of how good film making ought to be.

I'm a great fan of the Merchant\/Ivory cannon, and believe them to be unbeatable in their perfection of the Ideal. Here we are given a masterful lesson by Roger Michell in the perfectly Real. And it's OK to like both. I do not agree at all with the premise that romance and long dresses make any movie a chick flick, which is a fairly modern invention - both in grammar and a particular vein of shallow popular movie making.
