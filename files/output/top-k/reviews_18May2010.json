[{"date":"18 May 2010","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Geoffrey Rush stars as the notorious Marquis de Sade, languishing in an asylum, allowed some freedoms, though his appetites for causing a stir by way of his quill lands him in a lot of hot water. Kate Winslet, the laundress who moves his written work to the outside where it can be marketed underground to the people who love the Marquis' sordid tales of the violent and erotic. Joaquin Phoenix, the priest over Charenton mental institution, who treats the patients, including the Marquis, with humanity and kindness. Michael Caine, the medical scientist(more like certified torturer, whose methods include dunking the disturbed in water among other ways)who arrives at Charenton at an advisory capacity. Caine's doctor is ferocious and his way of curing the mentally ill is barbaric, a complete polar opposite to Phoenix who wants to keep his inmates free from vile experiments which do more harm than good.The movie amusingly asks us which one's worse, Caine's scientist or Rush's Marquis. Caine is commissioned by Emperor Napoleon to cure Marquis because death to such a quietly revered author might make him a martyr for the lower classes. The film shows how Caine's old man is married to a teenage virgin raised in a convent, and we see him force her into rough sex. Yet, his control over her is brief as she soon gains an advantage, his wanting to please her in ways sex can not used as a tool to get her way. Interesting development shows that Caine's wife is an avid reader of the Marquis..talk about irony.The depraved work thrown into the fire by an angered Napoleon is Justine..this is the work which repulsed him into action(a very funny scene shows Napoleon sitting upon his throne, his feet unable to touch the floor as if he were a child in a swing, legs flailing). When the Marquis pens a farce mocking Caine and his marriage to the young bride, set to a play designed to insult and ridicule for fun, he enacts a feud he will live to regret.The movie shows people appalled at the way the Marquis writes about his characters' inadequacies and devious pursuits and yet they remain curious and find his work even humorous, fighting off giggles.When the Marquis escapes from his cell, thanks to Winslet unlocking his door against her better judgment, Phoenix is forced into a predicament he'll never be able to recover from, his decency towards the patient rewarded with disregard. Basically, upon Caine's arrival, everything the priest had built falls to ruin. By the end, the lives of many will be shattered, death and anguish to all through Caine's actions. Though, despite all his underhanded tactics, no matter what he was able to accomplish in scoring a revenge against the Marquis for his wife's leaving him for a talented home decorator, influenced by the depravity and vice written by his hand, the author's work lives on no matter what the conniving scientist does to him.The movie shows that no matter what punishments are dealt him(remove his means to write, such as quills and paper, cloth and wine, etc), the Marquis finds ways to get his work to the outside world. Eventually, the evil scientist does get rid of the man, and he even sets up a printing factory using the inmates to distribute the Marquis work at the author's wife's permission, but halting the power of the one he so despises will never be easy as long as Phoenix's defrocked priest keeps his memory afresh. QUILLS includes an erotic scene where Phoenix fantasizes making love to a ravishing Winslet and Rush devours his scenes like a mutt with rabies. It's easy to see that Rush summoned the spirit of Marquis de Sade while portraying the role, I thought he wholly brought him to life in QUILLS. The asylum itself can be presented as both a refuge for the inmates and a bleak place once Caine's presence constrains the freedom they once had, his power attributing to the very Emperor who gave him absolute authority to see that order is kept.My most glorious prose..filtered through the minds of the insane.

A lot of people complained about how slow it was. (Hurry up and die!) The script is only 135 pages long, and much of that was left on the cutting room floor, yet the movie still runs for 150 minutes!  What's missing from the movie? Hana's fiancé makes several appearances in the script and it's sad when Hana learns he is dead. In the movie, she suddenly becomes depressed after somebody prattles on about Picton, as if that meant something. Kip had a major story of his own, all cut from the movie. At one point in the movie he tells Hana he wants to be found. That has a corollary in the script, but it was cut, leaving the line dangling. There's stuff about the sexuality of some of the other team members, almost all cut, but with a couple of tiny, unexplained moments left in the movie.  STORY The scene is set by a reading from Herodotus (ancient Greek historian) of the story of Candaules, king of Lydia, and Gyges, a soldier. Candaules wants Gyges to be impressed by the beauty of his naked wife, so he sets up an opportunity for Gyges to spy on her when she undresses for bed. The nameless Queen learns of what happened and tells Gyges he must either submit to death for what he's done, or kill Candaules and take his place as King. Assassination follows, with the Queen and Gyges living together happily ever after. When Geoffrey Clifton leaves his wife Katherine behind in the desert while he goes off adventuring, she comes close to dying in a sand storm. Almásy brings her through safely. Subsequently Katherine jumps into bed with Almásy, Geoffrey finds out and, consumed by jealousy tries to kill the three of them by crashing his plane into Almásy on the ground. He dies at once, Katherine dies some undefined time after, and Almásy much later.TIME The dates in the movie don't make much sense. They meet in the desert in 1938. Start the affair during that year and snatch a grubby bonk in a cupboard during the 1938 Xmas Party. The desert story ends after everyone goes home in May 1936, by command of the British Government. Almásy is supposed to be collected by Geoffrey in the plane and be taken out, except he tries to crash the plane into him instead. This must be May 1939. Almásy places the injured Katherine in a cave and heads off for help. He is arrested by the British Army, from whom he escapes, and is assisted by the German Army with fuel to fly another plane back to the cave. This suggests the military situation in North Africa of 1941 or 1942. The plane, with a perfectly preserved corpse in the front seat, is shot down by the Germans (date unknown). Almásy then appears as the Patient in an Allied Hospital train in 1944 in Italy. He lingers until after the European war ends in May 1945. ROMANCE This is, allegedly, a romantic movie. The romance consists of a married woman having an affair with a bloke she meets in the desert. The high point is the second time they're shown getting together, on her first wedding anniversary, while the cuckolded husband sits in a taxi outside the hotel waiting for her to reappear. He is aware of what is going on inside, but confines his response to sucking warm champagne out of a bottle. If that is romance, I know I could live a long time without any, thank you so much. BODICE RIPPER At the high point of passion, Almásy rips Katherine's blouse open. He is rewarded with sight of a chest to match that of many adolescent males. As compensation, Kristin Scott Thomas provides a view of her pubic region as she decamps a bath. Sexy? No. This is followed by Almásy sewing the blouse together again, which is as close as the movie comes to unbridled excitement.If you enjoy lingering views of desert sand, try LAWRENCE OF ARABIA.
