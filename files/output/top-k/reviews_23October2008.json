In X2 it was a plot by a corrupt Fed to kill all the mutants using Xavier (Patrick Stewart). In X3 a cure is found that makes all mutants human. Cure indeed. Who said the mutants were sick? Such is the view of the mutant self-proclaimed leader Magneto. In the final chapter, Magneto fears that the cure will be forced upon the mutant population and wages war against the source of the cure with the aim to destroy it and anything that gets in his and his loyal followers way. All three movies are suspenseful and exciting. No bathroom break urges in these films. New mutants are hatched in each film and some of our favorite mutants are dispatched (quite early on in X3). Special effects are 5-stars. If you've not seen any of the movies (or all of the movies) in the trilogy, this 3-pack is a great opportunity to see a classic tale in chronological order and own a classic 3-part tale in the genre that belongs in any sci-fi fan's collection. Hugh Jackman is excellent in the tough-guy roll as Wolverine (we like you better as a tough guy, Hugh); Halle Berry (Storm), Anna Paquin (Rogue), James Marsden (Cyclops) and Rebecca Romijn (Mystique) are all spot-on too. And Famke Janssen is Phoenix whose character is key to the trilogy. Beast is in X3 too, actually played by (to my surprise in the rolling credits)...Kelsey Grammar! Now there's a real mutation!

But to me is one of the bravest and most mature Freddy movies, it is darker than its predecessor, and it deals with many social issues that are still very much relevant in this day such as, abortion, teen pregnancy, bulimia, failed family relationships, etc. I think Freddy is just a metaphor in this movie, representing that thing inside of us that wants to destroy us in those hard times, especially being teenagers. The writers did an excellent job and all these things don't feel forced at all.Lisa Wilcox is once again excellent as the title character, after the great character development on the previous movie, the character remains stronger than ever, not only dealing with a fantasy monster but with what could be real life problems for anyone, and it's a shame that she hasn't been brought back for closure, especially considering Lisa Wilcox has expressed interest in coming back as Alice for a new movie. Sadly, with the remake of the original, which is a total wasted opportunity and the murder of an entire franchise, that won't happen... The special effects are much better than in Part 4, and it continues exploring Freddy's origins that were revealed in Part 3.This whole franchise, not counting Freddy Vs Jason (wich was just... bad) is very underrated, it managed to remain fresh in its hidden themes, every Nightmare film has layers and it's sad that some people cannot see this. It is not just a bunch of teenagers getting killed, like in other franchises, and for the people paying attention, the Freddy resurrections are well explained and do have a point in the storyline.Sure, some of the sequels aren't scary, but they bring more to the table than a bunch of teenagers you won't even remember their names afterwards getting killed every 5 minutes... but to each their own.

The basic plot outline makes it sound like a fairy tale for children- a stableboy and a wealthy girl fall in love, the boy is kidnapped and presumed killed, only to return to save her from marrying an evil prince, blah, blah, blah. Please excuse me if I ruined the plot for you, but this movie is not about the plot. After all, it follows a formula seen a million times; what separates The Princess Bride from others like it is the way it goes about its business. The Princess Bride doesn't simply tell a nice story; it creates some of the most hilarious characters and scenes ever seen on the big screen.Cary Elwes is the stableboy Westley, who falls for the beautiful Buttercup (that's right, Buttercup- played by Robin Wright Penn), but he is kidnapped by the Dread Pirate Roberts. She eventually gets engaged to the conniving Prince Humperdinck but never stops loving Westley. True love conquers all when Westley miraculously returns and defeats a swordsman, a giant, and a genius before re-teaming up with Buttercup.The Princess Bride is, simply put, one of the funniest and most brilliant movies I've ever seen. Mandy Patinkin is utterly phenomenal as Inigo Montoya, a man who only wants to avenge his father's murder at the hands of a six-fingered man. Andre the Giant also has a hilarious turn as Fezzik, an enormous oaf whose heart is as big as his muscles.You know how this movie is going to end before you even watch it (I won't spoil it for you in case you haven't figured it out). But the ending isn't what matters. It's the journey that gets you there that does. And what a journey it is. The Princess Bride has more memorable quotes and unforgettable scenes than perhaps any other movie ever made. After over fifteen viewings, I haven't even grown close to tiring of it. You've never seen a fairy tale quite like The Princess Bride; this film is a must-rent and should be a must-own. It just doesn't get any better than this.

The story is timeless, incredibly powerful and ultimately uplifting and the cast does a great job at putting it all together. Most impressive, of course, is Paul Newman who gives a very likable, well-rounded performance that exceeded my high expectations that I had built up. I'm kind of surprised that it wasn't nominated for Best Picture.The most interesting aspect of the film for me was the metaphor for the life of Christ that was displayed throughout. At the beginning of the film we see Luke engage in a boxing match where he is badly beaten, but he refuses to lay down and give up. As a result of this, his fellow prisoners in the camp become his followers. They praise him and look towards him as a leader for the rest of the film. He leads them up against the guards; not in an act of rebellion in order to overthrow the camp, but rebellion just for the sake of rebellion. Luke doesn't ever ask to become the leader of this group or to be anything more than himself. He just does things in order to pass the time, in order to entertain himself, and as a result everyone else in the camp projects these Christ-like qualities upon him. The film itself makes direct references to him being a religious symbol; his camp number 37, is a reference to the bible and after the scene where he eats fifty eggs he lays on the table in the form of a crucifix. Most interesting for me, though, was the story of his resurrection. After his second botched escape attempt, he comes back and the guards begin to beat him over and over again. They torture him for no reason other than to break him and when they finally do, they push him down into his grave, literally. But then the warden, as god, lifts him back up out of the grave and puts him back into the camp. His fellow prisoners think he is broken and that he has abandoned them, but instead he rises back up and escapes once again. I'm not a religious man by any means, but the metaphor for Luke as Christ throughout was something that I found very intriguing.The ending itself was great. Luke was finally killed but the impact of his life lived on through Dragline. The most powerful moment of the film for me was when he rose up and attacked the man with no eyes, who had served as this haunting figure looming over the prisoners for the entire film. Seeing those ominous get crushed under the tire was such a powerful anti-establishment statement. The final montage of Newman's beautiful smile could have come across as overly sentimental, but instead further served the uplifting message that the film carries all the way through. A great story highlighted by a sensational performance.

Stevenson's not gone back a century for adventure as he did in Treasure Island and Kidnapped. He's stayed in his own century and in this case in his own Scottish background, locating the story in Edinburgh.Although you wouldn't think so, the film has much more resemblance to Treasure Island than you would think in its characters. The Jim Hawkins of the piece is Russell Wade, a young man whose father is a vicar who has come to study medicine with the great Doctor Henry Daniell, a brilliant surgeon.In film Henry Daniell is cold and studied arrogance whether he's playing Professor Moriarty, Baron DeVarville, or even the Creole gentleman who wants Stuart Whitman to stay and be hanged rather than violate the code duello in The Commancheros. He's certainly not a lovable rogue, but he and Wade bond as surely as Jim Hawkins and Long John Silver do because Wade like Hawkins realizes this guy for all his faults can teach me something.Back in the day teaching doctors needed cadavers for illustration and experimentation and would look the other way and not ask too many questions where they come from. This is the part of medicine that Wade gets good and squeamish over. Boris Karloff plays John Grey in the title role of The Body Snatcher. He has a hold over Daniell and Karloff is not real particular where and how he gets his corpses.Playing Daniell's servant in a supporting role and not getting as much screen time as Karloff and Daniell is Bela Lugosi. I'm not sure why he took a supporting part here, he certainly is not called on for his usual bag of ghoulish tricks. Still it's nice to see him with Karloff and Daniell in what is their picture.Val Lewton did a fabulous job in creating the mood and tone of the underside of 19th century Edinburgh. This one is a must for fans of the principal players.

He's stayed in his own century and in this case in his own Scottish background, locating the story in Edinburgh.Although you wouldn't think so, the film has much more resemblance to Treasure Island than you would think in its characters. The Jim Hawkins of the piece is Russell Wade, a young man whose father is a vicar who has come to study medicine with the great Doctor Henry Daniell, a brilliant surgeon.In film Henry Daniell is cold and studied arrogance whether he's playing Professor Moriarty, Baron DeVarville, or even the Creole gentleman who wants Stuart Whitman to stay and be hanged rather than violate the code duello in The Commancheros. He's certainly not a lovable rogue, but he and Wade bond as surely as Jim Hawkins and Long John Silver do because Wade like Hawkins realizes this guy for all his faults can teach me something.Back in the day teaching doctors needed cadavers for illustration and experimentation and would look the other way and not ask too many questions where they come from. This is the part of medicine that Wade gets good and squeamish over. Boris Karloff plays John Grey in the title role of The Body Snatcher. He has a hold over Daniell and Karloff is not real particular where and how he gets his corpses.Playing Daniell's servant in a supporting role and not getting as much screen time as Karloff and Daniell is Bela Lugosi. I'm not sure why he took a supporting part here, he certainly is not called on for his usual bag of ghoulish tricks. Still it's nice to see him with Karloff and Daniell in what is their picture.Val Lewton did a fabulous job in creating the mood and tone of the underside of 19th century Edinburgh. This one is a must for fans of the principal players.

A bunch of apes find a black monolith and start to evolve slowly. Then it cuts to 2001. A black monolith has been discovered on the moon--buried. When the light hits the monolith it starts to emit a message to the moons of Jupiter. Astronauts David Bowman (Keir Dullea), Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood) and some other astronauts (in suspended animation) are sent to Jupiter to investigate. However their computer HAL (with the creepy voice of Douglas Rain) goes crazy and kills everybody except for Dullea. Dullea gets to Jupiter and enters a black monolith floating in space. He's then in a room being watched over by alien beings. He ages rapidly and dies...but becomes a star child. It seems he has been chosen (for whatever reason) to show the next step in evolution to man. Basically the monolith is a gift from some alien beings who watch over the entire universe. They helped the human race evolve. The monolith on the moon was buried so man would dig it up. When they got to it the signal sent to Jupiter was to alert the aliens that man was ready for his next step.That's MY view of it. Everybody has different interpretations of this movie.I have vague recollections of seeing this back in 1968 at the age of 6 (the film is G rated). I remember the apes at the beginning scaring me...and then falling asleep. Since then I've seen it multiple times at revival theatres and, on one occasion, saw a brand new print with stereo at a play house. Yes--the special effects are impressive. Yes--the music is great. But the movie is long, far too slow and just boring! It moves at such a slow pace that it's sleep-inducing. There's very little dialogue but that's a blessing because what there is is pretty lousy. The human characters have no personality whatsoever and speak in monotones and simple short sentences. Lockwood and Dullea are supposedly buddies but I never got the feeling that they even liked each other! This isn't anything against either actor--these poor guys are given nothing to work with. For instance when HAL kills Lockwood and the other astronauts what's Dullea's reaction? Nothing. He barely raises an eyebrow. I don't blame Dullea--I think he was just playing it like director Stanley Kubrick told him. How can you care about characters who are given no personality or motivations? You know there's a problem when HAL comes across as more real than Poole and Bowman! Also HAL gets paranoid and kills Frank. Could someone please tell me how a COMPUTER gets paranoid???? They give an explanation (sort of) in 2010 but it was pretty stupid. There are a few good things about this. Douglas Rains' voice of HAL is suitably creepy. Lockwood strips down to his shorts at one point showing his muscular body. The entrance into the star gate is still impressive (if far too long).People seem to forget that a lot of people hated this movie when it first came out. MGM executives thought they had a disaster on their hands and most people couldn't make heads or tales out of the plot. During a break in a premiere screening for studio executives someone said, Something better happen in the second half or we're dead! But, inexplicably, audiences seemed to love it and it's now regarded as a masterpiece. Aside from being thoroughly bored by it I find it cold and impersonal too. The message seems to be that man is an insignificant little thing in the universe. It's all in the hands of these gods and you can't do anything to change it. That's a pretty creepy message but the movie drags out everything to a ridiculous degree. Boring, slow and sleep-inducing. The 2 is for the special effects and Dullea and Lockwood (I like both actors despite this movie).

Some of the redux additions are great, whilst there are some very cringe worthy new scenes. The addition of the Playboy bunnies scene at the abandoned medical camp is useless. It adds nothing to anything, and almost completely destroys the wonderful mood set up by the film entirely. Another useless input is the French plantation sequence. Not that bad if you think about it, but half an hour crapping on about the French position on the war is ridiculous. Cut in half, then squeezed further, it may have worked. But it does a similar job of letting the films atmosphere slip at an important moment.Despite some shaky scenes, and the useless crap shoved in by Cuppola for the redux version, Apocalypse Now delivers on every front.

If you ask me, the franchise had really been limping along with Moore's later Bond films, and unfortunately, like Connery, he certainly didn't go out with a bang. However, The Living Daylights, the first one starring Dalton, of two, isn't the best, but the franchise still showed what was probably its best film in a while.At a concert hall in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia, James Bond and his ally, Saunders, are on a mission to help Soviet General Georgi Koskov defect. After they leave this concert hall, shortly before the end of the show, they search for an assassin who will attempt to kill Koskov outside the building. They notice a sniper up high on the other side of the street who happens to be a cellist named Kara Milovy! Bond aims to kill her, but going by his instincts, he feels she's not a professional, and decides to deliberately miss and just scare her off. From there, Bond continues his mission, trying to solve the mystery of why the cello player would attempt to kill Koskov. He ends up in more than one part of the world, once again finding himself in danger a number of times, in a number of places, as he faces his enemies! The pre-opening theme sequence of this movie is not one to forget, and after that, Bond and Saunders on their mission in the dark of the night can be quite thrilling. Other suspenseful highlights in the film include the chase through the snow (and on ice-covered water), and some airplane scenes towards the end. The suspense isn't as consistent as it is in certain other Bond films, but there is enough of it to make it work for the most part. There may not be as much humour here as there is in some of this film's predecessors, and Timothy Dalton shows a bit of a change in Bond after Roger Moore, making the character a bit more serious, but I still found some humour in this film. For instance, the scene where Koskov is about to be sent through an oil pipeline, and is told it hasn't been done before. So, this movie does have occasional humour to add to the entertainment value which is mostly provided by the excitement.The merits of The Living Daylights are certainly not enough to make it the greatest Bond film ever made, and some fans obviously don't like it, but in my opinion, it's a reasonably satisfying installment overall. It still has enough to make it superior to Moore's later films in the franchise (his last couple are almost frustratingly tedious if you ask me).

Paul becomes close friends with an abused neighbor named Sam (Kristy Swanson) and a neighborhood teen named Tom (Michael Sharrett). Both kids are impressive with Paul's robot named BB (Voiced by Charles Fletcher). Paul's life turns upside down, when BB got destroyed by a paranoid old lady (Anne Rasmey) and Sam's father (Richard Marcus) accidentally killed his daughter by pushing her down the stairs. When the doctors can't save Sam. Paul decides to save Sam by using Artificial Intelligence Marco-chip brain from BB to put on Sam's brain. Which the operation turns out to be a success but Sam also shares the memories of BB. Now both minds are going to have their personal revenge.Directed by Wes Craven (Scream Trilogy, Music of the Heart, Red Eye) made an entertaining although very flawed horror film. Which is based on a novel by Diana Henstell titled Friend. Reportely director Craven and Oscar-Winning screenwriterBruce Joel Rubin (Ghost, Jacob's Ladder, My Life) were unhappy with the final product of the feature. Craven said that the studio wanted to be more like A Nightmare on Elm Street type scares. Which Craven wanted to do something completely different. Only actress Swanson is somewhat proud of the feature, especially in the infamous sequence... where she's beheaded her nasty neighbor with a Basketball! DVD has an fine anamorphic Widescreen (1.851) transfer and an decent Dolby 2.0 Mono Sound. DVD's only special feature is the original theatrical trailer. Deadly Friend is actually one of the few movies of Craven that actually offers more Heart than expected. What nearly ruined the impact of the picture is the silly, outrageous conclusion.

It's also one of the shortest but there is a good reason for that. This had to be a cheap and fast production in order to compensate for the the loses long featured Disney animated movies Pinocchio and Fantasia made on their first release. It still is the cheapest full length Disney animated movie till date and it probably is also the shortest. The movie did became a success by the way at the box offices and it gained more money than both Pinocchio and Fantasia combined.It's also the first and only Disney movie that has a main character who doesn't say a word throughout the story. Nevertheless the Dumbo character really comes to life, thanks to the talent of the animators. He's an adorable and classic Disney character, with his trademark big ears and cute big blue eyes.But despite the fact that the movie is quite short (just over one hour), the movie doesn't really feel as if it's much shorter than any other Disney movie. It perhaps even feels a bit overlong. for I feel that Dumbo is a bit of a lacking movie that restrains itself too much to one location and too much on just a couple of characters. Disney movies are always filled with some really colorful and entertaining characters. Dumbo is also filled with that but most other character roles within this movie, besides Dumbo himself and Timothy, are not featured really prominently and they just randomly pop-up into the movie and are gone again. For example the crows. They are real classics but for how long are they actually in the movie? 3 minutes maybe?The story also feels really quite restrained and it's simplistic. Just think about it, what exactly is the main plot-line of this movie? Probably about Dumbo being accepted by the crowd and the other animals for what he is but this is quite thin really. When you now days come up with a story like this it goes straight into the garbage-can in the studio's executive office. It's the foremost reason why I don't enjoy watching this movie as much as any other Disney movie from around the same time period.

Upon first viewing SEVEN SAMURAI I have to agree with many by saying that Kurosawa is simply a masterful storyteller.First off, let's clear the air here the picture is in black-and-white and it's not very 'stylish' by today's standards. It is for these reasons that many people seem to pass this movie over. However, after seeing it for myself, I must say that those aforementioned reasons should serve as NO deterrent to film enthusiasts anywhere.The story itself is brilliant in its simplicity. There are three well-known main parts to the movie, namely the search, the training and preparation, and the standoff. The movie itself is about 210 minutes long, which allows Kurosawa to fully develop three of the samurai to the point where the viewer begins to care rather deeply for them. One of the other samurai is somewhat 'half-developed', while the other three are relatively under-developed, but still possess more character than many of the so-called stars of today's 'blockbusters'.I'll admit, 210 minutes is quite a long time to watch a movie. The film even has an intermission (about 5 minutes long) after the first 130 minutes or so, but the intermission itself serves as a nuisance rather than a relief. Reason being this movie is extremely engrossing, and the time just flies by.The samurai themselves cannot be seen as generic hero types, but possess an array of 'anti-heroic' qualities. Indeed, most (if not all) of the samurai have some sort of character or personality flaw that allows the viewer to relate to them more.Many of the scenes in this film consist of epic, ground-breaking (at that time) shots. The battles are well-thought and very well-choreographed. The strategies used by both parties are intelligent and genuine. I especially liked the way that Kurosawa attempts to capture all seven samurai in the same shot, and this is evident in the epic final scene.This movie is definitely one for the ages, and belongs up there with the likes of CITIZEN KANE. As evidenced by literature, it would seem that fine storytelling indeed withstands the test of time. This film is a true classic in very sense. A fine and epic motion picture.It is difficult to give this film 4 stars (out of 4) simply because I can't recommend it to everyone.

It is not a drama, a romance, an action flick, or a story of redemption. What makes it so difficult to gauge is that it does not slip easily into one film genre or another. Perhaps that is why I see more threads about Fargo devoted to why this movie rocks or why it sucks than to any other movie. Some people go into it expecting a comedy and are disappointed. Others go in expecting a riveting thriller and also exit displeased. Those who go into this film simply expecting a great movie, however, will leave having watched one of the greatest pieces of art offered in the 1990's.I generally (but not always) agree with Roger Ebert's reviews and never more so than with his recap of the Coen Brothers' first true masterpiece, Fargo. He says that the movie covered a variety of genres before ultimately emerging as one of the greatest films he'd ever seen. I would have to agree. After being encouraged by a friend to see this movie, I saw it not knowing exactly what to expect. I laughed, I was tense, I sat on the edge of my seat, and I finally ended up rooted to my seat, stunned, as the closing credits rolled. I have not seen The English Patient, the Best Picture winner of 1996, but I doubt it came close to Fargo in cinematic greatness. Please correct me if I am wrong, but it seems to me unlikely that any film of 1996 could have been more original and astounding than Fargo was.The driving force behind this film is the script. It is at once funny and haunting, set up by a proclamation that the story is based on true events (not true). As these words appear at the start of the film, followed by the opening scene, you can already see that Fargo is not your run-of-the-mill flick; it is unique. The script is full of twists and turns; I will not spoil them here but suffice to say that a cop pulling over two attempted kidnappers turns a somewhat strange situation into absolute bedlam.The somewhat strange situation is that Jerry Lundegard (William H. Macy in an Oscar nominated role) has paid to have his wife kidnapped by two lumbering criminals (Peter Stormare and Steve Buscemi in his best role to date) in order to garner a large ransom from his wealthy father-in-law. Of course, this ludicrous plan goes horribly awry, and the policeman scene mentioned earlier sets off a chain of events that leads to numerous killings. Eventually, the heroine, Police Chief Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand in an Oscar winning role), arrives on the scene to deduce what has happened.Fargo never lets up for a second. It draws you in from the first scene and yanks you from side to side during its 98 minute running time. The dialogue is pitch perfect, as the Coen Brothers capture their native North Dakotan dialect to a tee, and the script flows seamlessly from one scene to the next. The movie is entertaining from the start but really hits its stride when Marge enters the scene. Three great actors- McDormand, Macy, and Buscemi- are all truly at the top of their form in this film.Fargo is unlike any movie around. It is a comedy, but it is also a thriller. It is an action movie, but it is also a slow-paced, methodical movie. It rolls a bunch of genres into one.

This platinum edition features an excellent digital restoration, a number of excellent documentaries, games, a visit with Rocky the Rhino, who found his way to the cutting room floor, and plenty of other extras. There's also a passable Jonas Brothers cover of Louis Prima's I Wan'na Be Like You that's sure to attract the attention of pre-teen girls the world over. This particular DVD is also a Disney Movie Rewards disc, meaning that you can gain points for purchasing it. While some squabble over the aspect ratio of the film, I think that the story, music, and characters are far too valuable to pass up because of this. If you don't own The Jungle Book and consider yourself a Disney fan, make sure you buy this disc before Disney takes it away again. Highly recommended.

Murray owns the screen from beginning to end of this marvelous film, and I mean he owns it. Obviously the Academy Awards don't actually care about honoring great film, regardless of genre, because this is clearly one of the best films of 1993, the 1990's as a whole, and also of all time.Murray plays Phil Connors, a cynical weatherman sent to cover the Groundhog Day festivities in Punxsatawney, Pennsylvania. His one-day trip turns into a never-ending cycle, as Phil gets caught in a time warp that causes him to relive the same day over and over again. Phil is stuck in Punxsatawney for a seemingly endless amount of time; each day, he wakes up in the same Bed and Breakfast and nobody else remembers a thing about all the days he's lived. We follow Phil through several emotional stages, ranging from confusion to terror to joy to despair and ultimately to real happiness.Groundhog Day is one of the most original comedies I've ever seen. The plot has been repeated on television shows several times since (and perhaps the idea had been filmed beforehand, I'm not sure), but never has it been as perfectly crafted as it is here. Groundhog Day is both funny and realistic, (as realistic as a time-warp movie can be) and Bill Murray is perfect in the lead role. Andie McDowell is also very good as Rita, Phil's co-worker and eventual love interest.Groundhog Day is essentially a comedy, but it is also deeply thought-provoking, and makes you consider how you live your life. Phil starts out as a selfish, cynical man and slowly changes into a considerate, helpful individual who truly cares about others. As we watch him transform into a better person, we laugh a whole lot at the situations he gets into- but we hopefully emerge from it all like him, a changed man for the better. Groundhog Day is a brilliant piece of film-making and should be watched by everybody (preferably every Groundhog Day, which is February 2nd).

Michael again pursues his niece Jamie (Harris), who is left mute and under psychiatric care after the events of the last film. Dr. Loomis (Pleasence) has plans of his own and in an effort to use Jamie as bait, probably destroys the last shred of sanity he has left.Halloween 5 The Revenge Of Michael Myers suffers from a severe case of sequelitis. Not to say that it isn't a good enough film, because it definitely has some good things going for it, but this is surely where the franchise started to get messy. We are introduced to a mysterious figure, known at the time as the Man in Black, who shares an identical tattoo with Myers, leading into quite possibly one of the worst plot devices in the next film. Aside from that, director Dominique Othenin-Girard takes the series into territory it doesn't belong. In this film, Michael resembles some of the more faceless killers of the 80's, as he stalks horny teenagers in a barn scene that is extremely derivative of the Friday the 13th series and seems as if he's willing to kill anyone he sees, even if they don't get in his way. Another problem here is we see a certain beloved character get the axe, while the characters who take their place have absolutely no exposition, nor any likable features. Tina (Wendy Kaplan) is one character in particular who is likely to give you a splitting headache before it's all over. Other nit-picky things -- like the horrible mask, wrestler-sized Michael Myers and mansion-esquire Myers house -- I'll overlook for the sake of not complaining too much. In all honesty, Halloween 5 is still a decent flick, and probably the last truly enjoyable entry in the series. Othenin-Girard, despite not knowing what to do with the story, does put on a better show than is expected, with some striking visuals and a few, truly suspenseful scenes (all about the laundry chute!) to counter the more cheesy, slasher clichés on display. Danielle Harris is great again as Jamie Lloyd, and despite reportedly being at odds with the director, Donald Pleasence turns in an excellent performance, with some of his most memorable lines in the series. Halloween 5 makes a nice companion piece to Halloween 4 and you should enjoy it while you can, because six years later, things got messy and the story started to unravel. Badly. Final word is that despite it's slasher-syndrome, The Revenge Of Michael Myers is still a worthy entry into the series that is a little hard not to enjoy, despite it's flaws.

He apparently does and, along with childhood pal Matt Damon, in Good Will Hunting, he has penned a nearly perfect script. Good Will Hunting will make you laugh and make you cry. It will make you angry and sad and happy and excited all at once. It makes you root for its protagonist one moment and then hate him for being so stubborn the next. In short, it is one of the most powerful screenplays ever written.Besides the writing, it is also perfectly acted. Ben Affleck is fantastic as Will Hunting's best friend and deserved an Oscar nomination simply for the scene in which he tells Will that he wishes Will would one day simply not be at his house. While Affleck is great in a relatively small role, however, it is Damon and Robin Williams who steal the show as the titular character and his psychologist, respectively. Damon's Will Hunting is just about the smartest man in the world, a man who can solve the most difficult calculus problem in his head and can read a book in a matter of minutes. Despite his genius, he is deeply emotionally troubled, due to his upbringing on the rough streets of Boston. Williams won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his brilliant portrayal of the only man who was able to get under Will's skin.The movie, as stated above, makes you feel a wide span of emotions. Will is such a complex character that we cannot ever fully understand what makes him tick. Sometimes, we feel like he is growing emotionally, and sometimes we just can't grasp why he is being so stubborn and immature. The movie flows beautifully from one scene to the next and only seems to get better as it progresses. Also, it stands up wonderfully upon multiple viewings.Good Will Hunting was nominated for nine Academy Awards in 1997 but only came away with two wins, Robin Williams for Best Supporting Actor and Damon and Affleck for Best Original Screenplay. I have seen all five films nominated for Best Picture that year, and this film is far and away the best of them. Titanic is a very good movie and certainly groundbreaking in terms of visual effects, but it comes nowhere close to making the emotional impact that this film makes. Also, Matt Damon was absolutely robbed of an Oscar for Best Actor by Jack Nicholson (As Good as it Gets).Simply put, Good Will Hunting is one of the best films of the 1990's and one of my personal favorites of all time. I have handed out only 20 ratings of perfect 10's on IMDb out of over 600 films that I've rated.

Why is that ? Give me the honor.._True that (Ken Finkleman) as a writer and director made a fine effort to track down the splendid quality of comedy that the original movie brought, but when it comes to the direction some of the vitality was lost. Of course the cartoonish sense, the literal-visual jokes, the parodied movies, the absurd dialog are already here, but not wholly effective as independent, and less powerful compared to the first (Airplane !)._The reoccurrence !, it comes here with so many types. The repetitive plot, relationships, and reactions. The repetitive kind of jokes from the first movie (people get bored out of Striker's story, drunken McCroskey, panicked fighting passengers,.. etc).

(David Zucker, Jerry Zucker, Jim Abrahams) are the ones whom made a personality for the parody movie in the American cinema since their hit (Airplane) which got an Arabic commercial title in Egypt when it first came out stands for (Insane People above the Air).

Makes me suspect, could (Ken Finkleman) be an alias for the triple team of parody ?, maybe they had disagreement with the production company (or themselves) to go for the (Alan Smithee) solution and replace their names with another one on their unsatisfying work ?! As you see the status of the movie makes me think that way.Apparently it's not (Airplane II The Sequel), it's (Airplane.. Again !).. and that, apart, is low point, so how about more defects.
