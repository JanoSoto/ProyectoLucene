Some people will agree, some people won't. I have to say I loved this movie. This movie put Geoffrey Rush on my list of all time favorite actors. House on Haunted Hill is a loose remake of the 1958 HOHH, directed by William Castle and starring the great Vincent Price. When I first heard about the remake, and heard that Geoffrey Rush was replacing Vincent Price, I couldn't believe it. Having seen the original, and being a huge fan of Vincent Price, I didn't think I would like this movie at all, but I loved it. One of the best things about it is the fact that they made the movie somewhat original. Instead of a shot for shot remake (i.e Psycho, which was terrible) they took a different turn, gave it a somewhat different plot, and made the house actually haunted(or is it?). Geoffrey Rush is fantastic. I saw him in Elizabeth and Les Miserables after I saw this movie, and couldn't believe it was the same person. He looks like Vincent Price, he steals the scenes like Vincent Price, but He doesn't IMITATE Vincent Price, which would have been easy to do. In the original, Vincent Price played the role very elegant and classy, while Geoffrey Rush plays him more seedy, and kind of like a little kid doing something very naughty (and loving it!). He manages to do exactly what Vincent Price did in the original. He makes you like the role in the first few minutes you see him. I also can't forget the performances of Famke Janssen, Taye Diggs, Ali Larter, Bridgette Wilson, Peter Gallagher, and Chris Kattan. They were also equally great in their roles. One thing that does upset me is the constant slams about the computer graphics. While they were not the best, I found them somewhat believable. SpoilerIf I worried about how the computer effects looked in every movie I saw, then portions of Jurassic Park 1 and 2, Titanic, Deep Blue Sea, and lots of other movies would not have impressed me as much as they did. While a collage of smoky ghosts chasing the surviving members of the cast around isn't the most scary thing in the world, what else could they have done? Dressed up a member of the Crew in a white sheet and had him walk around yelling Boo? This movie is definitely a must see. Rent it today! I give it a Ten out of Ten.

I thought it was cool. I'm 24 now and I see this movie in a completely different light. I don't doubt that the movie has amazing special effects that makes the movie quite watchable if you just want to vegatate for a couple of hours. I don't doubt that there  might be a few plot holes and discontinuity in the time travel aspect of the story. This is something I have yet to figure out.   But after watching this movie a few times and reading critical reviews of the movie, I've come to this current opinion. If you bother to think about this movie beyond the great special effects, you might find that it has more to offer than the cool F\/X. James Cameron is a very critical and detail oriented director. If you are familiar with his work at all, you will see an emerging theme in all of his movies. I believe that theme is humanity vs. technology. (THE ABYSS, TITANIC, ALIENS) In any case, the characters are an INTEGRAL part of the story and not simply the platform in which the action takes place. Compare this movie to say, practically any Jerry Bruckheimer movie. (Gone in Sixty Seconds anyone?) James Cameron thinks about his characters first before he can imagine the situation in which they may reasonably be confronted with. James Cameron says himself that the intent of the movie was to make people feel for a robot, to cry for him, and not simply to be blown away by the action taking place within the context of the characters and the story.With this in mind, I see this movie as first and foremost, a human story. The whole premise of this story is the fight for humankind. Humans vs. Machines. I mentioned Cameron's theme earlier humanity vs. technology. In this movie, the more technologically advanced we become, the more inhuman we are. Witness this as Sarah Conner becomes more of a terminator herself in her willingness to kill Miles Dyson. She does not question morally or ethically about why she is killing him. She is just going to do it. Before she does it though, she has an epiphany and she realizes exactly what she has become. It is shattering to her. There is such a moral fabric throughout this story voiced by our future hero You can't kill people!!! And later on, Don't you get it?! Don't you understand why you can't kill people? Because we hurt, we feel pain, we're afraid... It is not surprising that John has such a strong moral fabric. After all, he is going to become a great leader someday. Ironically, it is his teachings to the terminator and the resetting of the CPU that makes the terminator more human. In the end, he becomes half-human and he realizes his half-humanity. I know now why you cry... but it is something that I can never do. It makes his sacrifice even more greater. A hero is defined as someone who sacrifices himself for a greater good, something greater than even his own existence. Although the terminator could have stayed, he chose to go. In this movie, he is a true hero. Cameron chose to have this strong moral issue in the film... he did not want Arnold as the good robot killing everything in his way- which he could have easily done. After all, he is a terminator. He chose to weave this moral fabric into the story which I think many people easily overlook. The terminator teaches us a lot about ourselves too. This is a very spiritual aspect of the film. John says to the terminator, we're not going to make it, are me? People, I mean... to which the terminator replies, It is in your nature to destroy yourselves....   It makes the theme and message of the whole movie even more meaningful. The theme of the movie can best be summed up by Sarah Conner, If a machine,a terminator, can learn the value of human life, maybe we can too. It took something as inhuman as the terminator to teach us something very human about ourselves loyalty, love, fear, sacrifice, and hope. So before you write T2 off as just another action movie, I challenge you to watch it critically. This movie is about destiny vs. free will, (how much control over our future do we have? as john says, there is no fate but what we make of it ourselves.) and as I've said before, really about being human in such a technologically run world. Watch as Sarah fights to protect her son, watch as john just desperately wants his mother to embrace him and love him. Observe the quiet moments of contemplation and rest in this movie. This movie is not perfect as no movie is but as an action movie, it certainly provides a lot more than a two hour adrenaline rush.

It is a unique cinematic moment, one that lingers for several unsettling minutes.The remainder of the film is as powerful, hypnotic and ironic as the image which precedes the two-plus hours of drama and musical.Dancer In The Dark follows Selma (Bjork -- in her feature film acting debut), a musical dancer whose eye-blindness is worsening by the day. Her slow descent into visual darkness is accompanied by a slide into the enveloping moral darkness of the all-sighted people around her.Selma can see the world beyond her and around her, but cannot see the world right before her -- in both an optical and symbolic sense. She is trapped, confined by the contradictions of those who seek her solace and comfort. She is manipulated and framed by someone she confides in.  When the moment arrives Selma is so loyal to a fault to this particular person that she risks her future in order to stay true to herself. What keeps Selma going is her desire to see life in refreshing, vibrant colors -- in other words, via the rose-colored lenses of the idealistic world that she believes exists. The musical aspect of Dancer In The Dark comes on slowly but is rich and alive -- in sharper focus and clarity than the heretofore Dogma95 von Trier trademarks the drab color, natural light and  high-speed edits and camera movement which compose much of this film. Selma could be living in the musical world and dreaming in the drab, reality world she is caught in. Or it could be the other way round. The musical world represents a naivete, a fantasy, an innocence and purity through which Selma lives out her fantasies and desires. She dances in the mind, in the heart and most of all, in the dark. Aspects of this drama\/musical are disturbing, not just because of Selma's circumstances, but because she has a pure heart and trustworthy soul, a soul whose foundation is battered but not defeated. Her son, who also has problems seeing things clearly, proves to be the treasured being whom Selma works so hard for. Selma shields her son from the harshness and indignitiesof the real world and what she does for him is done in the hope that he can see the same world she sees through even clearer eyes than her own.The film's visual style is arresting and like all Dogma95 films -- disjointed, full of random imagery. The editing style is effective, adding atmosphere and an authentic feel to the characters. There are two memorable sequences in Dancer In The Dark, one which follows the film's critical event. The balletic camera work and characters' choreography in thisparticular sequence has as much to do with the strength of Selma's vision and her fairytale notions about the world's machinations as the images themselves do. Lars von Trier's film parallels several moments in the 1999 film The Green Mile and it is interesting to note that actor David Morse plays as prominent a role in Dancer as he did in Mile, though certainly for different reasons. Catherine Deneuve gives von Trier's film great weight and dignity  in her role as Kathy, a character who believes she has Selma's best interests at heart. Joel Grey has an impacting cameo in a pivotal scene, while Peter Stormare is endearing as Jeff, a Sling Blade-type guardian angel who wants to make Selma happier than she insists she is.Stellan Skarsgaard makes a cameo appearance as a doctor. Most of all though, it is Bjork, who shines with an acting depth that deservedly won her Best Actress honors at the Cannes Film Festival last May. Bjork should be seriously considered for an Oscar nomination in 2001. The Icelandic pop sensation is central to scenes resembling the visual creativity she brings to her own music videos. Bjork also wrote the songs and musical score for Dancer In The Dark, a film that intrigues, moves, disturbs and impacts in many other emotional and psychological ways.

Her son, who also has problems seeing things clearly, proves to be the treasured being whom Selma works so hard for. Selma shields her son from the harshness and indignitiesof the real world and what she does for him is done in the hope that he can see the same world she sees through even clearer eyes than her own.The film's visual style is arresting and like all Dogma95 films -- disjointed, full of random imagery. The editing style is effective, adding atmosphere and an authentic feel to the characters. There are two memorable sequences in Dancer In The Dark, one which follows the film's critical event. The balletic camera work and characters' choreography in thisparticular sequence has as much to do with the strength of Selma's vision and her fairytale notions about the world's machinations as the images themselves do. Lars von Trier's film parallels several moments in the 1999 film The Green Mile and it is interesting to note that actor David Morse plays as prominent a role in Dancer as he did in Mile, though certainly for different reasons. Catherine Deneuve gives von Trier's film great weight and dignity  in her role as Kathy, a character who believes she has Selma's best interests at heart. Joel Grey has an impacting cameo in a pivotal scene, while Peter Stormare is endearing as Jeff, a Sling Blade-type guardian angel who wants to make Selma happier than she insists she is.Stellan Skarsgaard makes a cameo appearance as a doctor. Most of all though, it is Bjork, who shines with an acting depth that deservedly won her Best Actress honors at the Cannes Film Festival last May. Bjork should be seriously considered for an Oscar nomination in 2001. The Icelandic pop sensation is central to scenes resembling the visual creativity she brings to her own music videos. Bjork also wrote the songs and musical score for Dancer In The Dark, a film that intrigues, moves, disturbs and impacts in many other emotional and psychological ways. ","genre":"Crime, Drama, Musical"},{"date":"24 September 2000","score":"","review":"  \t Lars von Trier's new film begins with a Rorshach-like ink-blot test image that evolves into many things and nothing -- at the same time. It is a unique cinematic moment, one that lingers for several unsettling minutes.The remainder of the film is as powerful, hypnotic and ironic as the image which precedes the two-plus hours of drama and musical.Dancer In The Dark follows Selma (Bjork -- in her feature film acting debut), a musical dancer whose eye-blindness is worsening by the day. Her slow descent into visual darkness is accompanied by a slide into the enveloping moral darkness of the all-sighted people around her.Selma can see the world beyond her and around her, but cannot see the world right before her -- in both an optical and symbolic sense. She is trapped, confined by the contradictions of those who seek her solace and comfort. She is manipulated and framed by someone she confides in.  When the moment arrives Selma is so loyal to a fault to this particular person that she risks her future in order to stay true to herself. What keeps Selma going is her desire to see life in refreshing, vibrant colors -- in other words, via the rose-colored lenses of the idealistic world that she believes exists. The musical aspect of Dancer In The Dark comes on slowly but is rich and alive -- in sharper focus and clarity than the heretofore Dogma95 von Trier trademarks the drab color, natural light and  high-speed edits and camera movement which compose much of this film. Selma could be living in the musical world and dreaming in the drab, reality world she is caught in. Or it could be the other way round. The musical world represents a naivete, a fantasy, an innocence and purity through which Selma lives out her fantasies and desires. She dances in the mind, in the heart and most of all, in the dark. Aspects of this drama\/musical are disturbing, not just because of Selma's circumstances, but because she has a pure heart and trustworthy soul, a soul whose foundation is battered but not defeated.

That perhaps his treatment by Hollywood studios had made him think that he would make the most un-Hollywood film ever. Timecode is made on digital video with four different cameras filming at exactly the same time and the screen is split four ways so you see all four stories unedited at the same time.  But there is method in his madness, Not only did I genuinely enjoy it but on second viewing it was even better.It might seem headache inducing watching four screens at the same time but the sound is muted on the quadrants you can safely ignore and turned up on the quadrant you're meant to concentrate on. So you can simply follow the quadrant with the higher sound level and ignore what's happening elsewhere. But where's the fun in that?The film works on two levels.  Firstly there is the astonishing technical achievement.  The manoeuvrability and quality of digital video on display has ramifications for the whole industry. The precise timing meaning earthquakes happen at the same time (well, one camera were half a second out once but that's perhaps being too picky). There is also the way characters can be in two quadrants at the same time, the changeover in the screening room being particular neat.The second level the film works is the story.  It has been said that the story is almost incidental but I have to disagree.  Although it is slight, there is a story with a beginning, middle and end.  What makes it successful for me are the connections and characterisations. That's what happens when the actors run through the whole movie 15 times - by the last time the characters are nailed and totally believable.  Although I want to, I'll resist singling out any actors. All 27 have to do an amazing job, improvising  *and* staying within rigid set parameters.  And this is accomplished with wit and aplomb.It rewards a second viewing at least.  Although it will surely come into its own on DVD when you can choose which picture to concentrate on rather than letting the director choose. While those expecting Time Cop will be disappointed, this is a must-see for anyone interested in cinema.

Now...I find that kind of strange since I'd be hard for a human being to survive that. But don't you remember that Michael was blinded at the end of part 2? And all of a sudden, he can see?Anyways getting back to it, Mikey has been in a max-security prison for the last ten years. But since he's in a coma and he obviously isn't waking up any time soon **wink, wink**...they decide hey let's move him to the same institution that he escaped from on this very night ten years ago...he isn't going to do anything.In real life, they'd probably be right. In a horror movie...bwahaha...idiots. Michael escapes and goes on another killing spree, stomping a B-line to Haddonfield, this time in pursuit of his cute lil' niece Jamie. It seems that Laurie Strode has tragically died, along with her husband, in a car accident about a year prior to the events in this film. Jamie is all alone in the world, being taken care of by her new foster family, including the lead in the film, Jamie's foster sister Rachael.Nice set-up, eh? Did I also mention Loomis is back in what may be his best performance in the Halloween series yet? Loomis is heavily involved in the beggining of the movie, but by the end he's almost non-existent. I think the flaws in this movie were not from the script, though it wasn't perfect.One was the acting. Danielle Harris was okay, Donald Pleasence was great, and Beau Star was passable, but everything else sucked. Didn't the Rachael\/Kelly\/Brady love triangle simply stink of 80s television?Another was that I didn't care for Dwight Little's style. He didn't capture the same dark feel that Carpenter and Rosenthal did, except for a few parts. Also it moves even slower than the first Halloween does and in effect, is less interesting. I also didn't like how Michael Myers was likened to Jason in this movie. Michael doesn't crush head. Jason does that. Michael doesn't stay standing after being shot the crap out of with assault rifles. Jason does that. See what I mean? Michael lost his scariness because he was simply too damn powerful.

Every fool is looking for a leader to lead him to a target. And do them destroy the world! So simple, so briliant idea. And produce chaos!Of course, if you don't agree with that extreme idea, there are many many ohter things to make you lave this movie.

This movie has been touted as `the best reviewed film so far this year' (which, in a lackluster year of movies really isn't saying much).  Don't be fooled--this movie isn't a coming of age tale-it's a two hour episode of Behind the Music that isn't nearly as exciting as what VH-1 can put together.Rumor has it that Cameron Crowe has been trying to get his &#145;story' made for years now, and after watching what the story is, I can see why.  It starts out fairly well, but once William hooks up with Stillwater it gets flat out boring.  Every scene seems to drag on forever, and the movie simply does not move along well.  There is virtually no character development, no explanation as to why Stillwater and the groupies would want to hang out with this total dork who doesn't have a clue about anything.  Therefore, the characters were extremely one dimensional, very surface level stereotypes of rock stars and groupies.  Nothing new going on here.  The lowest point of the movie for me was the group singalong to &#145;Tiny Dancer.'  Sorry Cameron, P.T. Anderson can pull it off.  You can't.  The climax (if you want to call it that) is virtually nonexistent, a faint blip in what is already a very dull movie.  Add to that extremely cheesy dialogue (I can already see that `I need to go home.'  `You're already home.' Will be the next `You complete me.'  Cringeworthy, definitely), and you've got a nothing special film here.Frances McDormand and Philip Seymour Hoffman steal the show in the scenes that they are in, perhaps the only saving grace of this movie for me. Billy Crudup and Jason Lee do a good job as well.  I had a problem with Kate Hudson (can you say bland?) and Patrick Fugit.  He looks like a deer in headlights during the entire movie, and his dopey smile gets quite annoying.Personally, you couldn't pay me to sit through this movie again.  But, since so many people seem to love it, you should probably go see it and decide for yourself if you like it or not.

I'd be hard pressed to say that I actually *disliked* Nosferatu it is littered with haunting images of unforgettable power and beauty (strange beauty, eerie beauty), and its use of music is truly inspired. However, much like Kubrick in his later years, Herzog is a director who focuses so much painstaking detail on individual shot compositions that he loses sight of how to move a story along or keep it fluid and interesting. The characters, too, never take on any real life or identity - all seem to be sleep-walking through the picture in frozen poses. This is not entirely inappropriate, of course, to a film about the living dead, and adds immeasurably to the film's haunting quality. But it leaves the movie without any real center of focus or identity.The film is ultimately an enigma. It doesn't really engage the mind or the heart (and is certainly not scary) but on a purely sensual level it does get under your skin. See it for its remarkable images and ability to invoke creepiness and dread, but expect little else. Also, I found it to be more powerful taken in small doses, a little at a time - that way, you are free to wonder afresh at each new directorial flourish, without noticing so much the snail's pace or the indifferent storytelling (I must admit to dozing off on more than one occasion when I attempted to watch it straight through). The ending was particularly disappointing; primed for a battle of wits between the heroine and the vampire, all that one gets is a prolonged suck-and-claw sequence which holds little power or surprise.Having never seen the 1921 Murnau original, I can make no claim either way as to the film's faithfulness, but it certainly adds nothing significant to vampire lore. In other words, there's no new twists or wrinkles here for anyone already familiar with the Dracula story. I would, however, add this to that rare list of films whose visual power is so great that it may be worth putting aside one's reservations about the appeal of its story (other films in this category for me include Blade Runner, Brazil, Apocalypse Now and, to a lesser extent, Tim Burton's original Batman). You'll have to judge for yourself whether you're the type of person who is willing and able to make that trade-off.ONE FINAL NOTE I saw this movie in its dubbed English version (it is also available in German with English subtitles) and I would highly recommend it. Watching foreign movies in their native tongue has its own merits, of course, and I wouldn't discourage it. But this was perhaps the best dubbing job I have ever seen, and the film loses nothing by seeing it in this way.

Also, I found it to be more powerful taken in small doses, a little at a time - that way, you are free to wonder afresh at each new directorial flourish, without noticing so much the snail's pace or the indifferent storytelling (I must admit to dozing off on more than one occasion when I attempted to watch it straight through). The ending was particularly disappointing; primed for a battle of wits between the heroine and the vampire, all that one gets is a prolonged suck-and-claw sequence which holds little power or surprise.Having never seen the 1921 Murnau original, I can make no claim either way as to the film's faithfulness, but it certainly adds nothing significant to vampire lore. In other words, there's no new twists or wrinkles here for anyone already familiar with the Dracula story. I would, however, add this to that rare list of films whose visual power is so great that it may be worth putting aside one's reservations about the appeal of its story (other films in this category for me include Blade Runner, Brazil, Apocalypse Now and, to a lesser extent, Tim Burton's original Batman). You'll have to judge for yourself whether you're the type of person who is willing and able to make that trade-off.ONE FINAL NOTE I saw this movie in its dubbed English version (it is also available in German with English subtitles) and I would highly recommend it. Watching foreign movies in their native tongue has its own merits, of course, and I wouldn't discourage it. But this was perhaps the best dubbing job I have ever seen, and the film loses nothing by seeing it in this way.

I'd be hard pressed to say that I actually *disliked* Nosferatu it is littered with haunting images of unforgettable power and beauty (strange beauty, eerie beauty), and its use of music is truly inspired. However, much like Kubrick in his later years, Herzog is a director who focuses so much painstaking detail on individual shot compositions that he loses sight of how to move a story along or keep it fluid and interesting. The characters, too, never take on any real life or identity - all seem to be sleep-walking through the picture in frozen poses. This is not entirely inappropriate, of course, to a film about the living dead, and adds immeasurably to the film's haunting quality. But it leaves the movie without any real center of focus or identity.The film is ultimately an enigma.

If you don't go to the movies just for fun, answer me what is the first name that comes to your mind when someone talks about suspense\/mystery films? FRIDAY THE 13TH? No. SCREAM? No. Wes Craven? No. John Carpenter? No. Brian De Palma? No. Of course the answer would be Alfred Hitchcock, if you really like cinema. Hitch is an unanimity today among film critics even more than 20 years after his death, something that never happened even with Kubrick and Buñuel, for example. Not every film of his is a masterpiece, but at least one is an unquestionable classic, an icon when you think about suspense films PSYCHO. It was released in 1960, shocking audiences and slowly becoming a classic. Considered by the American Film Institute the 18th best film ever and being one of the most well-known pictures of the American cinema, it was obviously ripped-off lots of times, even remade by Gus Van Sant in 1998 scene by scene. But, in opposite of what we would expect, it never became stale. It's still the same PSYCHO, an unique, chilling, spectacular work of art that entertains audiences and makes them think. A masterpiece!It's amazing how this film still remains unique 40 years after its release. Every generation enjoys it, every person who watches it for the first time has a strong opinion about it, it is always a good subject for talking. Some of the most remarkable moments of the cinema are on PSYCHO, at least one a shower scene. But first let's get back to the beginning of the story. Marion Crane works as a secretary and her boss gives her a huge amount of money to deposit. Her boyfriend has to pay some debts and they want to live together without trouble. As the smart girl she is, Marion decides to run away with the money. She knows she is doing something wrong, so she changes her car and keep going on the road. On a rainy night, she realizes that is difficult to drive more and decides to stop at a motel she doesn't know the decadent Bates Motel (12 cabins, 12 vacancies). There, Marion is received by a young man named Norman Bates, the motel owner, and checks in. He invites her to come to dinner, but Marion hears the voice of Norman's mother, who refuses to let the girl enter at her house. He takes to her a small dinner on his office and they talk a little. Norman lets to know that his mother is invalid and was involved in a tragedy on the past, and he works with dead birds. He seems to be an insecure person because of his mother attitudes. They finish to talk and Marion goes to her room in order to have a shower. That seems to be a calm place, uh? Well, Marion is taking shower and... you know what happens... Poor girl! Norman gets disturbed with the fact and hides Marion's car with her body (and the money) on the swamp. Some days later, Lila Crane, Marion's sister, and Sam Loomis, Marion's boyfriend, are searching for her. A private detective, named Arborgast, will appear to help them. The secret they will find out involving the insecure boy and his mean mother is something very, very weird.With an unusual story, Hitch made the one that is the best film of his brilliant career, along with VERTIGO. The story of PSYCHO could turn into a mess, but the screenplay is perfectly written, with all the ingredients to surprise and scare us. At the screen, what we see is even better. Not one disposable scene, great situations, involving characters. And Hitch... it is not even needed to say. Helped by a wonderful cinematography and Bernard Herrman's chilling, unforgettable score, his camera takes and the angles he uses are just brilliant! The two murder scenes are just perfect, especially the one in the shower, which I don't need to say that is one of the 3 most well-known scenes of the American cinema, and also one of the 3 best, scariest etc. Oh! And the actors! Who could think that Janet Leigh would be killed on the first half? And who could think Anthony Perkins was such a mad guy? The conclusion goes to the right way, being smart and haunting.I could write all my impressions about PSYCHO, but I don't want to take this much longer. It is one of the films that most influences the American cinema of our days. It is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. And that's it.To finish, I just wanted to make a parallel between a scene in PSYCHO and a similar one in Brian De Palma's DRESSED TO KILL, obviously influenced by it. When they sum up the crime in PSYCHO, the police officer say that Marion Crane was kind of an alert for the mother to show up into Norman Bates-- the rigid mother who wanted her son only for her. In DRESSED TO KILL (you may think I'm a perverted), Kate Miller and Liz Blake were alerts for the psychiatrist's male side to show up. He wanted to change his sex, but they were obstacles to him because he got excited with them. I don't know why I'm writing that... That's interesting, but forget!
