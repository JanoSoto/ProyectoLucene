After success on T.V. and the fiasco that was Popeye, Williams finally became a major forced to be reckoned with on the big screen with this drama filled with subtle comedy about a free-spirited man influenced by his free spirited mom who purposely seduced a dying soldier simply so she could have his child.Don't you dare say sperm in this house!, her imperious papa (Hume Cronyn in an amusing cameo) tells daughter Glenn Close, a nurse with a love of life determined to be a mother without the benefit of marriage. Why she never even met the son of a bitch, Cronyn tells wife Jessica Tandy, upset to think that she basically raped the innocent man. Mom and dad may not have understood their daughter, but her son (Williams) understands her and loves her greatly, which is proved in a tragic scene where he understands without even knowing that something horrible has just taken place. Close focuses the first part of her life on raising him with great values yet independence, then she moves on to become heavily involved in the women's movement in protest over a young woman who was raped and had her tongue cut out to keep her quiet. Her assistant is a former football player (John Lithgow) who altered his sex to live as a woman. Free-spirited Williams instantly welcomes him\/her as a close friend, a very touching gesture to see a straight man live by.Garp marries a smart woman (Mary Beth Hurt), has two children, and undergoes a series of marital issues all the while trying to fulfill his desire to fly, having learned that his late father was a pilot. Indeed, fliers are everywhere in this life, such as the metaphor of a pilot crashing into the new house Williams and Hurt have just purchased. There's a free spirited sexuality here too, with Close early on pairing her son with hooker Swoosie Kurtz just to study male sexuality and later Hurt's revenge on her philandering husband by having her own affair which leads to funny but disturbing moment where the poor young man she is involved with leads to an ironic twist of fate. The serious elements of this film outweigh the comic, however, and there are many important issues covered here in showing the desire to live one's dreams that sometimes lead to tragic consequences. When this film was first released, there were many complaints from the book readers over how the story was altered, but what ends up on screen is truly memorable. All of the performances are outstanding, with Close becoming a full fledged star as a result of this film and Lithgow moving into the realm of major star to be. Williams proved that he could be a dramatic actor of substance, and Hurt is very touching as well. With direction by the great George Roy Hill, the film has stood the test of time, and with Robin Williams' passing, is worth re-visiting to show that behind the mask of comedy is an even thicker mask of tragedy that sometimes is never revealed until it is too late.

Ironically, in the movie Popeye, Robin Williams claimed I Yam What I Yam, and in La Cage, his character's lover sang I am What I am. Also ironic is the fact that Nathan Lane's The Producers co-star Gary Beach won great acclaim on Broadway for playing the same role which Lane plays here. Years later, Harvey Fierstein (who played Williams' brother in Mrs. Doubtfire) would play the same role in the third Broadway production of La Cage.A big drag disco becomes the setting for the former La Cagelles, right off the Atlantic coast down in Miami. Williams and Lane are a married gay couple dealing with the impending wedding of their son to the daughter of an ultra conservative politician (Gene Hackman) and his all-American wife (Dianne Wiest) who have no idea that their daughter's prospective in-laws are indeed two men which would rock Hackman's world considering that he is in charge of a morality commission determined to close all gay establishments and basically the gay community as well.In addition to all this wackiness there is Hank Azaria, the feisty maid who longs to be in Williams' drag show (which stars Lane) but genuinely has no talent. Azaria brings out all his comic genius in this scene-stealing supporting part, especially when he is put in charge of redecorating the apartment in anticipation of Hackman and Wiest's arrivals. The film follows both the original French movie and the musical almost to the letter, with the presence of Christine Baranski as young Val's (Dan Futterman) real mother. Future Ally McBeal star Calista Flockhart is amusing as Hackman and Wiest's daughter who is as far removed from her parent's conservative ways as they are with the reality of changing times.Plenty of comedy ensues out of the chaos, resulting in a drag show finale that has to be seen to be believed. There's enough music here to be its own juke-box musical, especially We Are Family, the big production number for the various drag queens who provide their own share of amusement as they witness the crazy goings on around them. Wacky costumes and stylish wigs, in addition to the crazy art direction, add to the over-all direction by the legendary Mike Nichols. So go pluck yourself in the cage. You may find that you'll never want to be freed again.

However, to truly comprehend the beauty of this film, you must see the European Cut.The U.S. version is still a great movie, but it cuts out 24 minutes which contain much of the heart of the movie and most of what makes the film a work of art instead of the usual action fodder. Elements of the story which are only hinted at in the U.S. cut become the centerpiece of the story when the un-cut version is seen.The two main characters are a recently-orphaned girl who is wise beyond her years and a hit-man who is still an innocent. Their relationship unfolds against a backdrop of murder and revenge as director Luc Besson explores issues of age and maturity, good and evil, and the interplay of life, death and love.The acting in this film is superb. Reno has an expressive face which conveys a myriad of emotions with great sensitivity and few words. He is cold as ice as the almost super-human 'professional', but his performance is most moving when he reveals his sensitive side. Watching as his wounded soul slowly begins to heal is enough to touch the heart of any woman, but it is handled so subtly that it never becomes too 'sappy'.In her film debut, Natalie Portman turns in a performance that is beautiful beyond belief. She manages the transition from a frightened child to a woman capable of killing so convincingly that it makes the relationship between she and Leon not only believable, but understandable.Gary Oldman is just the best psycho there is, and it is kind of nice to see him without all the strange makeup for a change. As a dirty cop in this film he personifies evil, and it is a joy to watch him do his thing.The special effects are all you could hope for. Besson does great actions scenes - especially the explosions. There is also a lot of humor and when you throw in the tender love story - this picture has it all!

Now Robin Williams has died I felt like the world came crashing down on me I couldn't believe he had gone so I had to rewatch hook and remember Robin as he was, a great actor.Robin Williams is, as always, brilliant. He's hilarious and I think he makes a great Peter Pan - definitely one of my favourite portrayals. He plays the grown-up Peter fantastically, as a man who has forgotten all about Neverland and his life before growing up. Once he returns to the magical world and finally remembers, his take on Peter was wonderful to watch. Who'd of thought Robin Williams in tights would have been so cool? I loved the lost boys in this. They were so dependent on Peter and had clearly missed him so much and the ending when he left again just ripped my heart out. They were also so funny (BANGARANG) when they were 'training' Peter to become himself again (the dinner scene was just awesome). Also Ru-fi-ooooooooooooooo.Dustin Hoffman as Hook was just splendid. He's such a great actor and I've learned to expect nothing better than AWESOME from him. And he delivered. Hook is perfectly creepy but also kind of strangely likable.The puns in this movie provide a lot of laughs (perhaps more now, watching as an adult see the dinner scene when Peter and Rufio get into an argument) and the film is just a joy to watch throughout.Okay, so it's not a completely Oscar-worthy masterpiece.

Having not read the book, I'm unsure whether this film fails due to the fact that it is a poor adaptation of the source material or whether it's a good adaptation that I just failed to connect with. We'll just say that the jury is out on that for the time being and I'll crack on with the review....The film begins OK with Sister Helen Prejean (Susan Sarandon) going to visit death row inmate Matthew Poncelet (Sean Penn)when he sends her a letter asking for her to visit him and try to assist him with his appeal when he finds that there are no lawyers that are prepared to help him (the very fact that no lawyers are prepared to help him should be ringing alarm bells). However, as the film progressed I found it harder and harder to invest in. It didn't help that we don't seem to get much insight into Poncelet's character and it therefore makes it difficult to make any sort of connection with him (the fact that he was objectionable most of the time didn't help). We also have no real understanding of why Poncelet wrote to Prajean in the first place - it therefore makes it difficult to make a connection between the 2 characters. This may have been explained better in the book, but the very fact that Robbins doesn't seem to bother explaining this in the film means that the narrative is somewhat sloppy as a result. Another major problem for me is that some of the character's actions just aren't believable; I found it continually difficult to believe that a nun would be so keen to help a death row inmate who 1) Is arrogant, condescending and dismissive towards her 2) Who she doesn't even know 3) Isn't even sure whether or not he's innocent. Prejean tracks down a lawyer to try to take on Poncelet's case even though it felt like Prejean put more effort into freeing Poncelet than the lawyer did. We have Poncelet's mother who hasn't visited him in prison for a long time, but after a visit from Prajean both mother and family decide to start visiting Poncelet and they are all playing happy families when they visit - it just felt a bit phony to me. We then have Prajean and lawyer Hilton Barber (Robert Prosky) who have a week to try and get Poncelet off death row, even though he's already been on death row for 6 years with several lawyers being unable to get him off death row. If he's been unsuccessful for the last 6 years, what are the odds of them being successful in the next 7 days??The worst aspect of this film was the way it ended; just before Poncelet is due to be executed he admits to killing the 2 victims (even though he'd protested his innocence throughout) and then as he's about to be put to death he tells Prajean that he loves her and she tells him that she loves him. What? Where did that come from? A nun loving a death row inmate even after she discovers that he did kill those 2 victims? Come on!!!.There are a few positives; the acting was good (particularly from Penn and Sarandon) and the directing was also good. The problems lay with the messy script, characters that I didn't care about and a whole host of unbelievable scenarios - strange that I found a lot of what I saw to be unbelievable even though it's based on a true story. It's not an awful film, but it's not that good either.

The rot includes fulfilling aspirations of parents which are way different from his own, it include running for the marks and grades, it includes missing out on fun which we are supposed to have as teenagers, it essentially includes that we do not identify our dream and shall be living others dreams. Teenagers or adolescents do not know what they want to be in many cases, they figure that out as they grow. This can be because of influence by friends or by the college teachers or even an idea he just got or maybe a talent which he would have recognized just then. But before realizing that, they are pushed in many cases by parents into a corner and the parents squeeze what they want them to be. It is a failure and many teenagers succumb to this pressure and even give up life. The more than half, ordinary guys follow the aspirations of their parents which they believe is good for them.

The anatomically female characters are so horribly depicted that it made for some painful watching. That is with the exception of Marion (Sarah Chadwick), Tick\/Mitzi's wife, who is lesbian or bisexual herself. Mitzi (Hugo Weaving), Bernadette (Terrence Stamp) and Felicia (Guy Pierce) have casino gig in Alice Springs, about 1800 miles from Sydney. Felicia purchased a hooptie bus that acted as a makeshift tour vehicle and christened it Priscilla. From then on, the film documents the adventures and travails of the trio until they arrive in the Northern Territory.Their first misadventure occurs when they go shopping and drinking at the Palace Hotel. The place was anything but a Palace. They encounter Shirley (June Marie Bennett), a scruffy looking woman who informs the trio that they are not welcome because of their appearance associated with their orientation. Bernadette in turn responds with some nastiness of her own and calls Shirley a mullet and tells her that the only satisfaction that she'll ever get is when she lights her lady bits on fire. Later on, Bernice and Shirl go toe to toe in a drinking contest, where she loses to Bernadette. The message here is haters never win and a transgendered woman's as strong as any biological female. However, females have a lower tolerance for alcohol than males.There are other snags along the way such as the malfunctioning bus, which serves as a metaphor for the little engine that can. The girls suffer anti-gay bigotry where Felicia is almost mobbed by a group of angry macho men.

The film shows how dull and unsophisticated conservatively minded people are.The only people who express empathy are the Aboriginals, whose names we never find out. In the film they're just desert dwellers who play along with the queens. The trio appear uncomfortable (especially Tick\/Mitzi) being with the indigenous people. The reasons for this apparent discomfort are unknown, but there's the underlying message that native peoples are not seen in civilization. These people behaved with more humanity than the other townspeople that they encounter until Alice Springs.Cynthia (Julia Cortez) was the stereotypical Asian mail-order bride depicted as a vulgar lunatic whose purpose in the film was like that of a minstrel character who has one special trick shoot golf balls from her vagina. Bob justifies treating his wife roughly because she's always making a fool of herself. In addition to this, Cynthia's a lousy cook. She can't do anything right, except for that one thing. Her presence in the film acts as a contrast to Ralph\/Bernadette by sending the message that heterosexual relationships are a joke. Bernadette is portrayed like a better lady than Cynthia and eventually snags her husband, Bob. He also treats Bernadette much, much better than Cynthia. Bob's very fascinated to be dating a former Les Girl (showgirl). There are several instances where the film and characters negatively depict the female anatomy and personhood, yet these men have earned their living impersonating women and lip synching to songs sung by women. The male characters live unhappily because they appropriate and disfigure the same thing that they aspire to be womanhood.The end scenes with Benjamin (Mark Holmes), Marion and Tick's son, as as heartbreaking as they are troubling. Benj is a loving and understanding boy, yet he knows too much about his parent's intimate affairs for a child his age. He knows of his parents lovers and has a blase attitude about the situation with Mommy and Daddy. The scene with Benj sitting on top of a man's shoulders while watching Daddy Mitzi and Felicia's drag show was disconcerting.

In the film they're just desert dwellers who play along with the queens. The trio appear uncomfortable (especially Tick\/Mitzi) being with the indigenous people. The reasons for this apparent discomfort are unknown, but there's the underlying message that native peoples are not seen in civilization. These people behaved with more humanity than the other townspeople that they encounter until Alice Springs.Cynthia (Julia Cortez) was the stereotypical Asian mail-order bride depicted as a vulgar lunatic whose purpose in the film was like that of a minstrel character who has one special trick shoot golf balls from her vagina. Bob justifies treating his wife roughly because she's always making a fool of herself. In addition to this, Cynthia's a lousy cook. She can't do anything right, except for that one thing. Her presence in the film acts as a contrast to Ralph\/Bernadette by sending the message that heterosexual relationships are a joke. Bernadette is portrayed like a better lady than Cynthia and eventually snags her husband, Bob. He also treats Bernadette much, much better than Cynthia. Bob's very fascinated to be dating a former Les Girl (showgirl). There are several instances where the film and characters negatively depict the female anatomy and personhood, yet these men have earned their living impersonating women and lip synching to songs sung by women. The male characters live unhappily because they appropriate and disfigure the same thing that they aspire to be womanhood.The end scenes with Benjamin (Mark Holmes), Marion and Tick's son, as as heartbreaking as they are troubling. Benj is a loving and understanding boy, yet he knows too much about his parent's intimate affairs for a child his age. He knows of his parents lovers and has a blase attitude about the situation with Mommy and Daddy. The scene with Benj sitting on top of a man's shoulders while watching Daddy Mitzi and Felicia's drag show was disconcerting. Children are not supposed to be in bars and casinos where adults drink, smoke, have sex and curse.Despite these things, I decided to rate the film 7\/10 because this an honest and unsanitized look into the LGBT community. That helps me to better understand them and some of their issues. It's important to not sugarcoat things in order to make others feel better about themselves.

I just felt compelled to review my favourite movie of his. On a rainy day back in 1980- something, my mother sat my brother, sister and me down and put on the movie, Dead Poets Society. Little did I know what a profound impact that movie, and its characters would have on me. The film is bursting with quotable material, and my siblings and I quote it to this day O Captain My Captain, Carpe Diem, Seize the Day, and of course, Make Your Lives Extraordinary. It's not until we grow older that we can look back on a teacher like John Keating and see what he really meant to us, the chances he made us take, the way he made us feel alive. I look back now on Robin Williams' performance and see one of the most flawless performances of all time. When you watch the movie, it's hard to think of hammy, manic Robin Williams giving such a nuanced and subtle performance. It's almost as though Sean Maguire in Good Will Hunting is who John Keating became. And funny how his most subtle performances may be the ones he's most remembered for. When I heard the news of Robin's death, I was taken back to this film and really felt how integral this movie actually was to my childhood.

A mysterious cult is holding Michael's niece hostage that they may also take her baby. Jamie, his niece, is eventually able to escape thanks to the help of a member of said cult. Michael and the cult hunt her down as she tries to escape through the corridors of her prison. Jamie is able to elude the cult and get out of the building with her baby. She is chased through town and eventually cornered in a barn where she is murdered by Michael, but not before hiding her baby in a bus stop. The paranoid survivor and Haddonfield resident Tommy Doyle is able to locate the baby. Tommy and Dr. Loomis are now both alerted to Michael's revival, thanks to Jamie's radio broadcast that helped Tommy find the newborn.

The entire Back To The Future series in my opinion is absolutely brilliant. It is the quintessential 80's film, the pinnacle of time travel movies, some of the best characters, best script, and cutting edge special effects that still hold up today as far as I'm concerned. When I was a kid I probably would have slapped a 10\/10 on all three of the films. I adored them and still do. In watching Back To The Future 2 for the first time in ages I was shocked to discover that while I still LOVED it...I certainly noticed a few of its (albeit very minor) flaws. Back To The Future 2 is actually very different from the original film. Its darker, over the top, even a little cheesy in some regards. It pokes fun at itself and the first film, gives us everything we could possibly want from a sequel while still managing to be a very different sort of movie. I can't think of a single other film that actually returns to the first movie in a whole new way. This is revolutionary, one of a kind and continues to floor me watching Marty's continuing adventures in the backdrop of the first film. This series could be rife with plot holes given how twisted the plot is and I'm sure if you scientifically dissect the film there are some but none that glare the average movie goer in the face. This is a brilliant sequel.Michael J. Fox is Marty Mcfly. In the first film he was smooth, suave, the perfect cool kid that you immediately wanted to be or at least hang around him. Fox returns in Back To The Future 2 and I noticed that his Mcfly this time around is a little less slick but still a great hero. He's almost just a little bit goofy compared to the first film which is a flaw to me but a minor one. Mcfly is still terrific and his turn as his own son and his daughter is awesome to watch. Christopher Lloyd absolutely shines again as the most zany and eccentric inventory Doc. Brown. Lloyd is perfect and no one else could ever make Doc come to life like always has. Best of all the backbone of this series is the incredible chemistry between Fox and Lloyd and this friendship that seems very real. Thomas F. Wilson also returns as senior Biff, middle aged Biff and young Biff and is the ultimate bully and villain. He plays all three roles flawlessly and is so great. He is one of the all time villainous greats while being a complete moron at the same time. Lea Thompson also returns in a much smaller role as Marty's Mom. Thompson is good again but the role is definitely a background role this time around. Many of the supporting characters return as well but Jennifer is replaced by the lovely Elisabeth Shue (her role is very small as well) and Crispin Glover is replaced in the future George role by Jeffrey Weissman though you can hardly tell.This trilogy single-handedly made Robert Zemeckis one of the best directors in my books. Never mind the fact that he then went on to create the incredible world of Forrest Gump (another of my top five films) and many other amazing movies. If you look at Back To The Future 2 (and the entire trilogy) from a film making perspective you can't help but be awe inspired. It is such a unique idea and pioneers the science fiction genre but creating very real characters that you relate to while being silly and outrageous and excessive and sometimes ridiculous and you love every single minute of it. The legendary soundtrack from the first film (Huey Lewis and The News) is lacking from the second film though they still have that amazing theme song of course at the height of every great climactic scene. Hoverboards, past, present and future in one film, running gags galore (manure truck, certain one liners, scenes from the first film, Great Scott, the delorean...everything comes together nearly flawlessly. To further prove Zemeckis and Spielberg's brilliance working together on this, there are things they sort of forced into this sequel that weren't in the first (Marty and his fear of being called Chicken for instance) but they work it in their flawlessly and made it instantly memorable. You can't watch the first film without seeing the second...or the third but each film stands firmly in its own unique way. If you have never seen this series...you are absolutely missing out on movie genius and the most entertaining trilogy ever made and if you have seen it before, go watch it again because its rare to have this much fun. 9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"12 August 2014","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" After catching one of my all time favourite films (which I reviewed 1000 reviews ago) on the big screen last week, I decided to power through the trilogy since it has been awhile.

The atmosphere is consistently unsettling, the action is often disturbing and Hans Zimmer's wonderful score complements the mood of the piece perfectly. Its interesting set-up is typical of a routine murder mystery but soon it becomes clear that what's to follow is going to be far less predictable. Additionally, a marvellous plot twist very late on in the movie leaves each of the main characters with the wrong impression of what they've just experienced and for the ex-cop, this proves to be devastating.During a retirement party for homicide detective (and reluctant retiree) Jerry Black (Jack Nicholson), Reno Police Department receives a report that the dead body of an 8-year-old girl has been found in a snow-covered wood nearby. It transpires that young Ginny Larsen had been brutally murdered and sexually assaulted and that the youngster who discovered her body had seen a man leaving the crime scene. Native American Toby Jay Wadenah (Benicio Del Toro) is a known sex-offender who fits the description provided by the youngster and soon the mentally handicapped suspect is taken in for questioning.Jerry's aggressive colleague Stan Krolak (Aaron Eckhart) interviews the profoundly confused suspect and elicits a confession but very shortly after, Wadenah grabs a police officer's gun and kills himself. Krolak, Police Captain Eric Pollack (Sam Shepard) and all their colleagues immediately regard the case as closed but Jerry isn't convinced that Wadenah was the killer. When Jerry tells the victim's parents the dreadful news about their daughter, he's pressured by Ginny's mother into promising to find the real killer. Having made this promise, he carries on with his investigation after his retirement and soon discovers evidence to support a theory that Ginny's murder was one of a series in which the victims were young blonde girls who wore red dresses. When he shares his findings with Krolak and Pollack, they regard his theory as absurd and think that he's become irrational.Jerry goes fishing, buys a run down gas station and starts a relationship with a local waitress who has a young daughter.

Well, he doesn't even breath fire (that's like Spider-man not shooting webs), his origins are about as throw-away and unimportant as can be (considering the original Godzilla's metaphor, I feel his origins should NEVER be shrugged off), he doesn't battle any enemies and he's taken down by a taxi and a couple of jet missiles?!?! What?! I thought he was created by nukes! From miscasting (with the exception of Reno), to a lot of uninspired FX work (with the exception of the scenes before Zilla is revealed - after that, it just becomes a Jurassic Park rip-off), I personally don't see how this film can be enjoyed even when set aside from the original Godzilla universe. It gets lost in its own logic and expects its audience to be dumb enough to go along with it (giant lizard just disappearing? Come on!) Even for a Godzilla movie the characters suck... big time. In Toho's original Godzilla series our human characters were a majority of the time cartoony, yet had a certain charm and never got in the way of the beasties at hand.

A little raunchy humor, but not much...enough to be funny, not enough to offend.

Each team pulls itself up by the bootstraps and then comes the next national competition. Who will win? This was the first film in which I paid any attention to Kirsten Dunst, and she did very nicely here; very believable as the head cheer leader. I'm not familiar with Eliza Dushku, but she does fine here in a role as a sort of out-of-the-mainstream girl who reluctantly joins the cheerleaders.

The late Richard Hillman is very good at playing an obnoxiously (and fake) supportive two-timing boyfriend.

Nathan West is very good as one of the hunky male cheerleaders, as is Huntley Ritter, who plays a gay male cheerleader. The late Richard Hillman is very good at playing an obnoxiously (and fake) supportive two-timing boyfriend. Really, the entire cast does a terrific job, raising what could have been an obnoxious teen-movie into a very good motion picture. Kudos to the director and writer for making this a film that is better than might have been done with such topics.A surprisingly good film that just downright fun...and far above the level you might think it will be. Recommended. ","genre":"Comedy, Sport"},{"date":"12 August 2014","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" The Thing is one of the most suspenseful films ever made. This is a remake that is nothing like the original, and that's alright to me. Instead of the original monster, they made a new one who can morph into creatures that it absorbs. This ads an element of suspense that the original lacks.The movie takes place in Antarctica. The main characters are secluded from other humans, which stops them from being able to escape so easily. The movies starts out slow, but once the monster is introduced, it is one fright after the other. It can be rather gross, because of its great special effects, but that is not what makes it scary. It is so suspenseful not knowing who is the thing, and when you find out, you are shocked and horrified. The blood scene is so suspenseful, and when the blood jumps up, it is just scary. Of course, you can't forget the dog scene. 9\/10The ending is perfect. I like how it leaves with a cliffhanger, leaving them out there to freeze to death. Great movie.
