It's got hits, bad language, Robert DeNiro, gambling, lots of Italian Americans - it's all there. Furthermore, it's got a great soundtrack, the Las Vegas setting makes for a great location and the acting is largely very good...but somehow, this just isn't a great film. Scorsese has missed the mark thanks to a lack of emotion. There is no reason to care for the characters in this movie, and that makes the film hard to connect with on the whole. The movie also follows the common Scorsese format, in that some guy gets rich and respected, then something bad happens and he finds himself back where he started. In fact, the ending of this movie is only an I'm a schmo away from being a complete copy of Goodfellas. Still, at least the movie manages to stay interesting for most of it's runtime, and it's easy to forgive the flaws when you're watching Joe Pesci threatening someone who's head he's jammed into a vice.Casino lasts almost three hours, and it's fair to say therefore that this movie is overlong. It's not so bad for the first two hours, but once the film enters the final third; cracks begin to appear and the film isn't as interesting as it was, not much unlike Goodfellas; which also suffered from a trite final third. Tarantino's influence on cinema is felt in this movie, and that is obvious from the way that Scorsese has seen fit to saturate the movie in 'cool' old classics. Still, some of these songs; such as Fleetwood Mac's Go Your Own Way and The Animals' The House of the Rising Sun are really good songs and actually bode well with the action on screen. For this movie, Martin Scorsese has re-recruited the excellent pairing of Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci, and both give their trademark excellent performances in this film. Casino may well be DeNiro's last great performance before he went on his downward spiral, which started with the fellow 1995 movie Heat. On the whole, while this film is technically sound, it lacks emotional bite and there will be times during the film when your interest will trail off. It's an entertaining ride, but it's one that is ultimately shallow.

Frank Miller along (co-writer) W. Green had clear in their minds what made Robocop the success it was. Violence, irony, social commentary, clever dialogue all that is present here again, yes but it's all a bit less intense, anyway to beat the quality of the first movie it would be necessary the presence of Verhoeven, Miner and Neumeier. But the new creators had respect towards their predecessors and started to build the new story using the previous material. If that's not enough there are lots of incredible action scenes, great even to the standards of today. Everything is tied by the solid thread of a great script.

Of course, Wonka has a change of heart, and decides to hold a contest whereby the people who can find one of the five golden tickets randomly (maybe, all of the winners were conveniently children, four of which had horrible manners) in Wonka candy. It could be anywhere. One by one, it seems that the tickets are being found, particularly by obnoxious kids who are all about the same age. (Veruca Salt, the most horrid and funniest of them all, would later inspire a late 90s alternative band). The selfish British brat, the slothy German boy, the record gumchewer with the sleazy car salesman father, and the boy who lives in front of the television. And there's only one ticket left. Meanwhile, a pathetic, depressed little boy named Charlie Bucket wants nothing more than to get hold of one of those tickets and witness the magic of the Wonka factory. Well, cheer up Charlie, because its about to happen.The trip in Wonka is more than just an invitation for unrivaled fun, however. It is a test. One of Wonka's rivals known as Slugworth, has promised a valuable sum to each of the children who steal from Wonka one of his newest inventions -- an Everlasting Gobstopper-- so that his company might steal the ingredients. Will all remain loyal to Slugworth? This is one of Gene Wilder's best performances, perfectly making the Wonka character his own. This was also the movie that introduced to the world the cautionary cult favorite midgets known as the Oompa Loompas, slaves who were rescued by Wonka to...well serve as his slaves. And, serving as a brief psychedelic inject into the events in the factory, make the lessons learned more obvious than they could have already been. Charlie Bucket's character, however, could not be written to be more pathetic, as though the filmmakers were absolutely sure that this was the kid you had the most sympathy for. From the mother working in the laundry hand-washing clothes, to the bare one room house and the enormous bed shared by all of the grandparents with counterpart names, to Charlie's constantly furrowed brow and curled lip. But, aside from this minor flaw, the movie has so many memorable things about it. I particularly like the Dr. Suess-esque setting. I can see why Tim Burton might be asked to be the next to recreate the story of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, as the original looked like his style to begin with (like the foamy float machine or the bizarre sequence where Wonka appears to go momentarily mad). Nonetheless, may the legacy of the first live on for years to come. It is still one of the greatest family films ever made.

Nonetheless, may the legacy of the first live on for years to come. It is still one of the greatest family films ever made.

I watched it solely because Nicholes Cage, one of my favorite actors was in it, so I thought it couldn't be that bad. And I was right. It was actually better then I thought it would be.There isn't any way to describe this movie except a lighter, funnier, sappier version of Indecent proposal. While indecent proposal the book, was great, the movie was pretty bad. This however, was a really fun time from beginning to end. Cage and parker make an adorable screen couple and James Caan was absolutely great. This movie hooks you, in the first five minutes, and retains a fun atmosphere throughout. It doesn't hurt that the two main settings for the movie are Las Vegas and Hawaii. The movie will make you want to visit both places. It is also peppered with unforgettable funny characters amidst two great settings, one a non stop party(Vegas) and one stunning peaceful island beauty(Hawai).What's also great about this movie is it is actually unpredictable in a few places and I don't say that lightly because there are not a lot of romantic comedies that can do that. Give you the warm fuzzies-oh yeah most of them do that no problem, but it's the rare romantic comedy that can leave you guessing.For me, I didn't know, at first, who parker's Betsy would actually end up with.

Today's critics and auteurs don't champion him; you won't read much about him in Entertainment Weekly. For Zinnemann, the script was the thing, what he worked from, and his greatest genius may have been in choosing the right scripts and knowing how to do them justice.From Here To Eternity may well be Zinnemann at his highest tide, though IMDb voters seem to prefer High Noon. Then there's A Man For All Seasons, the film of the year in 1966, though its hard to imagine a film that represents the ethos of the 1960s less. A Man For All Seasons presents us with an unfashionable character who refuses to surrender his conscience to the dictates of king and countrymen, resolute instead in his devotion to God and Roman Catholic Church.When statesmen lead their country without their conscience to guide them, it is short road to chaos, Thomas More tells his nominal boss, Cardinal Wolsey, when the latter unsuccessfully presses him to give his blind assent to King Henry VIII's request for a convenient divorce. Perhaps out of pique, Wolsey makes sure More inherits his office of Counselor of the Realm, where More's sterling convictions are really put to the test.More is a marvel of subtleties, tensile steel covered in a velvet glove, a mild-mannered lion trying at every turn to do well even though his political savvy knows how dangerous that can be. As a lawyer, More knows the angles, yet he is no sharpie. He respects the law too much for that. Rather, he sees in law the only hope for man's goodness in a fallen world. I'd give the Devil benefit of the law, for my own safety's sake, he explains.Paul Scofield plays More in such a way as to make us not only admire him but identify with him, and come to value both his humanness and his spirituality. His tired eyes, the way he gently rebuffs would-be bribers around Hampton Court, his genuine professions of loyalty to Henry even as he disagrees with the matter of his divorce, all speak to one of those great gifts of movies, which is the ability to create a character so well-rounded and illuminating in his window on the human condition we find him more haunting company than the real people we meet in life. It's a gift the movies seldom actually deliver on, so when someone like Scofield makes it happen, it is a object of gratitude as much as admiration.The script, adapted by Robert Bolt from his stage play, is very literate and careful to explain the facts of More's dilemma. It moves too slowly and opaquely at times to qualify A Man For All Seasons as a true classic, that and a supporting cast full of one-note performances, though some are quite good (a few, however, are notably flat.) I especially liked Robert Shaw as a young and thin Henry VIII, full of vigor yet also a childish temperament and inconsistent mind. He demands More not oppose his marriage to Anne Boleyn, then decides he must have either More's outright assent or else his head. There's no bargaining with such a man. Perhaps More was better off standing on his principals as he did than climbing into bed with homicidal Henry. Just ask Anne.Zinnemann presents some interesting visual images in A Man For All Seasons, letting the period detail inform the story without overwhelming it. Several times, such as during the opening credits, inside More's cell at the Tower of London, and during More's trial, the camera shoots through narrow openings surrounded by high stone walls, a reminder not only of More's own trapped situation but the human condition. Aspirations of divinity may be unfashionable, even dangerous to one's health, but they present mankind with its one hope for overcoming its base nature, the dead-end character of temporality. A Man For All Seasons is a rallying cry for just such an approach to life, and remains undeniably effective in its artful, artless way.

The leading actors are great. Jason Statham is one of the best actors these days. Alan Ford also gives an incredible display as Bricktop. He is just amazing. Benicio Del Toro is also great. He isn't in a lot of scenes, but whenever he is on screen you immediately get to like it. The story is perfect for this type of movie. Diamonds, money, England, funny accent, funny characters. The Pikeys are EXTREME. You just love the accent. When they tell Turkish and Tommy they want a caravan for Mickey's mom and the two of them can't understand what are they saying, or when they are betting on the field about the last match and the rabbit. It's just amazing. And the one-liners are great. Just great. My favorites are Alan Ford's Do you know what nemesis means? A righteous infliction of retribution, manifested by an appropriate agent. Personified in this case by a horrible c-nt. Me! and Jason Statham's Protecion from what? Zee Germans! I give this movie 12 out of 10. Watch it. WATCH IT! NOW! You'll not regret it.

Having said that, the ones I'm really familiar with are STREETCAR, CAT and IGUANA, with the latter (featuring a great Richard Burton at somewhere near his peak plus an unforgettable Oscar-nominated Grayson Hall) being my personal favorite perhaps because, despite the expected emotional highlights and powerhouse performances, it allows itself a beguiling sense of humor.Unfortunately, humor is something which A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE has very little of while the play itself, taking place as it does entirely within the ramshackle tenement block which the characters themselves inhabit (as opposed to, say, the relatively open-air THE NIGHT OF THE IGUANA, with its Mexican bus rides and seaside sequences, not to mention more exotic characters), has a decidedly claustrophobic feel to it which ultimately translates into a highly theatrical film.Don't get me wrong the performances by the four star players are beyond great (particularly Brando and Leigh) but, being something of a writer myself, I'm rather in awe of Tennessee Williams' way with words&#133;it's just that, very much like Shakespeare, there's just too many of them &#150; which can be quite an exhausting experience to be sure.

And true, 'Reality Bites' was clearly trying so hard to be hip and with the times that there are points when its characters can seem very distant now (there can't be too many people today who'd consider dancing around a gas station like an unrestrained idiot to be a fitting definition of coolness &#150; nowadays viewers will probably be more inclined to identify with the clerk looking on with bemusement in that scene). Nonetheless, the uncertainties that come with entering adulthood and establishing a steady independent life of your own in the real world will always be relevant issues to young people no matter what the era, so any flick that deals with them has a fair chance of striking a chord with such an audience (being a young twenty-something myself, they're certainly hot on my own mind). Sadly, they never amount to much more here than the backdrop for a familiar love triangle yarn, albeit the familiar love triangle yarn as you've never seen it before. Our lead girl still gets torn between two guys, each from a different rung on the social ladder, only this time round it's actually the down-to-earth businessman making a healthy living for himself (Michael) who's an amiable mass of benevolence, and the laid-back young musician struggling to make ends meet (Troy) who acts like an offhand, self-righteous bully for much of his screen time. That the film still expects our sympathies to lie in the usual places regardless and root for Troy simply because he's the underdog is just the slightest bit galling (let's ignore the fact that Leliana, the lucky heroine who has the honour of choosing between them, is something of a whiny, irresponsible brat herself). Perhaps the only thing more fatal than choosing to go with such a wearisome and predictable formula is using characters that don't even comfortably fit it.Fortunately, 'Reality Bites' does have a number of small redeeming qualities which come along at just the right moments and may make us intermittently forget that this is all going to be part of something very hollow and routine overall. It's stylish, well-crafted and reasonably entertaining, if you can forgive the occasional patch of cringe-inducing dialogue (I'm a non-practicing Jew Hey, I'm a non-practicing virgin &#150; dear lord), and Ben Stiller adds life and flair from whichever side of the camera he's on. His debut direction feels surprisingly accomplished, panning the various scenes from a selection of imaginative angles and connecting them together very smoothly, while his character is easily the most likable and understandable of the bunch (too bad he wasn't meant to be). John Mahoney (better known for his role as Martin Crane in the popular sitcom 'Frasier') has a memorable cameo as a disgruntled TV show host, the soundtrack is filled with lots of little audio treats, and the people in the prop department have certainly provided us with plenty of interesting things to look at &#150; it's actually quite fun to watch if you keep your eye out for all the novelty memorabilia that these characters have hoarded; in addition to Michael's beloved Dr Zaius figurine, a Garfield-shaped telephone and a metal 'Charlie's Angels' lunch-box, among others, have made it to the set.But what really hurts 'Reality Bites' in the end, other than the hackneyed storyline, is just how much depth and substance the protagonists are sorely lacking. Considering that it revolves around a recently-graduated girl determined to demonstrate that she and her friends are more than just shallow Generation X-ers, devoid of any desires that extend beyond having sex and eating pizza, it doesn't exactly do a great deal to convince us otherwise. Most of their time is seemingly devoted to nothing more ambitious than messing around and having spats with each other, while the more serious material, including a subplot which sees Leliana's best friend Vickie awaiting the results of a test for HIV, is downplayed so considerably that you never get the impression that any of them are terribly concerned. The back-stories we hear about rough childhoods of divorced or neglectful parents are equally perfunctory, and the sad fact that Troy's dad is currently dying from prostate cancer is treated very incidentally by the film as a whole - what little is made of it feels more like an emotional blackmail designed to make us feel sympathy for the pretentious Troy than an actual aspect of his character.It gives us something good every now and then, but overall 'Reality Bites' just isn't strong or satisfying enough to qualify as a coming of age classic (don't even think about comparing it to 'the Graduate', or even 'Risky Business').

The loss of the Flying Saucer is not the problem it is why in the world would you wish to bring that huge block of ice into your shelter and then in order to allow it to remain, I guess frozen, brake the windows.Why didn't you just keep it outside perhaps restrained by ropes and such but out of harms way and still frozen.However all up to this point is well and good.Here we begin to find out just how increasingly dangerous this being is from another world and it is indeed an intimidating prospect.The result of the encounter with the Sled Dogs allows a very real and different focus to occur and from something undetermined to a more threatening position.The counter to the alarm sounded by this abrupt change is led by a scientist named Dr. Carrington,whose position was unequivocal prior to the arrival of U.S.Military Team which was sent for as a result of the landing.Though working in tandem,Dr. Carrington believes that science should prevail even if it means sacrificing perhaps our lives and indeed his actions place the entire compound in a compromised state as he fails to provide critical information as the deadly consequences of this become evident.The encroaching danger reaches a type of climax when it is discovered that this huge carrot lives on blood and it is further determined that this visitor is not fooling around.They are indeed very threatened and the picture,its pace and all around provide for the increased sense of danger.The showdown is no fun and when Captain Henry says ok you two,come a running.He is referring to the real attempt made by our visitor upon the very survival of this North Pole weather station.This is a very good film with very little in the way of special effects, however good story telling made this work.It worked when I saw this film on television many many years ago and it worked even up to today.A highly recommended Science Fiction film whose 1951 release is justified in it being referred to as a Science Fiction Classic.

This is one of, if not the best role, I have ever seen Nicole Kidman (Grace) perform in. I enjoy a movie that does not need to be done up in special effects or filled with cursing and nudity. You will not find any of this in this particular movie. Grace lives in a secluded mansion with her two children. Her husband went off to war and never returned. One day, three strangers appear at the doorstep of Grace's house. She hires them as servants and then strange things start to happen. The movie has some great scenes which scared the pants off of me! There are many twists in the movie which add a nice flavor to it. Just when I thought I had it all figured out, nope! Another surprise. If you enjoy a good suspense flick and if you are into guessing what's going to happen next, definitely watch this film. I can't stress enough how much I enjoyed it.
