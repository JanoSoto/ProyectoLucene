Which brings me to a point that at some point people tend to go into the dark side. Total control blinded by instinctual desires of a greater existence. Though what end will one end up? That's what I feel about the aura of the movie &#145;Psycho' by Alfred Hitchcock.In most suspense movies, or even horror the most crucial element is sound. Now, the music for the film created a tense feel, which made it feel subtly unsettling. As I delved into the score I felt a little bit cheated by the repetitious use of the theme song throughout the movie. This did not however take away from the suspense.Movies like this are not to be spoiled. For the way the movie was filmed it created a sense of mystery. While certain key elements of the plot play through, Hitchcock was a master at distorting the truth. Having the camera at an angle to not see a face, or make it seem very closed in. Under these styles of filming the suspense lasts throughout the entire picture.Now, I'll be brief on the shower scene. Everyone and their mother have at least heard of this scene. The woman was Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), who is also the main character. Well, as I watched this scene in its entirety I was a little shocked by how it was filmed. Now I know it must have been painfully hard to film the scene and not reveal too much skin. Though how it was done was more artistic as opposed real.Finally Hitchcock is a man of many surprises. To build a multi-perspective on what is going on in a film has been adapted into many works after his time. For this movie I would gladly recommend this to anyone, who can see past its age. Though I feel this film has the strength to live on. I guess it is how Hitchcock used his skills. His movies are bittersweet. One part all is well, and the other part is psycho.

When I saw the cover, I thought, 'oh dumb, another boring patriotic American film that drags on too long and is always boring'. How wrong was I? This film turned out to have one of the most amazing scripts in film history. While some critics and probably the government responded foully to the film's questioning of the American government's honesty to the public, personally I was astounded by the quality screenwriting presented here. We get a mixture of theories and characters, some fictitious, and all the while I was so engaged by all the evidence and ideas presented.--This film richly deserved its Oscar win for Best Editing, I think it was a brilliantly edited film. The mixture of real life footage from the day Kennedy was shot and modern-day filmed and acted scenes were very well done. I also loved the use of black-and-white for the flashback scenes, several times I had to ask the person next to me or my stupid history teacher if that what I just saw was real footage or filmed and acted.--JFK is lined with a star-studded cast who all turn in excellent performances. It's always hard portraying a real person and paying respect to that person you're acting as and being believable in the role, and the stars who played real people in this film (Tommy Lee Jones, Gary Oldman, Kevin Costner) did a terrific job at doing just that. I was especially convinced by Costner, an actor I've never really liked all that much, but he impressed me a lot here. Gary Oldman was also the perfect Lee Harvey Oswald, appropriately creepy and also hinting at some sort of depth or innocence to the character.--This isn't a movie that is solely about the assassination of former President John F. Kennedy, I also was very appreciative of the way the film showed how the investigation also interrupted things like Garrison's family life. This section of his life was temporarily shattered because he was always away during family gatherings and wasn't ever there for his family while carrying out the investigation. This leads to one terrifically acted scene between Costner and Sissy Spacek (Liz Garrison, Costner's wife in the film) where they basically go all-out at one another and their emotions and feelings about their current lives are expressed through a very well-constructed argument. It is one of the best scenes in the film because of the terrific writing and performances and how you can see from both characters' perspectives.--The mammothly big story comes to a fitting climax that should satisfy all who were engaged throughout the film's runtime. The last sequence, the court scene, was so exhilarating and energetic I was left literally gasping for breath. The final message in the film, that they will always be fighting for justice and the truth, was one of the more moving patriotic messages in the film.THE BAD--It is hard to sustain a three-hour epic piece that doesn't have any big action sequences or huge set pieces (save the final sequence), and at times the movie does tend to drag on and get a little boring. Stone tends to let the investigations drag on for a little long in a few instances, especially when the dialogue isn't as rich as in other sections of the film.RATING9\/10 - A daring, brave masterpiece from Oliver Stone, JFK will certainly enter the cinema hall of fame.IF YOU LIKED THIS MOVIE I RECOMMENDArlington Road (8\/10) Forrest Gump (10\/10) The Hurricane (9\/10) Spy Game (5\/10) Traffic (10\/10) ","genre":null},{"date":"17 February 2004","score":"0 out of 10 people found the following review useful","review":"  JFK (1991)THE GOOD--JFK is a film I watched for history.

The experience was so exciting I can still remember the tremendous impact it had on me. How can I ever forget that imaginative twist that was kept a secret, it was brilliant!A lot has been written and said about this story of three astronauts who crash on an alien planet run by intelligent apes. Why has it stood the test of time still captivating audiences 35 years after its release? Why should anyone watch this movie about talking monkeys? The most logical explanation is that it hits the bulls-eye and works on so many levels. It appeals to everyone's imagination- the young will be fascinated by the old fashioned adventure while the older thinking generation will be intrigued by the thought-provoking drama. But this isn't the only reason this film became a classic, many factors contributed to its success.Franklin Schaffner was given a great script by Rod Serling and Michael Wilson who had spent hundreds of hours perfecting their final draft. His direction was masterful. He managed to establish a strange unknown world by using mysterious locations. His cinematographer Leon Shamroy effectively used the bizarre landscape and his colour photography looks stunning. Adding effect to this strange atmosphere were the wonderful sets and the primitive looking architecture of the ape city.The acting and characterizations were memorable. Charlton Heston (Taylor) pulled off an outstanding performance. His forceful character and screen persona keeps the film involving and moving along at a good pace. We a rewarded with some great one-liners, he deserved an Oscar nomination at least. The rest of the main cast was excellent too. Roddy McDowall and Kim Hunter who play the chimpanzee protagonists Cornelius and Zira balance out the stronger role of Heston's by supporting him with lighter performances. They bring a sense of reality by showing us how simians of this upside-down world have evolved from the apes that currently live on earth. Their movements and expressions are so exceptional that you can see their emotions coming through the prosthetics. Working under so much make-up and costumes was not easy. The main antagonist is played by Maurice Evans who plays an orangutan leader Dr. Zaius who knows the big secret about man right from the start. His role is pivotal in maintaining the hatred apes have towards humans.The striking image of the apes is the film's strong element. The remarkable make-up is innovative and very realistic. It was ground-breaking in 1968 and today is equally effective. John Chambers won a special Academy Award for his efforts. He and his team needed many hours to apply the make-up to each ape character. This was extremely tiring and stressful for the actors. The different clothing and colourization used also strongly symbolized the apes' social structure, it was very thoughtful.Jerry Goldsmith's score is unique and original. It's an uncomfortable collection of noise from various common and exotic instruments, sounds that you've never experienced before. It is very haunting and maximizes the eerie and mysterious mood of the film and contributes to the weird atmosphere of the strange world.An intellectual view of the movie reveals the social, political and religious issues which are still valid today.

But this isn't the only reason this film became a classic, many factors contributed to its success.Franklin Schaffner was given a great script by Rod Serling and Michael Wilson who had spent hundreds of hours perfecting their final draft. His direction was masterful. He managed to establish a strange unknown world by using mysterious locations. His cinematographer Leon Shamroy effectively used the bizarre landscape and his colour photography looks stunning. Adding effect to this strange atmosphere were the wonderful sets and the primitive looking architecture of the ape city.The acting and characterizations were memorable. Charlton Heston (Taylor) pulled off an outstanding performance. His forceful character and screen persona keeps the film involving and moving along at a good pace. We a rewarded with some great one-liners, he deserved an Oscar nomination at least. The rest of the main cast was excellent too. Roddy McDowall and Kim Hunter who play the chimpanzee protagonists Cornelius and Zira balance out the stronger role of Heston's by supporting him with lighter performances. They bring a sense of reality by showing us how simians of this upside-down world have evolved from the apes that currently live on earth. Their movements and expressions are so exceptional that you can see their emotions coming through the prosthetics. Working under so much make-up and costumes was not easy. The main antagonist is played by Maurice Evans who plays an orangutan leader Dr. Zaius who knows the big secret about man right from the start. His role is pivotal in maintaining the hatred apes have towards humans.The striking image of the apes is the film's strong element. The remarkable make-up is innovative and very realistic. It was ground-breaking in 1968 and today is equally effective. John Chambers won a special Academy Award for his efforts. He and his team needed many hours to apply the make-up to each ape character. This was extremely tiring and stressful for the actors. The different clothing and colourization used also strongly symbolized the apes' social structure, it was very thoughtful.Jerry Goldsmith's score is unique and original. It's an uncomfortable collection of noise from various common and exotic instruments, sounds that you've never experienced before. It is very haunting and maximizes the eerie and mysterious mood of the film and contributes to the weird atmosphere of the strange world.An intellectual view of the movie reveals the social, political and religious issues which are still valid today.

I just saw the film last night and my head is still spinning with a trillion different feeling and conflicting emotions.  ***spoilers within*** The opening scene was gut-wrenching - I was immediately filled with a sick dread that this young boy would join the list of famous people, including his mother, who have died on the Long Island Expressway.  When the scene goes unresolved, balanced on a shaky rail as it was, the fear and dread of what will happen to Howie when the scene is inevitably revisited later in the film permeates every scene.  It is clear that he intends to make a descision, but unclear as to what that descision will be.  I had to have a drink before I could continue with the movie!The controversy with this film is that it portrays a pedophile not as a de-humanized monster, but a well-respected, generally nice guy who has a problem.  He is likeable, and the 'right kind' of boys seem drawn to him.  We never see him attempting to pick up anyone who isn't in some way 'looking for it' - such as the teen hustlers who populate the expressway rest stop.  When Howie enters the picture (a more conflicted and deep character I've never seen) he is drawn to Big John, not only because he is likeable and a potential friend, but also because he needs some guidance and love in his life.  Big John is needed to fill a void in his life - a void caused by the death of his mother, the incarceration of his father and the departure of his best friend.  He needs to feel loved (to feel love and to be loved back), and thinks he can find it in this most dubious and unlikely of characters.  And herein lies the controversy; if the boy in a relationship like this is a willing participant, and even in some ways a seducer (the way Howie glances back at Big John when he's urinating, sharing poetry and inner thoughts), then who exactly is the victim?  Roger Ebert was right in saying that a court case would see this subject matter in black and white, but the film itself occupies the darker shades of gray.The one thing that bothered me throughout the film (besides Howie's other waste-of-air friends, especially the sister banger) was the sudden departure of his best friend Gary.  Their relationship is close, intimate, but not sexual.  Howie is unaware of Gary's sexual practices until after he leaves, but he is alone in that category.  While it is clear that both boys are in love with each other (every scene when they are alone together has an implicit nature - long stares, play wrestling, flattering comments about the other's looks) nothing sexual ever happens, and it is with this regret that Howie enters Big John's life in search of the love and companionship that Gary took with him.  It bothers me that Gary left so abruptly and without saying goodbye - didn't the two of them want to go together? - but I figure this is what happened  Gary kept his two lives separate, Howie in one, Big John in the other.  When Howie tells Gary about meeting Big John and how he was set up to take the fall for the guns, Gary knew that he couldn't keep his two lives separate any more, and he liked Howie too much to get him involved in that.  I don't know, it's difficult to understand - I just really felt sorry for Howie being abandoned by absolutely everyone (the ending especially, which just didn't feel right).  But my fear and dread was relieved in the final scene, thank God, so at least there's that. An incredibly well made film, beautifully shot, endlessly challenging subject matter, but the ending and Gary's departure leaves me feeling unsatisfied - no happiness, seemingly too much for the protagonist to bear.

Maybe what people are praising is not the production - but the ideas and background. The age when gossip magazines threw back the covers of Hollywood (for the first time) to reveal actors and players as they really were. Sadly this just a bit of window dressing to tart up a tired old good-cop-bad-cop police drama.Forget the rave reviews There is nothing new going on in the foreground. Indeed it works it way to a climax so utterly predictable and shop-worn that it is almost unbelievable. After having some originality and vitality it comes down to a climax that would make a B movie western writer blush!Stacey is cool, Crowe is mad as hell (and not going to take it), Pierce is the college boy that does everything by the book. The guilty and the half guilty and the guilty-by-association get mixed up, but what the hell, they only get pushed up against a wall and have dirty tricks played on them. Probably how it was way back then.Bassinger gets an Oscar for doing nothing but looking sexy. I mean what does she do by way of acting? Look like an expensive hooker? Speak like she is jaded and embittered? Sharon Stone was better in Basic Instinct (and others!) and didn't get a mention for that. Even stranger still she seems to be barely in the movie (a glorified extra even?) and had to talked in to taking the role in the first place.

He is a great director who knows how to engage an audience.  All of his films have great cinematography.  And this film is no exception.  The cinematography and music combine to create a film rich in artistic expression.Having said that, the film's art cannot offset two fundamental flaws.  The first flaw is the screenplay. The story comes across as muddled.  The constant flashbacks back and forth from 1973 to an earlier time period, then fast forward to the 70's, then back to the 50's, then suddenly forward to the 60's; back and forth we go. This jerky approach to biography is jarring and irritating. Also, the story suffers from having a jumble of background people who are not well defined.  Pat Nixon and Kissinger are easy to spot.

It is the story of love born between two unlikely human beings amidst intense battles against nature and Ze Germans.  Charlie Allnut (Bogart) and Rose Sayer (Hepburn) have no business ever even speaking to each other under normal circumstances.  He being the gruff, unkempt lush Canadian captain of a one man ship, The African Queen, and she being the somewhat haughty, prim and proper British sister of a missionary killed by the Germans in Africa in the first World War.  The film is the story of their worlds meeting during a journey towards the destruction of the German's most powerful ship in Africa.What is it that makes this film so great?  It's all Bogart and Hepburn.  Of the roughly 105 minutes of film, it's them and them alone for about 90.  Arguably, no two actors have ever solely carried a film this good by themselves.  Both, especially Bogart, lose themselves in the roles completely.  Of immense help was, of course, director John Huston and the decision to go into Africa and not a Hollywood backlot or LA area river to do the filming.  The river and the jungle's harshly real environment made Bogart and Hepburn's performances all the better.  I could praddle on and on about why Bogart and Hepburn are so great in this film, but there are two key moments that sum it all up for me.  Both may seem unordinary overall, but say all that needs to be said about the two characters.  The first is when Rose, who has been calling (Bogart) Mr. Allnut for as long as she has known him, realizes she doesn't know his first name.  He tells her It's Charlie.  She gets a big smile on her face and repeats Charlie...that's a nice name.  Something about her demeanor when she says that displays, to me, an extraordinary joy and affection, maybe even love, for Charlie that her words perhaps do not.  Later, after Charlie and Rose have successfully navigated some white water rapids that seemed impossible to get through, Charlie grabs Rose, kisses her, and shouts Hip Hip Horray!  Again, there's something about the way Bogart does it that conveys to me the same joy, affection and love for Rose that she did earlier when repeating his name.Again, these two moments seem relatively insignificant in the context of the whole movie.  But in my opinion, they make the movie.  In this movie, as with most others, it's hard to give a damn about what characters say or do if you don't give a damn about them.  And those moments make me care about these two characters in a way that I ordinarily never would.  I shudder to think what results Bette Davis and David Niven, both fine actors, would have had with this filmThe ending of the film is, of course, implausible.  Without revealing anything, what are the odds of things happening as they did?  But who cares.  By the end, we as viewers should and would be ecstatic if Rose and Charlie were simply able to marry before their execution.  The boat ultimately blowing up and both our heroes coming out married and alive is icing on the cake.  The film ends with us knowing that despite what Keanu Reeves says, a relationship between two people who meet under extreme circumstances can work out.   Also, Robert Morley's brief performance as Rose's brother is memorable, as are most all of his performances.  And Bogart scene with the leeches is as horrifying as the same scene in Stand By Me kids is funny.

He being the gruff, unkempt lush Canadian captain of a one man ship, The African Queen, and she being the somewhat haughty, prim and proper British sister of a missionary killed by the Germans in Africa in the first World War.  The film is the story of their worlds meeting during a journey towards the destruction of the German's most powerful ship in Africa.What is it that makes this film so great?  It's all Bogart and Hepburn.  Of the roughly 105 minutes of film, it's them and them alone for about 90.  Arguably, no two actors have ever solely carried a film this good by themselves.  Both, especially Bogart, lose themselves in the roles completely.  Of immense help was, of course, director John Huston and the decision to go into Africa and not a Hollywood backlot or LA area river to do the filming.  The river and the jungle's harshly real environment made Bogart and Hepburn's performances all the better.  I could praddle on and on about why Bogart and Hepburn are so great in this film, but there are two key moments that sum it all up for me.  Both may seem unordinary overall, but say all that needs to be said about the two characters.  The first is when Rose, who has been calling (Bogart) Mr. Allnut for as long as she has known him, realizes she doesn't know his first name.  He tells her It's Charlie.  She gets a big smile on her face and repeats Charlie...that's a nice name.  Something about her demeanor when she says that displays, to me, an extraordinary joy and affection, maybe even love, for Charlie that her words perhaps do not.  Later, after Charlie and Rose have successfully navigated some white water rapids that seemed impossible to get through, Charlie grabs Rose, kisses her, and shouts Hip Hip Horray!  Again, there's something about the way Bogart does it that conveys to me the same joy, affection and love for Rose that she did earlier when repeating his name.Again, these two moments seem relatively insignificant in the context of the whole movie.  But in my opinion, they make the movie.  In this movie, as with most others, it's hard to give a damn about what characters say or do if you don't give a damn about them.  And those moments make me care about these two characters in a way that I ordinarily never would.  I shudder to think what results Bette Davis and David Niven, both fine actors, would have had with this filmThe ending of the film is, of course, implausible.  Without revealing anything, what are the odds of things happening as they did?  But who cares.  By the end, we as viewers should and would be ecstatic if Rose and Charlie were simply able to marry before their execution.  The boat ultimately blowing up and both our heroes coming out married and alive is icing on the cake.  The film ends with us knowing that despite what Keanu Reeves says, a relationship between two people who meet under extreme circumstances can work out.   Also, Robert Morley's brief performance as Rose's brother is memorable, as are most all of his performances.  And Bogart scene with the leeches is as horrifying as the same scene in Stand By Me kids is funny.

Sorry guys she`s not Scottish but I can forgive this frequent mistake because it was only recently I found out she`s English and after seeing her in BREAKING THE WAVES I was convinced she was Scottish too . It wasn`t until very recently either that I found out Stellan Skarsgard who plays Jan is the same actor who appeared in later movies like RONIN , SAVIOR and THE GLASS HOUSE .
