What it's like is a puzzle, a puzzle made of quirky, offbeat pieces, some of them with a very high degree of unreality. This viewer is not quite sure WHAT to make of it, but believes that, no doubt, it will be the kind of film that will prove to be continuously mesmerizing on repeat viewings, with elements that he may not have picked up on the first time. Jake Gyllenhaal stars as the title character, a moody, troubled high school student who starts experiencing hallucinations. Chief among them is a demonic rabbit named Frank (James Duval) who informs Donnie that the world will be coming to an end within a month. Taking place in 1988, with the Dukakis \/ Bush presidency race serving as a backdrop, this goes to great lengths to contrast the many aspects of Donnies' life. What is real? What's illusion? Certainly some viewers will have an incredible time examining all of the details and clues. Hell, even when this film is over, it's not necessarily providing a cut and dried explanation for everything. Kelly utilizes every filmmaking trick at his disposal, and does very well at keeping things suitably enigmatic. He also gets strong performances out of his interestingly chosen cast Jena Malone as Donnies' new girlfriend, Drew Barrymore (also the executive producer), Beth Grant, and Noah Wyle as teachers, Daveigh Chase and Gyllenhaals' real-life sister Maggie as Donnies' siblings, Holmes Osborne and Mary McDonnell as his parents, Katharine Ross as his psychiatrist, Patrick Swayze as a self-help guru, and Seth Rogen (in his film debut) as a thuggish schoolmate. The use of soundtrack music is eclectic, and the visual effects are a collective knockout. As a horror fan this viewer had to also enjoy a viewing of The Evil Dead within the film as a story detail. All of this is nothing if not ambitious, slowly and steadily working its way towards its conclusion, incorporating ideas such as time travel into its provocative mix. It may not be for all tastes, but it's bound to get people talking, which of course isn't exactly a bad thing. All in all, it's well worth a look for adventurous film lovers. Seven out of 10.

For me the relative innocence of 80s movies and childhood nostalgia made it a much better, if absolutely unrealistic movie. It could be seen as some sort of modern fairy tale, not be considered seriously, but with some sort of hidden meaning\/moral.I can relate to this movie because of some similar events, fears and dreams from my own life; of course like most movies, this one is exaggerated a bit, and mixes fantasy(people's dreams) with real life.This is why some 80s movies are so fun to watch, because they are absolutely unrealistic escapism and fantasy to the max, cheesy and overly optimistic as some may consider, but so is belief in God and Lord Jesus Christ, which i do share by God's grace. This may be due to a partial return to conservative and Christian values that the world had in the 80s, as a backlash against confused and crisis-ridden 70s.The film is about a family struggling with their lives after the tragic death of their father, who chose suicide instead of fighting with cancer. But no matter how hard one's life is, there is surely someone whose life is worse, so their neighbor is an alcoholic man with an autistic nephew, whose parents have died in a plane crash.While this movie is not Christian, in showing no love to or mention of God, it is similar to Jesus' second greatest commandment Love your neighbor as yourself.

But first I'll point out what I liked about both the versions.Total Recall(1990)- Of course Arnold. I felt a certain rawness in his act which I liked. He actually looked unaware of things going around, as his character required. For Sharon Stone,she was simply stunning! Enough said. The story was far ahead of it times and stands the same even today thats why it deserved a remake. This is the 2nd movie of Paul Verhoeven's direction that I have seen.(I have seen Hollowman), and his amazing work in Total Recall and Sharon Stone are the 2 reasons, I want to see Basic Instinct now. Also I liked the fact that this was one of the last movies which used miniatures,like for showing Mars planet. Bravo to the team, amazing work. Overall, an entertaining concept, performance and movie.Total Recall(2012)- I liked the major change in the original screenplay and not using idea of Mars and still keeping the same concept of the original Total Recall. Requires a lot of creativity to bring out and create something new from something which is already a blockbuster. Thats the most exciting part of this version. Of course there are scenes which are more of a tribute to the original and shot with new technology and effects. Colin Farrell is an amazing actor. I liked him in the flick 'The Recruit'(2003) and for me he was equally good in this one. Also in this movie, Colin Farrel doing a smooch scene with the director's wife(Kate Beckinsale) in front of him, requires a lot of confidence and professionalism. But Kate comes nowhere close to the charisma of Sharon Stone. Jessica Biel here stole the show. She did a good act. Len Wiseman as a director did take a risk of choosing this remake and I appreciate he came up with something like this. I liked his work in 'Die Hard 4'. This movie is not as huge hit as its predecessor, but its neither a complete washout. But personally I liked the remake and it was entertaining for me.Comparisions- I don't care why critics panned the 2012 version. Both versions were quite different in terms of execution of the same concept. Also I equally liked the sets and the ambiance created in both the movies. In the end, either ways I enjoyed the experience of Total Recall(just like Inception).

Sometimes, a person with certain skills and talents comes from the last place we'd think to find them. In the case of the main title character in Gus Van Sant's 1997 drama Good Will Hunting, Will Hunting (Matt Damon) is a gifted mathematician even though he's only a janitor at MIT. Although a mathematics teacher (Stellan Skarsgard) on campus recognizes his impressive skills, Will isn't interested in pursuing a future as a student and would rather hang out with his pals (Ben Affleck, Casey Affleck, Cole Hauser) instead. That all changes however when he gets into a fight with someone who bullied him as a kid and faces the possibility of going to jail as a result of his actions. When the teacher gets wind of this incident, he offers to bail Will out under two conditions 1) he studies mathematics under his supervision, and 2) he sees a therapist regularly. Although Will agrees to this deal, he isn't thrilled with the idea of seeing a therapist and doesn't take his first few therapists seriously. But when the teacher is able to hire his former college roommate (Robin Williams) to get through to Will, Will eventually starts to open up about his past and his current relationship with a British student (Minnie Driver) at MIT. Through their therapy sessions, they start to learn more about one another and realize that they both share important things in common. Good Will Hunting is an inspiring, if not surprising, tale about learning to plan for the road ahead and figuring out where you want to go in life.

I myself am a massive Star Wars Fan and personally enjoy watching this movie, but that being said I think there are some major problems that need to be addressed as well. So here are my pros and cons.I'm going to start with my cons first in order to get them off my chest before I get into the good stuff. This movie has several problems that practically everyone knows about and I dislike as well. First off, and most well-known, is Jar-Jar Binks. This character is the epitome of annoying stupidity, with his terrible dialect and clumsiness. I don't even have to describe why I hate this character because most of Modern Culture does it for me. He is so bad that if he wasn't in this movie at all then I would vote a 7 or even an 8. Also what I don't like about this movie is the Jake Lloyd's Anakin. The kid is such a bad portrayal of the character who would be central to the rest of the prequel trilogy. I actually think showing the Future Darth Vader as a 10 year old kid might have worked, except they only had one chance to do that, ONE CHANCE, but they got the worst kid actor on Earth to portray the said character, plus with the bad dialogue they gave the character.If they were to remake this movie, they should not only not have Jar-Jar Binks in it at all, but they should have Anakin be older. Make him Luke's age or at least have him be a teenager. There are also the Midiclorians that I cannot stand, because it essentially ruins the spiritual side of the Force and added scientific explanations to its existence. Those are the big 3 things I don't like about this movie. The things I also don't like in this movie are also the overuse of Political meetings (Only 1 or 2 are necessary), and some of the dialogue is very week. And also how C3PO is introduced is very dumb, it would have been much better to have him come from Coruscant or Naboo and already work as a protocol droid, rather than have Anakin build him as a child on Tatooine. So Yeah, that's basically what I don't like about this movie.Now here are the things I really like that this movie brought into the Star Wars franchise. First off and most obvious is the Lightsaber combat. They are very well choreographed and show the Jedi in their prime along with having them use the force to a great extent. The Lightsaber Combat in this movie and the rest of the Prequels is one of the few things that is actually better than those in the Original Trilogy. I also really like Darth Maul and the actual introduction of the Sith. I mean Palpatine and Vader were in the original trilogy, but this is the first time when we learn that the main enemy of the Jedi order is the Sith. As for Darth Maul, he is an awesome villain for this movie. He is intimidating, brutal, such an awesome presence on screen. Unfortunately he gets killed off at the end is such a dumb way where Obi Wan simply jumps up and slices him in half. If you wish to kill of such an awesome character, at least have him duel Obi Wan briefly immediately before he is sliced in half (Though he's alive in the Clone Wars Series). Also I really like the characters in the movie, well, most of them, but definitely not Jar Jar or Young Anakin. Liam Neeson was well cast for this role as an Wise but Unorthodox Jedi Master Qui Gon Jinn (one of my favorite Jedis in the Star Wars Franchise). Ewan McGregor's Obi Wan Kenobi is also a great portrayal of an already existing character in the saga. I also like Natalie Portman in her role as Padme. Its funny, when she's under the Queen Amidala guise she seems very hallow and boring, but is more interesting as a character when she is Padme. The Battle Droids in this movie are very cool as well, especially the Droidrekas. The Podracing is also pretty awesome. And finally, what I really like in this movie is the design. Every location in this movie from Naboo to Tatooine to Coruscant are very fascinating places to see on screen. They are great additions to the Star Wars Universe.So overall, I enjoy this movie, but I do have mixed feelings about it. I'm not one of those Star Wars fans who outright hates the prequels. Instead there are just things I hate about them. But to be honest of the three movies in the Prequel Trilogy, this is the one I have the most amount of problems with; it is my least favorite of the Star Wars movies. But I still like this movie overall. It is a movie you have to see from the Star Wars Saga (well all of them are, and more so than this one). If you see it at a young age, you would like this movie. But if you see it at an older age, you only might like this movie. My rating for this movie has to be C+.

First off and most obvious is the Lightsaber combat. They are very well choreographed and show the Jedi in their prime along with having them use the force to a great extent. The Lightsaber Combat in this movie and the rest of the Prequels is one of the few things that is actually better than those in the Original Trilogy. I also really like Darth Maul and the actual introduction of the Sith. I mean Palpatine and Vader were in the original trilogy, but this is the first time when we learn that the main enemy of the Jedi order is the Sith. As for Darth Maul, he is an awesome villain for this movie. He is intimidating, brutal, such an awesome presence on screen. Unfortunately he gets killed off at the end is such a dumb way where Obi Wan simply jumps up and slices him in half. If you wish to kill of such an awesome character, at least have him duel Obi Wan briefly immediately before he is sliced in half (Though he's alive in the Clone Wars Series). Also I really like the characters in the movie, well, most of them, but definitely not Jar Jar or Young Anakin. Liam Neeson was well cast for this role as an Wise but Unorthodox Jedi Master Qui Gon Jinn (one of my favorite Jedis in the Star Wars Franchise). Ewan McGregor's Obi Wan Kenobi is also a great portrayal of an already existing character in the saga. I also like Natalie Portman in her role as Padme. Its funny, when she's under the Queen Amidala guise she seems very hallow and boring, but is more interesting as a character when she is Padme. The Battle Droids in this movie are very cool as well, especially the Droidrekas. The Podracing is also pretty awesome. And finally, what I really like in this movie is the design. Every location in this movie from Naboo to Tatooine to Coruscant are very fascinating places to see on screen. They are great additions to the Star Wars Universe.So overall, I enjoy this movie, but I do have mixed feelings about it. I'm not one of those Star Wars fans who outright hates the prequels. Instead there are just things I hate about them. But to be honest of the three movies in the Prequel Trilogy, this is the one I have the most amount of problems with; it is my least favorite of the Star Wars movies. But I still like this movie overall. It is a movie you have to see from the Star Wars Saga (well all of them are, and more so than this one). If you see it at a young age, you would like this movie. But if you see it at an older age, you only might like this movie. My rating for this movie has to be C+.

I myself am a massive Star Wars Fan and personally enjoy watching this movie, but that being said I think there are some major problems that need to be addressed as well. So here are my pros and cons.I'm going to start with my cons first in order to get them off my chest before I get into the good stuff. This movie has several problems that practically everyone knows about and I dislike as well. First off, and most well-known, is Jar-Jar Binks. This character is the epitome of annoying stupidity, with his terrible dialect and clumsiness. I don't even have to describe why I hate this character because most of Modern Culture does it for me. He is so bad that if he wasn't in this movie at all then I would vote a 7 or even an 8. Also what I don't like about this movie is the Jake Lloyd's Anakin. The kid is such a bad portrayal of the character who would be central to the rest of the prequel trilogy. I actually think showing the Future Darth Vader as a 10 year old kid might have worked, except they only had one chance to do that, ONE CHANCE, but they got the worst kid actor on Earth to portray the said character, plus with the bad dialogue they gave the character.If they were to remake this movie, they should not only not have Jar-Jar Binks in it at all, but they should have Anakin be older. Make him Luke's age or at least have him be a teenager. There are also the Midiclorians that I cannot stand, because it essentially ruins the spiritual side of the Force and added scientific explanations to its existence. Those are the big 3 things I don't like about this movie. The things I also don't like in this movie are also the overuse of Political meetings (Only 1 or 2 are necessary), and some of the dialogue is very week. And also how C3PO is introduced is very dumb, it would have been much better to have him come from Coruscant or Naboo and already work as a protocol droid, rather than have Anakin build him as a child on Tatooine. So Yeah, that's basically what I don't like about this movie.Now here are the things I really like that this movie brought into the Star Wars franchise.

I've been wanting to see this for a good couple of years now, after my Dad told me about it back in about 2009, but being only 11yrs old at the time and this film being rated an 18 there was no chance my parents were going to let me watch it. But today when looking round CEX I stumbled upon it and my Mum to my surprise let me buy it. I got home and sat down with my Dad and popped it into the DVD player. With in minutes I was glued to screen, just with the intensity of them stumbling across the moors after being firmly told by the rather unfriendly locals in the pub they had just left 'The Slaughtered Lamb' to stay on the road and off the moors! Hearing noises which most would associate with a werewolf they were starting to get very on edge, turning round and starting to run back in the direction of 'The Slaughtered Lamb' the noises were getting louder and closer. After one of the two friends stumbled and fell to ground, the other friend was viciously savaged by the beast which had been creating the intimidating noises. The 'werewolf' then turned and went for the other friend who had fallen, but was shot down before he managed to savage him, only being able to take one bite of the mans flesh. I have said a lot more about what happens in the film than I normally do, just because it needed to be told, for me to then talk about the points that I want to talk about. Like I said earlier the effects aren't shocking but not great either. I have to admit I did chuckle at the attack on the moors, but not because I'm a sicko who likes seeing people getting ripped to pieces but just because of the sound effects and the werewolf itself. But that certainly doesn't make the movie a bad film because the storyline the acting and the settings around London make the film great! I loved watching this film and found it extremely enjoyable. Especially when Jack who was savaged at the beginning returns, multiple times throughout the film to haunt and warn David of events which are gonna unfold and hurt him and others around him.

He also manages to show some sensitivity, we can almost see into the pit of his dark soul, what motivates him to kill. It does't all work however, there are parts that are so illogical. Aside from the fact that the childlike main character is obsessed with violent crime. Things that would never ever happen in real life. I will have to leave it at that, if you watch the film you will spot at least one glaring example at near the end of the film. The ending will leave you with more questions than this film can answer.

My brother ended up watching ALL the Highlander sequels and told me that this one was quite clearly the best sequel.For starters this movie is not really what I call perfect. The Watchers didn't make any sense to me. I'm sorry but I really don't see the point in them. Maybe I have to watch the TV Series to make sense of them. Especially when they say the villain is a rogue.The plot of this movie is actually very good. The plot is that Duncan MacCleod finds out that his brother Connor has had a man with a 400 year old grudge against him. They decide to team up and kill him. It may sound simplistic but it is executed better than any of the other live action Highlander sequels.I did enjoy the character development of this movie. I really enjoyed the part where Duncan has to kill Connor in order for Duncan to gain enough strength to fight Jacob Kell (The antagonist). That part would have to be my favourite part out of this whole movie.So this movie does leave a lot of unanswered questions (like how immortals are still running around for starters) but I am sure that the TV Show will clear everything up. If you want to watch a good continuation of Highlander then I will suggest this to you. ","genre":null},{"date":"26 January 2013","score":"","review":" I did enjoy the original Highlander.

It uses as its pivotal moment how one woman's life splits at the missing or catching of a train and the different consequences of each event. We've all said what would have happened if... and this film opens with that premise.The film is average, although there are great performances. I love John Hannah and he's always convincing and steady whatever he plays. Gwyneth Paltrow playing the two parallel life Helens is good, not brilliant, and a little bit flat, but it was perhaps perfect for this role where she goes through quite a bit. John Lynch and Jeanne Tripplehorn (both rather wooden) and a great Zara Turner adding a few laughs as the feisty supportive best friend are the supporting cast. Whilst quite a dark film, there's a fair bit of comedy. Set in a rather sterile looking London (I've never seen the Tube look so perfect), it's an intriguing concept and is executed well, the split easily and not-improbably identified via Helen's change of hair length and colour, and so you follow the two Helen's to the conclusion implying that - like all love stories - true love (probably) triumphs no matter how bumpy the road. Like time travel films (this is a similar though a different phenomenon) there are possible loopholes that you can talk yourself around to ponder. Sliding Doors is interesting and different, and whilst it's not Shakespeare in Love (my fav Paltrow film) or anything high brow it's good entertainment and greatly thought provoking.

It seemed to be specifically crafted to set off a train of speculation and to intimidate the viewar into thinking it must be a work of genius because I don't understand it.
