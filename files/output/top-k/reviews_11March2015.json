The young guys playing the football stars were believable and well prepped. I also loved James Caan character. He seemed like a genuine college coach who had flaws, and issues along with that something that makes him who he is!. Also this was one of the very first movies I saw about college life for an inner city youth and college football shown from a darker perspective. Omar Epps character is so well thought out and that I wish we could have seen more of him, more of his highlights, a better background story. I loved the fact the kid came from the city and was big time. But at the same time, i barely felt like i was part of his big time life in high school like i think a Boobie Miles may have felt back in the same time. I understand thats Texas but you get my drift.I really liked how the kids had their own issues and families and problems displayed throughout the movie as well. It made it so much more believable, i wish they would make a revamped version where we can actually feel that Heisman race in full effect.Overall I think this is one of the best college football movies ever made, The movie should be longer to add small details, i wouldn't mind one bit. I loved it and have to give it 9 out of 10 baby! --Only because when you look at the genre of College Football\/ Football movies in general, this one actually ranks very high among the best ever in my opinion.

Fox Besides directing, Jackson also wrote the script with his regular partner and wife Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens with his girlfriend, who also was his collaborator commonplace from that work. Released in the U.S. on December 10, 2001, the film was acclaimed by critics and fans alike, especially as many of these judged the film as the most faithful adaptation of the original story of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, Jackson. It was a huge box office success, grossing over $ 870 million worldwide, and was the second highest grossing film of 2001 in the U.S. and worldwide (behind Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone). Indeed, along with The Lord of the Rings, the Harry Potter series can be regarded as another phenomenon of fantasy success worldwide.The legion of fans fans for Middle-earth and all the mystique and fanaticism around books written, could easily intimidate any renowned director to take the challenge. However, after having seen the end result of adaptation, the impression is that no one else could take over unless Peter Jackson. The director managed to keep the same characteristics of Tolkien's book, turning the three books in three epic classics of modern cinema. Not only that, but in the subsequent films, it is amazing the power of synthesis contained in adaptations. The screenplay by Jackson, Walsh and Boyens is bold, brave and respectful to the original work, but it is clear that for a few changes are necessary adaptation of the original work, so the removal or assemblage of some passages is natural in the process even more in a work so complex and detailed. Jackson said in interviews that they wanted to leave the story focused on Frodo and the Ring. Almost all the time fidelity to the book is maintained, merely to make changes that would benefit the overall film Tom Bombadil and the episode of wights certainly work in the book, but would be detrimental to the film, since it would postpone further time- key first chapter the formation of the Fellowship.Much of the success of the technique is due to the 4 sectors awarded an Oscar the visual effects, photography, makeup and soundtrack. But the film is much more than a bunch of effects. For this, the performances play a fundamental role. Elijah Wood, Sam Sean Astin, Ian McKellen, Sean Bean, Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies show always strong and fearless warriors. Christopher Lee, Billy Boyd, Dominic Monagham are as well as the comic relief of the saga, and Liv Tyler is beautiful and angelic. Cate Blanchett is the one that fails to convey the mysterious air of the most powerful and dreaded queen of the elves, but we cannot say that an interpretation is bad or detrimental to the end result of what we see.The Fellowship of the Ring is an intro movie magnificently directed by Peter Jackson. The director uses the first time to introduce the characters and various landscapes of Middle-earth to realize the dream of literature fans and get to know a primary mission to destroy the ring in the fires of Mordor Mountain where he was cast by your carrier, Frodo. Many major events were to occur in the following movies, but still, this first part we find everything action, suspense, romance, humor, adventure and even dramas.Jackson directs with incredible safety, and even with so many different times as mentioned, it leaves the narrative flowing and organic, knowing take a deserved epic tone masterfully using slow motion or situations for creating suspense, for example, by delaying the onset 's Balrog and precede the attack of orcs with sounds from a distance. It also has the merit of letting the One Ring has its own personality, able to intimidate anyone who tries to touch it and turn slowly who door. The battle scenes, the march through the mountains of the Company and the other open plans are put on a show.

Probably nobody knows exactly, even if they survived it. We can guess -- house to house, floor-to-floor, and room-to-room killing in the bombed remnants of stone and concrete shells of buildings, basements, sewers, and wreckage, throughout a large, destroyed city, hundreds of thousands of men intent on killing each other, all this going on month after month for how long -- it had to be a hellish pandemonium that defies imagination.This film tries to bring us into that pandemonium. To an amazing degree, it succeeds. Maybe not everything shown is accurate. But many scenes ring true enough. More than one source has claimed that Russian Army punishment was severe for retreating soldiers, and that families were threatened if their son got captured, or surrendered. We know some of the Volga crossings were bloodbaths, as were clashes throughout the ruined downtown. The bombings, the shelling, the snipers, the civilian and military life driven into and under the rubble, we know these things happened. This movie brings us there, in so much detail, you can't get it all in one viewing. The sets are simply amazing.Along with all that great stuff, Jude Law is cute, and same for Rachel Weisz (somehow she defied the odds and grew even more beautiful 11 years later in the Bourne Legacy).So what's missing? Well, the writing could be better. Jean-Jacques Annaud made his first (and apparently only) try at feature screen writing in this film. Why they let him do that, who knows. What couldn't a real writer do with this material? Stalingrad was the the mother of hell on earth! The Nazis were in a mortal drive to the Caspian oil fields. And the legendary Russian snipers! The film brings us Vassily Zaitsev, a real life legendary shooter. Why stop with him? Some of the best Russian WWII snipers were beautiful young women! The lovely, 19-year-old Ludmilla Pavilchenko (over 300 kills) was honored -- while the war was raging -- in London and Washington, even receiving gifts of a 1911 Colt and a Winchester rifle at the White House, before she returned to the war. Another sweet young killer, Roza Shanina, had 54 confirmed kills. It gets even more perfect Vassily perfected a system of snipers working in threes. You want a story, maybe with a love triangle? The drama practically writes itself. Annaud does put one young woman sniper in the action (played by the lovely Austrian Sophie Rois), but her role is horrible, and short -- she knows how to work her trade in a bombed-out rubble of a department store, but when a wave of German bombers flies over, she panics and runs out into the Nazi shooting gallery.The story a love triangle. Smart guy makes a good try, but loses pretty brilliant girl to honest farm boy. But it doesn't hold interest, with the exception of a great love scene. Subplot 11-year old becomes a double agent, somehow passing from the German-occupied rubble mounds to the Russian-held sewers and basements pretty much every day, never even getting very dirty!

Following a highly successful career in the 1950's and 60's, Kurosawa fell out of favour with modern audiences and producers due to his traditional film-making styles and topics. Japan had experienced it's own New Wave, where directors used innovative techniques to look forward, rather than looking back. Eventually backed by Sidney Lumet, Kurosawa developed his labour of love, based on Shakespeare's King Lear, and made Kagemusha (1980) - a 'warm-up' for Ran - while developing the project. He storyboarded every scene with beautiful artwork, ensured that every costume was made by hand, and even built a castle to torch it down for the movie. On top of this, his wife passed away during filming (Kurosawa took only one day off work to mourn), and by the film's completion, Kurosawa was almost completely blind.Such dedication and rigorous planning doesn't always work out, but Ran is Kurosawa's final masterpiece. The term 'epic' is thrown around far too often these days, but if one film could really be labelled as epic, it is Ran. Epic in scale, length and scope, it's a complex, exciting and bloody movie, capturing the tragedy of Shakespeare's play, and invigorating with it's Machiavellian intrigue. The ageing warlord Hidetora Ichimonji (Tatsuya Nakadai) decides to pass his throne to his eldest son Taro (Akira Terao) so he can spend his remaining years in peace. To his other sons, Jiro (Jinpachi Nezu) and the youngest Saburo (Daisuke Ryu), he leaves two large castles. Saburu objects, calling the decision folly and foreseeing instability, and is banished by his father for his loyalty.Before Taro's backside has warmed his new throne, his wife Lady Kaede (Mieko Harada) is whispering doubts into his ear. With Hidetora still residing in the castle, Lady Kaede tells Taro that his crown is hollow and his men will never earn his respect until his father is removed. After Hidetora kills one of Jiro's men who was about to kill his fool Kyoami (Funeral Parade of Roses' (1964) Pita), Jiro banishes his father, who then seeks refuge with Jiro. But Jiro has plans of his own, and seeing Taro as a weak leader, pretends to side with Taro in preparation for a future betrayal, and also sends Hidetora packing. With nowhere to turn, the broken and increasingly senile old man wanders to the ruins of a castle he conquered in his warmongering days. But when Saburo hears of his brothers' betrayal and Lady Kaede's scheming, war begins to brew.Kurosawa's precise planning pays off, as Ran is a gorgeous canvas of colours and scenery, to the extent that any scene could be paused, printed and hung on the wall as a piece of art. The costumes, a sumptuous blend of red's and yellow's, bring the battle scenes to life. Bodies litter the ground, streaming with bright red blood that give the movie a grim and apocalyptic feel, and when juxtaposed with Hidetora's mental decline, makes it feel like the world is literally crumbling around him. The acting is surprisingly subtle and subdued, especially when compared to Kurosawa's earlier works. Nakadai is outstanding as the lost old man, though he is helped by some impressive make-up, but the film belongs to Harada, whose ruthless conniving truly embodies Shakespeare's text.

Peter Jackson opted to set his 2005 epic during the 1930s, when the original classic was filmed. The retro setting is true to the original story and lends the film a sense of fairytale fantasy disconnect. KING KONG (1976) brings the adventure up-to-date, into the world right outside the viewers' windows.Instead of location shooting for a Hollywood film, the crew in this version comes to the mysterious island on behalf of an oil company, led by Charles Grodin's opportunistic capitalist character.

","genre":"Adventure, Fantasy, Horror"},{"date":"11 March 2015","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" As I said in my review of Laurence Olivier's 1955 film version, Richard III is my least favourite of the Shakespearean plays with which I am familiar as I don't think that its language and exploration of themes are on the same level as his best work such as Hamlet or Macbeth. When it came to the Olivier film, I think that he forgot that he was a great actor and director while he was making it as his performance is too over the top and hammy and his direction is pedestrian. He failed to live up to the high standards that he set for himself on both fronts in Henry V and Hamlet. Thankfully, this is a far, far superior version which has served to increase my appreciation for the play. As with most Shakespearean films, it makes changes to the play, the Bard's longest after Hamlet. It only incorporates about half of the text, conflates several characters, cuts out others and reorders some of the events. At only 100 minutes, it's a very fast paced film.Of the eight Shakespearean films that I have watched this year, this is the first in which the lead actor was not also the director. However, Ian McKellen did play another important behind the scenes role as he and the director Richard Loncraine wrote the screenplay. Loncraine does a wonderful job in the director's chair. The film has a great atmosphere and I love the cinematography. The film takes place in an alternate history fascist version of 1930s Britain. This is an excellent creative decision as Richard's rise to and consolidation of power is highly reminiscent of the Night of the Long Knives and, on the other end of the political spectrum, Stalin's Show Trials, given that he frequently uses trumped up charges to get his enemies out of his way. In the visual sense, many of the costumes are obviously based on Nazi uniforms and the scene in which Richard's accession is announced looks like something out of Triumph des Willens. On an even simpler level, Richard has a moustache! In reality, Elizabeth Woodville belonged to a minor aristocratic family and was the first commoner to become queen. In the film, she is depicted as an American socialite reminiscent of Wallis Simpson and she and her brother Lord Rivers are looked down on because of it.As the title character, Ian McKellen is absolutely remarkable. While Olivier's Richard was too obviously villainous, McKellen portrays him as a Machiavellian manipulator who skilfully moves all of the pieces into place to secure his accession to the throne without ever tipping his hand. He uses guile and subtlety to achieve his ends, playing the role of a loving brother to Edward IV and Clarence and a loving uncle to Edward V and the Duke of York. As in real life, it's not the villains who wear black hats and twirl their moustaches that you have to worry about; it's the one who take a more subtle approach, at least initially. In private, however, he relishes his status as a villain, delivering his soliloquies to the camera with a smirk. He even jumps for joy after he asks the Lady Anne, the widow of Henry VI's son the Prince of Wales whom he murdered days earlier, to marry him.The film has a very strong cast overall. After McKellen, I thought that the strongest performer was Annette Bening as his sister-in-law Elizabeth Woodville, who has a large role in the film as opposed to the character's fleeting appearances in the Olivier version. She is a very strong woman who, in one of the film's best scenes, openly accuses Richard of murder and refuses to allow her daughter Elizabeth to marry him. Bening is more than a match for McKellen in their scenes together. Another strong female character is Richard's mother the Duchess of York, whose role is merged with Henry VI's widow Queen Margaret. She grows to despise her son as the film progresses and his villainy becomes all the more apparent. I have to admit that I've never thought of Maggie Smith as highly as I think of other British actresses of her generation such as Judi Dench, Vanessa Redgrave or Glenda Jackson but she is excellent in the film. Kristin Scott Thomas has less screen time but she excels in the aforementioned scene in which Richard proposes to her, delivering a wonderfully understated performance in contrast to Claire Bloom's caterwauling in the 1955 film. Jim Broadbent, in particular, and Tim McInnerny were cast against type as Richard's lackeys Buckingham and Catesby but they're both very good. Nigel Hawthorne is downright brilliant as Clarence, who is blind to his brother's true nature until it is far too late. He particularly excels in his monologue in the rain on the roof of the Tower of London. John Wood is excellent as the easily manipulated king Edward IV who trusts the wrong brother. One thing that is quite funny about the film is that Maggie Smith plays McKellen, Hawthorne and Wood's mother in spite of the fact that she is not only a mere five years older than McKellen but five years younger than Hawthorne and four years younger than Wood! Bill Paterson, Donald Sumpter, Jim Carter and Edward Hardwicke (whose father Cedric played Edward IV in the 1955 version) are all very effective in comparatively small roles. The weakest link acting wise is Robert Downey, Jr. I don't think that Shakespeare is really his forte but he's quite good. It's certainly not a disaster on the same level as Keanu Reeves' performance in Much Ado About Nothing.Overall, this is a brilliant film which offers fresh insight into both a 400 year old play and some of the worst moments of the 20th Century. It's a shame that McKellen and Bening didn't receive Oscar nominations for Best Actor and Best Actress.

This is the movie my grandparents always exclaimed over and finally fangirled in their own way when I told them I had finally watched it. This is the story of a man who started out as a relatively happy person as an American living in Paris. He then, like in most movies, finds a pretty girl whom he comes to adore. But her secret past ends up coming into play and he finds himself alone on the train station leaving France to Morocco.

While several of these film adaptations were very good, Stephen King is a fan of very few of them. So to determine whether or not he should never allow another film adaptation, he decided to direct a film based on one of his own stories. Maximum Overdrive is based on a short story titled Trucks, featured in his short story collection, Night Shift. In the trailer, he said that he wanted to see someone do Stephen King right. Several years later, he confessed that it was a moron film. Should Stephen King be that ashamed of directing this movie? Not necessary. Sure, it's complicated, it's twisted, and none of these supernatural trucks are explained very well. And sure, Stephen King probably has more to hate about this film than having to play the guy who gets called an a-hole by an ATM machine.

It is a timeless movie filled with romance, drama, and the occasional witty line. Bogart and Bergman have an electric chemistry and just look well together overall. Although they do not end up together in the end, Ilsa (Bergman) and Rick (Bogart) share a romance on screen that truly shows that if you love something set it free. Rick risks it all to help the woman he once loved, and still probably does love. Aside from the romantic relationships, the friendship that binds Rick and Captain Louis Renault (Rains) appears genuine. They are two men who become entwined with due to unfortunate circumstances and what becomes of them after the film is something that I personally would like to know about.
