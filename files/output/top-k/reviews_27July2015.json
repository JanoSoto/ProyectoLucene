This small portion of music is powerful in that it conveys exactly the tone of the movie we know collectively as an audience that this will be an upsetting story which takes place in a fairly innocent location &#x96; Minnesota.Why is this film titled Fargo, exactly? It is where everything is set into motion. The William H. Macy character (Lundegaard) drives up there to meet the two villains of the story who he employs to kidnap his wife so that they may con money from his wife's father. We don't know this right away, however; in fact, the information we're told is only certain bits, so we cannot fathom how simple this rather complex plan really is at first. Making the situation complex for the viewer, however, lets us know that anything can and will go wrong &#x96; and what do you know, it does.While Frances McDormand may be the protagonist of the story, let's talk first about the best talent in this film &#x96; William H Macy. After watching this film, without knowledge of the show Shameless, I doubt anybody could predict this actor would be a good fit for Frank Gallagher in Shameless &#x96; stubborn as hell, alcoholic, selfish, terrible father, anything but respectable. In Fargo, Macy portrays Lundegaard with perfect execution, a role on the opposite pole of his iconic Frank Gallagher. Lundegaard is a first time criminal, and it shows through the fact that he is an every-day-nice-guy, not very outspoken, and holds in his anger so much that he explodes when he needs to let it out. Macy tackles the overall nervousness of the character so well that he develops perfect mannerisms for the character &#x96; looking down due to shyness frequently, moments of losing control that are just right and not overly dramatic, stuttering, and a stupid smile to retain his innocence despite the horrific plot he carries out, putting his family in danger time and time again. Macy's portrayal is arguably the best performance of the film, yet he lost the best supporting Oscar to none other than Cuba Gooding Jr's role in Jerry Maguire that year.Another strong aspect of the film is the character played by Steve Buscemi. Everybody thinks it, and the Coen brothers say it time and time again in their script Steve Buscemi sure is a funny-looking fellow. This is brought up at least twice by witnesses in the case &#x96; one prostitute and one bartender, who act as substitutes for the audience, the voyeur, the cinephile who observes and comments, but does not contribute much to the actual story. Buscemi's character is egotistical, funny, filled with rage; he is given authority which he does not deserve as Shep, who put Lundegaard in contact with Buscemi's friend, did not vouch for the Buscemi character. Buscemi is the comic relief to his counter part's scary, more dominating and menacing presence &#x96; he is a giant compared to Buscemi and does not talk unless it has to do with the job they have set out to do. This seems to be one of the only reasons Buscemi has to do practically everything &#x96; he goes alone on the actual exchange of the money and Mrs. Lundegaard, leaving only him to have to deal with the near- fatal surprise in store for him. He returns with the money for his partner (though he does not tell him there is much more buried in the middle of nowhere) and he rightfully complains that Gaear did not suffer an injury like him, though his deception is greedy and egotistical. It turns out that Gaear has a greedy nature too, possibly much greedier than Carl (Buscemi) since he thinks a sum of only eighty thousand dollars is involved and his reaction is very extreme.Then we have Frances McDormand, playing Marge Gunderson, the protagonist who does not show up until thirty minutes into the film. If it were not for the presence of this character in the film, this movie would be an extremely depressing story. Marge represents the average Minnesota citizen who finds happiness with the simplicity of family life. She serves the police force as she serves her family &#x96; she is the sole breadwinner for her and her husband Norm, and she is pregnant, yet embarks on this mysterious, dangerous journey to find two murderers in order to put them behind bars. Her short speech to Gaear towards the end of the film is exactly what the film needs &#x96; it is reassurance that we are not alone in this world when we don't understand the evil behind greed which drives people to do the most awful things and strive so far from morality. One final comment is that I love the presence of the character Mike Yanagita in this film. Most people would find this character to simply be a comic relief character, but as my brother pointed out, the fact that he lied about his life and was so convincing about it drives Marge to return to Lundegaard, who appeared to be just as innocent as Mike on the surface. To be honest, I thought this character was simple comic relief on first impression, but this didn't make too much sense to me since it did not drive the story further if that was the case, and I knew the Coen brothers are considered great filmmakers.I very strongly recommend this film to all viewers who are comfortable with watching an R-rated film it is simply one of the greatest dark comedies\/crime dramas ever made.

Do not be put off by any of the trailers you might have seen on YouTube, or anywhere else for that matter, where the picture is very blurred. Whoever is responsible for the re-mastering of this up-to-date version has done a very good job, especially when you take into consideration that it is now 65 years since it was first released on old film stock.If you happen to have a multi-media Blu-ray drive in your PC, you will be pleasantly surprised, as I was, at the sharpness of the picture. Watching it on a HD TV the picture quality does drop slightly, but that is to be expected, especially when you are further away from the screen. There is no hint of any scratches or anything else untoward throughout the entire film. So all in all, a well deserved bonus to the rating is provided just for that. The sound has also been given the treatment and has been upgraded to DTS master audio\/mono, but frankly that is personally not as important to me as the picture quality.As to the film itself. We have James 'Jimmy' Stewart in the role of Elwood P. Dowd, that he stated he enjoyed playing on stage (from all accounts there was a 6 month run in London), before taking it to the silver screen. He also stated that it was his personal all time favourite film that he was involved with. It was certainly a unique role for Jimmy.

But how will they persuade them to help, and can they trust them to honour the agreement ?I reckon this is probably my favourite American western (though Rio Bravo, made at the same time, is almost as good) - it's just solid rip-roaring fun from start to finish, features the greatest cast of cowboys ever assembled, is a brilliant story filled with terrific themes and fascinating archetypes and is beautifully shot, cut and scored throughout. Every boy looking for heroes, role models, men to aspire to be like, should watch it, but at the same time it's sad, thoughtful, tender, even pessimistic. Unlike many westerns it never glorifies violence, celebrates greed, demonises ethnic groups, or deals in clichés. It's as stylish a movie as you could find, yet the drama plays as powerfully as any highbrow play. The gunslingers all have their own reasons for being there, but few are altruistic or noble, and the villagers tolerate their presence purely for services rendered. When Chico (Buchholz) tries to crow, the others don't spare him their bitter wisdom, and when the kids attempt to lionise O'Reilly (Bronson) at the cost of their fathers, he quickly puts them in their place. The main theme of redemption is almost existential; Calvera's dying words expressing his incomprehension as to why they would risk their lives for such scant reward. And yet it's joyous fun throughout, filled with funny dialogue (Bronson's first line is for my money the best opener in cinema), amusing scenes (McQueen's dinner table face pulling), great shootouts and chases, an absolutely barnstorming score by Elmer Bernstein (arguably his best in a career filled with classics) and gorgeous desert locations in Morelos State. But perhaps its greatest asset is its fantastic cast; everybody is great, right down to the lowest part - they look mythic, they deliver fabulous performances, they feel authentic and when they suffer we are truly moved. Very few actors don't look foolish with wide brimmed hats, gun belts and spurs, yet everyone here is iconic. Brynner is perhaps the greatest man-in-black cowboy in all cinema (ironically he was Russian), Wallach is simply terrific as the shrewd calculating bandito, McQueen is the coolest sidekick in any western (So far so good !), Bronson and Coburn are the epitome of tough guys and even Buchholz (who was German) is somehow wrong-but-right as the loudmouthed Chico. The film's writing credits are a little controversial - the original script was by Walter Bernstein, then largely rewritten by Walter Newman (neither of whom were credited for different reasons) and adapted by William Roberts. Newman is acknowledged as the main author, although of course the movie is almost a straight remake of Akira Kurosawa's 1954 classic Shichinin No Samurai \/ Seven Samurai, with only the setting changed. It's a very rare example of a cross-cultural remake which is every bit as good as the original. Beautifully shot from start to finish by the great cinematographer Charles Lang (The Uninvited, How The West Was Won, Wait Until Dark), originally this was neither popular nor acclaimed in the US but has deservedly become recognised as one of the greatest westerns of all time.

It's a very rare example of a cross-cultural remake which is every bit as good as the original.

But how will they persuade them to help, and can they trust them to honour the agreement ?I reckon this is probably my favourite American western (though Rio Bravo, made at the same time, is almost as good) - it's just solid rip-roaring fun from start to finish, features the greatest cast of cowboys ever assembled, is a brilliant story filled with terrific themes and fascinating archetypes and is beautifully shot, cut and scored throughout. Every boy looking for heroes, role models, men to aspire to be like, should watch it, but at the same time it's sad, thoughtful, tender, even pessimistic. Unlike many westerns it never glorifies violence, celebrates greed, demonises ethnic groups, or deals in clichés. It's as stylish a movie as you could find, yet the drama plays as powerfully as any highbrow play. The gunslingers all have their own reasons for being there, but few are altruistic or noble, and the villagers tolerate their presence purely for services rendered. When Chico (Buchholz) tries to crow, the others don't spare him their bitter wisdom, and when the kids attempt to lionise O'Reilly (Bronson) at the cost of their fathers, he quickly puts them in their place. The main theme of redemption is almost existential; Calvera's dying words expressing his incomprehension as to why they would risk their lives for such scant reward. And yet it's joyous fun throughout, filled with funny dialogue (Bronson's first line is for my money the best opener in cinema), amusing scenes (McQueen's dinner table face pulling), great shootouts and chases, an absolutely barnstorming score by Elmer Bernstein (arguably his best in a career filled with classics) and gorgeous desert locations in Morelos State. But perhaps its greatest asset is its fantastic cast; everybody is great, right down to the lowest part - they look mythic, they deliver fabulous performances, they feel authentic and when they suffer we are truly moved.

My family contains two other Hitch collectors and nobody has this in their collection. I have 39 steps and The Lady Vanishes, Foreign Correspondent. This movie is simply boring beyond belief. There is a reason this was one of Hitch's worst box office performers. Since then, it has become a Rorshach test for people's projective values into the movie. They see so much; I am sorry, Freud said projection is almost an unavoidable human failing. When I read so many of these, really it is inside of you not the movie. The narrative is straight forward a man commissions Stewart to watch his wife, Kim Novak, because she is acting crazy. She seems to be transforming into some woman in a painting. The movie follows Stewart tooling about following her. This is the central flaw in the movie. Long periods of the movie are Stewart driving here and there first following the putative wife, after she appears to have jumped off the building, he follows a look alike that he inadvertently runs into. She has red not blond hair but her face is a dead ringer for the dead wife he failed to protect. He is publicly humiliated at a hearing though exonerated criminally. The endless following, which consumes the movie is why the title is a misnomer. Stewart's vertigo while important is not the bulk of the movie Obsession that is what the movie is about.From the beginning, intelligent viewers suspect the man who hires Stewart, the sight of her suicide being so congruent with his weakness, trust me, you will figure out halfway through this bore fest what is going on right away. In my living room, guys were yelling out,Yeah, he hired him cause he's up there with the dead wife already, come on. Do not let the movie's length fool you, it feels like Ben Hur only slower. Hitch was a genius but all great men make mistakes this is Hitch's greatest one followed later by The Trouble With Harry. All three of the Hitch collectors, in my family, got this in a multi Hitch Blu Ray collection and all three of us threw it away. Boring like no other Hitch movie, devoid of action except at the beginning and ending; it is one long following a woman all about town. Shadow Of A Doubt I consider to be his best, better than the more acclaimed Psycho or Rear Window; that is slow but there is more going on under the surface than Stewart driving all over town following the two women.This is why it bombed at the box office. In the movie Hitchcock, when Alfred proposes Psycho, the executives first words are,Is this going to be another Vertigo? You know, where we lost our shirts? Some of Hitch's earlier movies, like Foreign Correspondent or Jamaica Inn, have slow parts this is a slow movie with tiny scenes of action. You will likely be asleep by then. My review is easy Do you really not enjoy Hitchcock? Disliked some of his films? Do not watch the movie. If you adore every Hitch give it a try but do not say I didn't warn you.

There are a lot of theories about this movie. It is clear that she brings the Birds to begin their attacks when she is returning on the boat. Some think it is her sexual aggressiveness towards Taylor which was taboo during this cultural period. Hitch often punishes promiscuous women in his movies. An opposing theory is that she has birds imprisoned within a cage as a gift for Mitch and this sets off the attacks. Who Knows? It is something to think about when you watch it promiscuity or bird team spirit? I like the film, it has a great cast Taylor, Tandy, Pleshette and Tippie. My main problem, besides Tippi's shaky acting is that it simply did not scare me much. Birds just are not that terrifying; Hitch does what he can. He has characters turning their backs on single birds, then finding hundreds a few minutes later. I guess people who are more frightened of birds might find the movie more terrifying. There are plenty of scenes of birds chasing and biting kids, people and ramming windows. I must be honest; it didn't make my heart beat terribly faster.Tippi, while pretty, was always a very poor actress. This is much better than Marnie where she is alone with Connery. Here Taylor and Tandy hold her up much more. I still found her performance quite unbelievable at times. It will keep your interest but do not go in expecting Psycho because it is not very scary. Once the attacks begin, the action is claustrophobically confined to inside the house or diner. This intensifies Tippi's shaky acting. Also, thematically, you can hear them outside but not much happens; it gets a trifle boring. Hitch does what he can with the movie; I just found the whole concept a bit silly. When I saw this, in an audience, in a retro theater, people were laughing when it was supposed to be serious. This is one of the most infallible tests for a thriller that is failing. The diner scene evoked laughter even the kids being chased with the birds landing and taking a bite did not play well in my audience.

It features plenty of long scenes where actors portraying professional singers sing dreadfully, over- singing, forcing every. single. note. As someone who sings myself, this aspect really pulls me out of Nashville. For a movie that is famously about Nashville, it finds more joy in soul and folk music than in country. The film's heart is a scene which contrasts a sincere and moving folk performance by Keith Carradine with a terrific and sad scene where Gwen Welles' realises she had been hired to strip instead of for her singing ability. The song featured in this scene It Don't Worry Me became a hit apparently. There's also the opening scene which contrasts a pair of recording sessions a lively gospel one + bad singing by the charming Lily Tomlin with a cold propagandistic country session with Henry Gibson.Its rough as guts, with some scenes set-pieces such as the airport scene early on seeming carefully choreographed, but all the acting has the loose improvisational style common to both Altman and Cassavetes films, which you either love or hate. I tend to find the actors higher calibre in Cassavetes, so Altman sometimes grates on me. Nashville is famous as a trope-originator for Altman's sprawling long films that are broader than they are deep, sort of like Love Actually, where you don't get a full Sleepless in Seattle thing, you get a bunch of tiny versions of it. Here, you get a bunch of musical bio-pics in one, but here there's no attempt to give each the same arc like in Love Actually, its more in Altman's slice of life style. Its absolutely a landmark film, there's not many others like it, and it is entertaining. Your mileage may vary with how picky you are about actors being cast as singers and having several protracted singing scenes that are often squirm-inducing, yet you get the feeling they weren't supposed to be. I've got it on VHS and don't love it enough to upgrade. I've watched my VHS copy twice and have grown attached to its pan and scan ugliness. For me its a picture I like and find fascinating, plus an extra point for being so unique, so 8\/10.

I've got it on VHS and don't love it enough to upgrade. I've watched my VHS copy twice and have grown attached to its pan and scan ugliness. For me its a picture I like and find fascinating, plus an extra point for being so unique, so 8\/10.

Seriously, this is just plain bad. But, as bad as this is, it's still funny. This isn't like Batman & Robin awful, but it's pretty bad. Anyway, this film completely throws out nearly everything Burton had accomplished. Batman had become synonymous with dark and brooding, both the character and the stories. The character of Batman is still dark and brooding, as he is now played by Val Kilmer, who does an adequate job. Sure, he's stiff, but at least he delivers an okay performance, and even seems to be genuinely good in a few scenes here and there with Robin. Speaking of Robin, Chris O'Donnell plays Dick Grayson, orphaned circus acrobat turned crime fighter, Robin. Now, the thing is, I actually kind of like his character. Robin's just a like able character, he's young, he's headstrong, and he livens things up a bit. The problem I have with Robin is that the movie's never sure if they want to have him be a funny guy, or another brooding vigilante. He changes in the middle of scenes, and it's really hard to get invested in his character. However, when he does get to portray a damaged young man, he does pretty good. Michael Gough still delivers a good performance as Alfred, despite the quality of the script. And then... there are the villains. Now, I can't lie, watching Jim Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones overacting so much in a movie, is very entertaining. But... those two as Riddler and Two-Face? No way. First of all, Jim Carrey goes way too far over the top. Sure, it's funny, but that's not how the Riddler should be. At least not how I understand the character. And Tommy Lee Jones, though entertaining while screaming 'BLAST 'IM' at the top of his lungs, is utterly wasted. He's a great actor, and I can only imagine how good he would be as a villain in a good Batman movie. Oh, and I can't forget Nicole Kidman as Chase Meridian, the psychologist who's into Batman, not Bruce Wayne. She somehow manages to turn a Batman movie into both a romance movie, and stupid psycho babble, which is really impressive when you think about it. While I expressed issues with Tim Burton's directing in my reviews for his Batman movies, Schumacher decided Batman needed all the garish colors and bizarre buildings he could throw onto the screen, and wants the whole thing to be a comedy routine apparently. Also, I can't even get into the action really. I remember when I first saw Batman with having no knowledge prior aside from the Adam West movie, I was like 'Wow! This is great! It's so much more realistic than the other superhero movies, it's about physically normal people!' Well, something like that. The point is, this movie throws realism out the window. Oh, and remember how Michael Keaton would get into some pretty cool fights with the goons in the previous movies. Val Kilmer just kind of spins around, and people fall over all around him. Two-Face doesn't even get a real fight with him! Speaking of Two-Face fights, why did the final battle with him just involve Robin punching him in the face and him falling backwards. Seriously, just repeat that, and then you have the fight. That would've worked as the finisher to the fight, but the whole thing? No! Anyway, if you can enjoy a movie just because of how over the top and bad it is, than you should absolutely watch this movie. For that purpose, it's great!

Ward is very much a by the book agent, Anderson knows that by the book won't help them in their dealings with the locals. The growing relationship between both men is very interesting to watch.The pair face strong opposition from the local community, especially from the police and the mayor. The strongest sources of opposition are Sheriff Ray Stuckey(Gailard Sartain)and Deputy Sheriff Clinton Bell(Brad Dourif).Anderson and Ward soon discover that Stuckey and many of the others they encounter are members of the local branch of the Ku Klux Klan, they also come to realise that any black people they talk to face violent attacks from the Klan if they speak to the FBI. The bodies of the missing activists are discovered and from then on it becomes a murder investigation.Whilst Ward tries to fight by the book Anderson takes the law into his own hands and dishes out violence to Deputy Bell and others. Anderson also receives useful information from Deputy Bell's terrified wife (Frances McDormand), she risks her own life because she knows that what is happening in her town is wrong.The entire cast are excellent.

Nolan manages to make this ride incredibly special by using a very interesting and effective method, which was to tweak the screenplay in a way which will ensure that the viewer is allowed as much exposition as the protagonist himself. We are never allowed too much exposition and the result is a fascinating film that messes with the viewer, no matter how many times he\/she chooses to watch it.First and foremost, Memento is a technical masterpiece. The non- linear screenplay, the editing, the cinematography and the direction of each and every scene is just pitch perfect. Nolan messes with the viewer in the same way that other characters mess with Lenny to take advantage of him and make use of his medical condition. 'Memento' demands constant and uninterrupted attention from the viewer, otherwise he\/she could easily slip into a state of total confusion as the film is pretty much a puzzle which the viewer has to solve along with Lenny. The non- linear screenplay written by Christopher Nolan based on a short story written by his brother includes two major sections going side by side simultaneously. One section shown in black and white runs in chronological order, while the other section shown in colour runs in reverse order, both the sections move towards each other in time- line throughout the film. They meet right at the end to create a shocking climax to the film. A screenplay as complex as this would have been unimaginably difficult to conceive and execute, but Nolan astonishingly managed to write it and his directorial skills made the constant transitions from one section to the other absolutely seamless. It takes a lot of guts to write and direct a film like this, and when it's only your 2nd major film, the stakes get even higher and Nolan passed the test with flying colours.The major theme of the film is memory and the subjective(at times) nature of it. We all have certain memories, whose significance, meanings and implications change with time as we gain maturity or as we become aware of other things. In a way, this subjective nature of memory and the whole concept of choosing to remember certain aspects of an incident to derive a specific meaning out of it is dealt with in the most intense and cerebral way in this film. There are some reviews I have read where the reviewers have complained that maybe the non-linear,complex screenplay of the film is the only thing that keeps 'Memento' from being just a puzzle and a standard, ordinary revenge film. I have two arguments against that complaint. Firstly, this film had to have the complex screenplay as Nolan wanted the viewer to experience the same mental inadequacies that Lenny experiences and he wanted the viewer to feel lost at times during the film just like Lenny. Secondly, the film ends in a way which completely changed my perception of it. The ending makes the whole film a tangential metaphor for general existentialism. The film becomes much deeper by conveying that many people will believe in something just to make their lives worth living and give themselves a motivation to go on living in their quest for what they choose to believe, which can be very relevant from the angle of belief in religion and a higher power.Although Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano come up with good supporting performances, but 'Memento' is Guy Pearce's film. He drives the film forward from the beginning right till the end. He becomes the character Lenny and comes up with a brilliantly convincing performance. He juggles understatement with bursts of intensity beautifully to create the character on screen.'Memento' was the first Nolan masterpiece and this was the film that made his name. It is much deeper than some people think it is. No matter who you are and how many times you've watched this, 'Memento' will always find a way to keep you transfixed with its mystery and subtle reticence and it lingers in the mind for days and encourages discussions due to the openness of the storyline. It is always immensely re-watchable due to its style. This belongs to the Essential Viewing category.

It takes a lot of guts to write and direct a film like this, and when it's only your 2nd major film, the stakes get even higher and Nolan passed the test with flying colours.The major theme of the film is memory and the subjective(at times) nature of it. We all have certain memories, whose significance, meanings and implications change with time as we gain maturity or as we become aware of other things. In a way, this subjective nature of memory and the whole concept of choosing to remember certain aspects of an incident to derive a specific meaning out of it is dealt with in the most intense and cerebral way in this film. There are some reviews I have read where the reviewers have complained that maybe the non-linear,complex screenplay of the film is the only thing that keeps 'Memento' from being just a puzzle and a standard, ordinary revenge film. I have two arguments against that complaint. Firstly, this film had to have the complex screenplay as Nolan wanted the viewer to experience the same mental inadequacies that Lenny experiences and he wanted the viewer to feel lost at times during the film just like Lenny. Secondly, the film ends in a way which completely changed my perception of it. The ending makes the whole film a tangential metaphor for general existentialism. The film becomes much deeper by conveying that many people will believe in something just to make their lives worth living and give themselves a motivation to go on living in their quest for what they choose to believe, which can be very relevant from the angle of belief in religion and a higher power.Although Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano come up with good supporting performances, but 'Memento' is Guy Pearce's film. He drives the film forward from the beginning right till the end. He becomes the character Lenny and comes up with a brilliantly convincing performance. He juggles understatement with bursts of intensity beautifully to create the character on screen.'Memento' was the first Nolan masterpiece and this was the film that made his name. It is much deeper than some people think it is. No matter who you are and how many times you've watched this, 'Memento' will always find a way to keep you transfixed with its mystery and subtle reticence and it lingers in the mind for days and encourages discussions due to the openness of the storyline. It is always immensely re-watchable due to its style. This belongs to the Essential Viewing category.

Nolan manages to make this ride incredibly special by using a very interesting and effective method, which was to tweak the screenplay in a way which will ensure that the viewer is allowed as much exposition as the protagonist himself. We are never allowed too much exposition and the result is a fascinating film that messes with the viewer, no matter how many times he\/she chooses to watch it.First and foremost, Memento is a technical masterpiece. The non- linear screenplay, the editing, the cinematography and the direction of each and every scene is just pitch perfect. Nolan messes with the viewer in the same way that other characters mess with Lenny to take advantage of him and make use of his medical condition. 'Memento' demands constant and uninterrupted attention from the viewer, otherwise he\/she could easily slip into a state of total confusion as the film is pretty much a puzzle which the viewer has to solve along with Lenny. The non- linear screenplay written by Christopher Nolan based on a short story written by his brother includes two major sections going side by side simultaneously. One section shown in black and white runs in chronological order, while the other section shown in colour runs in reverse order, both the sections move towards each other in time- line throughout the film. They meet right at the end to create a shocking climax to the film. A screenplay as complex as this would have been unimaginably difficult to conceive and execute, but Nolan astonishingly managed to write it and his directorial skills made the constant transitions from one section to the other absolutely seamless.

Cloning of humans is illegal and, for Gibson, discovering his clone is potentially bad news for both Gibson and his family as it means that the secret that they're trying to protect could end up becoming common knowledge. The organisation responsible for cloning Gibson will do everything in their power to protect their secret even if it means killing Gibson and his family.As a concept, this is very interesting and it's the sort of film that provides you with a nice piece of escapism. The subject matter of cloning humans is ripe for all kinds of social commentary - would you want another chance at living again after you've died or would you just rather die naturally and let your loved ones mourn you and leave your memories with them? Although the cloning aspect is a forerunner for the film I did like the idea that one aspect of the film showed someone who didn't want to be cloned - yes it's too far-fetched to be taken seriously (it's science fiction after all), but it does make you think whilst the film is running.As with most Arnie films, this one is very entertaining and lots of fun. Hank and his virtual girlfriend, the virtual lawyer and the virtual psychiatrist - all these characters were only in the film for a short period of time, but all of them were very memorable and very funny. I think the funniest part of the film was when Gibson was trying to ring the police and he kept being given lots of options before he could be connected to the police.

The idea of cloning animals just isn't that interesting and the fact that it seemed important at the start and then was ignored for the rest of the film also seemed a little bit strange.

I say mostly because I was led to believe this movie had battles similar to Dragonball Z (superpowered characters facing off against one another), but that certainly is not the case here. I guess I was expecting a bit more 1v1 battles between espers (those with psychic abilities), but instead, the movie had a deeper story to tell. Akira is a brash and dark film that takes place in a dystopian future where the government is struggling to keep secret the evolution of mankind. The concept alone was enough to hook me in and using animation was the perfect medium for this type of story to fully flourish.Everything in the movie was unique to say the least, from an animation standpoint to its bizarre conclusion. If you go into this movie thinking it will be nothing more than action or your typical 'strange' anime, you will be quite surprised at how much detail goes into the story itself. There are a ton of ideas floating around (albeit a bit too many to fully understand most of the time) but the important ones are developed quite nicely. But those larger ideas that they choose to focus on really do thrive thanks to the animation, which as I said, know no bounds except the imagination of its creator. The only downside seemed to be most of what occurs in the first half of the movie seems a tad irrelevant in the end. It was as if the creators were trying to throw in too many ideas from the manga into the movie and it became a bit convoluted. But that is where the whole idea of rewatching the movie comes into play, Akira makes a bit more sense having seen where the story goes in the end. That way, as the movie progresses you can follow what exactly characters mean when talking about past events that occurred which we are given very little detail about.But the main driving force behind Akira (for me) had to be the idea of unleashing the supremely powerful Akira. Knowing that he was powerful enough to release the energy equivalent of a hydrogen bomb was enough to suck me in for the entire runtime. It was this idea that made the movie interesting if not nerve-wracking because we don't exactly know what kind of a person Akira is, is he good or bad? Will he save the world or choose to destroy? It was this type of trepidation building throughout the entire movie which lead to the final climax of the film that worked for the most part. I have to admit, I wasn't expecting the type of ending the movie had, at first I was disappointed with how everything ended up, but as time went by, I kept thinking more and more about the ending. And eventually came to the conclusion that the ending was justified. It not only leaves the viewer in awe but more importantly, it leaves a very strong lasting impression.Looking back on the film, the actual storyline of the movie is a bit more interesting to me than what was put on film (possibly meaning the manga would be something I should look into). While I didn't necessarily love the movie like I thought I would, mostly because it seemed to have pacing issues (at least the first hour of the film), the story itself was right up my alley. That being said, I would gladly watch the second half of the movie because that's where the action picks up, the telekinesis starts to appear, the characters start coming together, and the movie dives deep into hardcore science-fiction.

With big panning shots of the local life and grand orchestra tunes it sometimes feels more like a National Geographic documentary than a movie.Out of Africa however is not about lions, but about relationships. Similar to stories like Pride and Prejudice it does not rely upon much of a story. There is some business with the farm in Africa, some diseases and some hunting trips, but beyond that there is not a whole lot happening. However, despite the lengthy runtime, the movie does not get boring as the actors do a good job and it is interesting to see their characters get revealed and interacted with, and the two main characters played by Robert Redford and Meryl Streep show good chemistry together. That said, It is understandable if not everyone will agree that this is enough to justify sitting through over 2 hours of it.A praiseworthy quality is the film's subtlety and intelligence, specifically in its dialogue. Often not a whole lot is being said and pauses can be long but the meaning is plentiful and relatively clear.Out of Africa has an interesting positive mood. It left me feeling uplifted. However, if I look back at the story and all its negative turns, it is one of the darker stories I have encountered. How does this movie manage to do that? Not sure, but it seems that freedom, peace, love, determination and acceptance prevail over the hardships.A point of annoyance for me came from an unusual angle. As you watch this movie you realise that this is a story about a white noblewoman from Denmark having love adventures in Africa, against the background of half-naked poor black servants, but the movie redeems itself to some degree by acknowledging the problem of colonialism in its story and dialogue and by making the main character fairly likable and hardworking.Another point of annoyance is Meryl's prominent friend played by Klaus Brandauer. He has 0 chemistry with her and does a whole range of despicable things and the movie, with its music and dialogue, does not seem to recognize it. Meryl's character keeps giving him a pass. Perhaps that is realistic for the position of women in the time in which this story takes place. Again, the movie is subtle so perhaps it is expected that a character like this is not vilified.Yet another small nitpick is the accent. I am sure Meryl Streep is doing an excellent Danish accent. Unfortunately, I had trouble understanding the first part of the movie because of it.Out of Africa is a personal positive experience centered on character interaction. Unless you are not into that, there is no reason not to watch a quality movie like that. ","genre":null},{"date":"27 July 2015","score":"","review":" Out of Africa is a film that invokes wanderlust.

As you watch this movie you realise that this is a story about a white noblewoman from Denmark having love adventures in Africa, against the background of half-naked poor black servants, but the movie redeems itself to some degree by acknowledging the problem of colonialism in its story and dialogue and by making the main character fairly likable and hardworking.Another point of annoyance is Meryl's prominent friend played by Klaus Brandauer. He has 0 chemistry with her and does a whole range of despicable things and the movie, with its music and dialogue, does not seem to recognize it. Meryl's character keeps giving him a pass. Perhaps that is realistic for the position of women in the time in which this story takes place. Again, the movie is subtle so perhaps it is expected that a character like this is not vilified.Yet another small nitpick is the accent. I am sure Meryl Streep is doing an excellent Danish accent. Unfortunately, I had trouble understanding the first part of the movie because of it.Out of Africa is a personal positive experience centered on character interaction. Unless you are not into that, there is no reason not to watch a quality movie like that. ","genre":"Biography, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"27 July 2015","score":"","review":" Out of Africa is a film that invokes wanderlust. With that name it has to, doesn't it. With big panning shots of the local life and grand orchestra tunes it sometimes feels more like a National Geographic documentary than a movie.Out of Africa however is not about lions, but about relationships. Similar to stories like Pride and Prejudice it does not rely upon much of a story. There is some business with the farm in Africa, some diseases and some hunting trips, but beyond that there is not a whole lot happening. However, despite the lengthy runtime, the movie does not get boring as the actors do a good job and it is interesting to see their characters get revealed and interacted with, and the two main characters played by Robert Redford and Meryl Streep show good chemistry together. That said, It is understandable if not everyone will agree that this is enough to justify sitting through over 2 hours of it.A praiseworthy quality is the film's subtlety and intelligence, specifically in its dialogue. Often not a whole lot is being said and pauses can be long but the meaning is plentiful and relatively clear.Out of Africa has an interesting positive mood. It left me feeling uplifted.

Even for now, the story still stands as one of the greatest, especially for me. What's lacking about the movie is that even though it runs at about two ours, it doesn't really elaborate much on Truman's unsuspecting life. The movie immediately sets its conflicts and Truman's suspicions as soon as Truman's character is introduced. Nevertheless the movie can really hold on to its grip over the story and exploits all it can from the angles by using the lens filters and robotics-moved cameras to give the actual spy- cam feel. The acting overall feels also nice. Jim Carrey's acting feels suiting to Truman's character and the changes he goes through.Laura Linney did her part well enough, maintaining that smirk almost all over her screen time. Noah Emmerich did also well by providing the balance needed for Truman's dialogs. Natascha McElhone and Ed Harris did nice in completing the needed angles this movie requires.
