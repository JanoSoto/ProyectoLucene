Without the provocation of a cold war to stimulate public interest or the attraction of exploitable resources to curry Congressional favor, NASA has barely survived on periodic spikes of fascination via unmanned Mars landings, comet fly-bys and far-sighted peeks into the heart of the universe by that miraculous workhorse, the Hubble Telescope. With much of the cosmos so easily scrutinized from the comfort of a climate-controlled laboratory, the prospects for manned exploration have taken a backseat to the simple push of a button (not to mention evermore realistic-looking science-fiction films and television programs). Now, more than ever, NASA is eager to engage in all positive exercises in healthy self-promotion. Mission To Mars is, alas, not one of them.In what is more or less a remake of 1955's clunky Conquest Of Space, we are forced to bear witness to TWO crews of astonishingly uninteresting astronauts during their respective missions to decipher the mystery of the infamous face on Mars. As another user noted, a more apt title would have been Rescue Mission To Mars, since nothing is shown of mankind's ostensibly historic first landing there. Instead, we are privy to a completely superfluous introduction to both teams of astronauts at a backyard barbecue (lifted right out of Apollo 13). Cut To now we're on Mars. Who, wha, huh...? After an ill-fated though impressive-looking sojourn by Team One to examine the face close-up, the first-string actors back on Earth are then dispatched to Mars to attempt a rescue and then spend nearly half the movie's would-be modest 113 minute running time just tooling around the spaceship or trying to figure out how to land.The real mystery here, aside from NASA's extensive participation, is how a major studio like Disney, an accomplished director like Brian DePalma and a cadre of fine A-list actors would have anything to do with such an under-developed, plagiaristic, illogical and cliché-ridden TV-quality script as this. I kept waiting for Sparks the radioman and Cookie the cook to show up! Despite NASA's input (and some of the science IS accurate), scientific impossibilities abound. To name but a few there should be no sound in space; there should be virtually no sound on Mars; the floating M&Ms would not stay still in one place, let alone remain proximate to the others, no matter how hard one tried; characters should not be able to easily hear each other if one or the other is wearing a helmet; the leaking fuel wouldn't have drifted rear-ward because it's going the same speed as the spacecraft; if the ship is spinning out of control after the explosion, how is it the astronauts aren't all spinning wildly into space as they abandon ship; I'm still working on how on Mars Graham is able to maintain a livable temperature, adequate pressure and a breathable atmosphere inside what is simply a large tent; many, many more inconsistencies.In fairness, some clarification should be made for the many extreme comments made by others here, no doubt borne out of their intense disappointment after months of anticipation. Mission To Mars is not too slow or too long--it is simply uninteresting. Many have criticized the actors to varying degrees for below-par performances--on the contrary, they do as fine a job as possible with some of the worst dialogue they've likely ever encountered. (We are beset with lines such as--delivered with 100% sincerity--It's like looking for a needle in a haystack; I actually emitted an audible Oooooo after that one.) The score by Ennio Morricone is not bad--it's simply...all wrong for THIS movie. In fact, Mission to Mars would have fared better with little or no music. Many have complained that the (definitely underwhelming) alien is anything but convincing--I suspect that it might be due to the fact that it is not actually a living being but, like the elaborate presentation of ancient Martian history to the astronauts, it is simply a projection and not meant to realistically mimic 100% the actual appearance of a Martian (hence it's eventual evaporation). After all, how could an alien or its progeny have survived for millions of years inside the face? Additionally, the much-maligned tear that it sheds may simply represent a non-verbal but recognizable iconographic signal to the astronauts that the devastation of the Martian surface long ago caused great emotional turmoil as no doubt many millions of Martians perished (yes, I'm throwing the filmmakers a bone, but what the hey, it's possible.)In any event, no audience can be truly faulted for its disdain of Mission To Mars. Though watchable to some extent (and it IS a very handsome production), it is a MAJOR disappointment, plain and simple. As mentioned by so many, there is little here that hasn't been seen a hundred times before. I imagine this film will play much better to younger audiences who haven't been exposed to its many routine excesses (excess routines?) If released twenty years ago, no doubt throngs of people would sing its praises. But with countless examples of much finer science-fiction films released in the interim, the filmmakers should have known better than to dole this pablum out to an audience eminently more sophisticated than they realize. With any luck, the clamor of outrage sparked by this movie's release will reach the ears of studio execs everywhere and (shedding a tear here) we won't fall victim to such underestimation in the future.

Sounds like a wild ride or is it? The story centers around a group of teens who survive an airliner explosion through a bizarre incident. After the crash, one teen (Devon Sawa) becomes completely convinced that the Grim Reaper is after him and he is hunting the group in the way they should have died in the explosion. Producer, co-screenwriter, and director James Wong re-teams with his partner Glen Morgan for a stab at the silver screen. Morgan and Wong's greatest exploit has to have been the couple seasons of the X-Files where it became the staple for TV suspense and to this day the series is still trying to recapture. They have continue to dabble in TV with such series as the little seen but at times brilliant Space Above and Beyond and NBC's recent hit The Others. But with the debut of Final Destination it's the team's first real venture onto the silver screen. Destination starts off with a great opening 20 minutes where we are shocked and dumbfounded by the opening plot. I haven't seen that thrilling of a plane disaster scene since 1993's Alive. Wow, what a scene. And as the film moves along a lot of the scenes are shocking and keep you on your toes. But it's the latter half of the film that bugged me. The time I am talking about is just when ex-Hollywood sex symbol Ali Larter's hair starts to get blonder. Ever notice that in Hollywood films they always dumb down the leading lady until she is supposed to catch the hero's eye? It's at that point that Sawa's avoidance of the Grim Reaper get really hokey. That cabin scene is a perfect example. Every movie like this needs a supernatural ending and the finale here is gimmickry and unrealistic. If you love the humor-horror trilogy of Scream like so many million people then Destination has all that to offer but watch out for a couple goofy things along the way.  I guess other Scream clone I Know What You Did this Summer and especially its sequel got this back lash too. The young people out there will love this, I am sure. (3 of 5) So Says the Soothsayer.

Johnny Depp plays his Ichabod with comic zest, Christina Ricci proves once again to be a quite talented young lady, and the rest of the cast is also excellent, including a stunning Christopher Walken as the Hessian Horseman (in an uncredited appearance, I believe), and  Christopher Lee and Martin Landau also shine in small parts.

David E. Kelly is far too overextended.  Attempting to write movies like this are causing his solid series like Ally McBeal and The Practice to suffer.  I will say there was some witty dialogue in Lake Placid, but mostly I was laughing at the ludicrous plot and Bridget Fonda's unprecedentedly terrible performance.  The thirty foot crocodile failed to frighten me in the slightest, and this is someone who didn't sleep for a week after seeing Scream, which wasn't very scary either, talking.  The plot was just so thin it was laughable.  How did the crocodiles get there?  How did they survive the winter?

This movie celebrates murder and perjury as being great, the right thing to do, the example we must cheer. It is so they were criminals, then it is okay if we are even worse criminals. And to the intrinsic immorality of the story, there is the added immorality of attempting to pass off this story as true.I feel sorry for those who swallowed this absurd plot hook and sinker, but what about those who admit that the story is a fake, but then, so what? What, do you just love to be lied at? To be fooled by those who invent facts because truth is not sexy enough? It is obvious what they did here as fiction this is a pretty pedestrian thriller, but disguised as reality it becomes much more compelling. Now, even if I bought the story, the vengeance plot would still be unacceptable. In fact, I would say these people, the alleged abuse victims, are obviously thugs, liars and murderers. Why on earth should I believe their abuse tales are true?But then, of course, nothing of this can be true. It is true that more preposterous things have actually happened in real life, but in this case some corroboration of the story should exist. To begin with, because of the way case law functions there are records of every trial that ever took place at a court of law. Even if the names were all changed there should still be records of the trial, and there aren't. I suppose that the movie is all wrong because the book is not right, but nobody forced them to make a movie out of such preposterous book. Everything about this movie ranges from indifferent to downright bad, with the exception of the kids, who are quite good and deserved otherwise. The adult cast, on the other hand, is a disaster zone. What were De Niro and Hoffman thinking?! De Niro looks plainly embarrassed and Hoffman looks drunk... OK, so he played a drunk, but he looks as if he wasn't acting, see? Brad Pitt is as bad actor as usual, but Jason Patric manages to be even worse, and that is no mean feat.
