It is slightly better than I might have expected and that's probably due to the talent involved.The movie stars Marisa Tomei, probably the only actress who could have made this material believable. She has the effect of being cute without being cutesy. She plays the appropriately named Faith who, since childhood, has believed that her entire destiny is leading her to be with a man named Damon Bradley. She is told by a fortune teller at the age of 11 that she and Bradley are destined to be together. She has no idea who this man is, but stands hard and fast to the information that their bond is written in the stars.Years later, now in her 20s, she has given up on Damon Bradley and is about to marry a podiatrist. On her wedding day, she receives a phone call from a friend of her husband-to-be saying that he cannot attend. His name . . . Damon Bradley, and he's on his way to Rome. Without a second thought, Faith and her sister-in-law Kate (played by the invaluable Bonnie Hunt) jump on a plane and go after him.Faith and Kate run around Venice like maniacs trying to track down Damon Bradley and when they find him, he turns out to be exactly what Faith had hoped he would be. He is handsome, dark-haired, charming and looks exactly like Robert Downey Jr. Who wouldn't swoon? The two embark on a sweet tour of Rome, very much in the same vein that Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck did in Roman Holiday. In fact, one of their stops is Pavonazzetto marble monument of The Mouth of Truth which was most famously seen in that 1953 classic.Yet, it wouldn't be romantic comedy if they simply fell in love. A complication arises with the validity of whether or not Downey actually is Damon Bradley. That sets the whole movie off on a wacky romp through the countryside as he tries to prove to her that he really is in love with her, despite the validity of his claim.This is all not to be believed. Only You is the kind of happy romantic comedy of a bygone era, before cynicism became an insurance policy. This is a movie that believes in destiny and fate and love at first sight and it is played through a cast of actors who are smart enough and convincing enough to pull it off. What distinguishes this movie above most is that it is always just a notch better than it should be.Marisa Tomei and Robert Downey Jr. are beautiful people but they are such good actors that they are able to sell this story with a convincing charm. Tomei, with her wide-eyes, and pouty lips is able to push through this confection and make you believe that she really does believe everything that she is saying. Downey too is excellent, giving us a character who wears his heart on his sleeve. He loves this woman and he is willing to do what it takes to be with her. They're good together, even when the script tips in the direction of being too unbelievable for its own good.Both Downey and Tomei are wonderful, but for my money, the real gem of this movie is the supporting performance of Bonnie Hunt, as Faith's eternally-loyal sister-in-law. She always stands just to the side of Tomei and brings the movie an unexpected, and very funny, extra joy. Her comic timing is flawless. She has a manner of giving us funny asides that are delivered with just the right precision like I married a liar. Why? Because I married a man. I love that line and her comment when she and Faith are dismayed by an awful wedding dress that had been handed down, she says If I had a dress like that, I'd give it away too.Kate has her own problems back home with an uncaring husband (Fisher Stevens) how has long ago abandoned love for a union that doesn't stretch beyond Where's dinner? She's a portrait of what happens to a marriage long after the ceremony when two people have settled into a relentless pattern of misunderstanding. Yet, what comes of their relationship completely took me by surprise.Only You was directed by Norman Jewison, the man who directed Fiddler on the Roof, In the Heat of the Night and the one of the best romantic comedies of all time Moonstruck. He doesn't succeed as well this time. This movie often feels like a nice day off, something he made as a lark. The movie is like cotton candy, all about romance and love and destiny shot against the background of one of the most beautiful locations on earth. There's nothing really wrong with that, it is probably better than it should be, given the creative talents but it won't leave you with much to think about.

Her good girl image is also a turn off for her sexy adulterous boss, Sam (Kevin Bacon). So when a friend sees a photo of her taken at a friend's wedding with a friend of the groom's, she concludes that the two are a couple. Kate then invents a fictitious engagement to the man, Nick, (Jay Mohr)who she had never met before the wedding. It impresses her colleagues and bags her Sam. Kate pays Nick to pose as her fictitious man but her plan gets screwed up a little when he falls in love with her.I know that the advertising industry might be concerned with the 'image' of employees but I doubt that they would imply that being single and living with your mother meant that you had no career path. I'm pretty sure that you could sue for the implication that your love life and where you live prevents you from promotion. Anyway, the opposite tends to be true- the married couples are likely to leave and have children. Also, Kate must earn enough to get her own flat and surely if she's worked up to a good position in the company, she's got a bit of independence and drive? She seems to have quite a few psychological issues.Jennifer Aniston acquits herself well in a movie that probably is just a vehicle for her.

If you're willing to buy in, and ignore the fact that so much of the movie makes no sense at all, Independence Day can be a rollicking good time. Will Smith is perfect for this sort of thing, Jeff Goldblum falls perfectly into his world-saving scientist role, Randy Quaid makes for an entertaining kook and Judd Hirsch provides some laughs. Some of the other performers admittedly don't fare as well. Harvey Fierstein is an over-the-top annoyance, Brent Spiner makes his bizarre scientist much, much too bizarre to take at all seriously and the key female characters, played by Margaret Colin and Vivica A.

It marks the return of the notorious seclusive writer\/director Terrance Malick, who had not completed a film in twenty years prior to this one's release.This is not your typical war drama. It is so much more. It has everything your normal combat movie would cover, excellently shot battle sequences and explores the turmoils of war. You see first hand how the characters slowly begin to lose their grip on reality, as innocence if the first causality of war.Malick handles the story by starting out with two American soldiers who go AWOL, somewhere on a small island filled with natives in the Pacific Ocean. This segment, to me at least, in the greatest sign that life really is beautiful. After the AWOL soldiers are back in the navy's possession, that's when we are introduced to Guadalcanal, a small island with a Japanese airfield.What follows are incredibly scenes of action, some surpassing the likes of 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'Platoon.' The soldiers question, in great detail, why they are fighting this war (Not politically but philosophically.) The movie is long, sure, but needs to cover a great amount of information.The cast is phenomenal. Nearly every actor with a speaking role, (and a few without,) have become big name actors. The best performances comes from the veteran actor Nick Nolte, who plays an aging Colonel. Who he didn't earn himself a Best Supporting Actor nod, or a win, I do not know.

However after reading maybe 30 or more reviews here I have noticed two things which need a comment (skip to bottom). But I also just watched the video interviews (by the Guardian newspaper) in which Malcolm McDowell, Jan Harlan and Christiane Kubrick discuss the remastered 40th anniversary edition of Stanley Kubrick's dystopian masterpiece, screening at the Cannes film festival (May, 2011).I saw the movie when it was first released and still remember the feeling of shock. It does traumatize you. But, as most reviews here agree, in no way does it glorify this kind of urban violence. Every gen-Y, Z should be forced to watch this when they hit 15, as a prophylactic against such senseless violence. I have had the DVD since it first came out, but must admit I haven't watched it for ages and am not sure I want to. Yet, I give it 9 stars! How can such a great movie be one you don't want to watch? But it is true, as so many reviews here testify.Anyway the things I did not find in other reviews Kubrick is a master but Anthony Burgess deserves almost equal credit. I had read his 1962 book of the same name before I saw the movie. (Same year as movie of To Kill a Mocking Bird, one year after Catch 22 publication and one year before Pynchon's first book, V; whew!) Like the movie, it probably should not have worked. it uses an invented argot called Nadsat (a mix of Russian and English) which makes it tough going--and would normally make me stop reading. But it is brilliant and is simply one of those inexplicable works of art. (Read it; the other astounding thing, given its impact, is that it is just a novella that can be read in almost one sitting.) One understands why Kubrick wanted to make it into a film as soon as he read it. It was hard to imagine it being filmable but equally impossible to imagine anyone else filming it. Second thing is that several reviews here falsely state that the film was banned in the UK. No, it was Kubrick who took it out of circulation after about 12 months because it was hugely controversial. He and his family were besieged by nutters at their house near London, and by endless telephone crank calls. Burgess also thought the film so brilliant that it might be dangerous. It is true the police and government were pretty unhappy with the much speculated copy-catting by youth. It is arguable whether that was true but Burgess was amazingly ahead of his time though no doubt partly inspired by the Mod gang wars happening in the late 50s early 60s when he was writing it. Parts of the film look like they could be something out of 80s or 90s modern culture (eg. Tarantino).So, an astounding film based on an astounding book.

The movie tells the story of Andy Dufresne, portrayed brilliantly by Tim Robbins, who is sent to Shawshank prison, when framed as the murderer of his wife, and her affair lover. During his time in prison, Andy makes an unlikely friendship with smoke dealer Red, portrayed by the astounding Morgan Freeman, who does an excellent job of guiding the movie with his smoothing, and confident narration. Now, the rest of the movie talks about Andy's struggle to try and break free from Shawshank, and the unexpected friendship between two different people. This movie is an astounding masterpiece, that can only be spoken through the words of the mysteriously defying Stephen King. Director Frank Darabont helped bring King's vision to life on the screen, and he performed an excellent job as a director, and a writer. Also, the cast is such a true miracle, that the movie was able to get the finest actors to play the most finest cinematic roles. Tim Robbins is excellent, Morgan Freeman is astounding, Bob Gunton is brilliant, and James Whitmore plays such a dramatic small role as Brooks, the Shawshank librarian. Also, I enjoyed Thomas Newman's breathtaking score, the perfect cinematography, the excellent use of film editing, and the spectacular script.

It also takes dead aim at the advance of a mechanized age, a modernizing society dependent on speed and efficiency at the expense of humanity. Fritz Lang's austere 1927 film Metropolis took a similar approach but with a much darker tone, daring to ask 'Who are the slaves of the machines? For Chaplin, opposition to that slavery is on display in his comedic, almost manic depiction of factory life and the assembly line. One can't help but notice the influence Chaplin had on later film makers; I immediately drew a comparison to Lucille Ball's hilarious attempt to keep pace at the candy factory, blending elements of Chaplin's frantic pace on the assembly line with the dehumanizing aspect of the Bellows Feeding Machine.A startling aspect of the story line for me was the introduction of the communist element when The Tramp is arrested for accidentally leading a workers' revolt. One doesn't immediately connect the term 'communist' to it's Bolshevik roots dating back to 1917, but it was obviously on Chaplin's mind two decades later.Knowing that he did his own stunts, it was truly amazing to see Chaplin's dexterity on a pair of roller skates. The blindfold scene on the fourth floor toy shop was incredible, and made me wonder what precautions were taken to prevent serious injury in case all didn't go well. Obviously, the man had talents that went well beyond making films.I mentioned that scene from an 'I Love Lucy' episode earlier, but there's another observation I'd like to offer that might have influenced the opening to a popular TV show of the Sixties. In his domestic daydream involving The Gamin (Paulette Goddard), The Tramp is shown walking away from the camera and tripping over an ottoman as he approaches Goddard. One could surmise that Dick Van Dyke took inspiration for his own pratfall gimmick from the master Chaplin some quarter century later.
