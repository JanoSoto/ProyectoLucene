It's also an astounding view through the portals of time back to the embryonic mindset of the Nazi culture.Let's start with the visuals. To me, it wasn't what Lang and Von Harbou had in their minds to present, it was the fact that they were able to so completely realize the society and culture of Metropolis on film down to the smallest detail. There isn't just the hint of the way things are - it's there right in front of you, bloody warts and all. The cityscape recedes far in the distance, the cars stop and people actually get out of them in what seems to be over a mile away.

You have no idea of what he is doing when he generates the robot Maria, but it and his performance look so convincing that you believe it anyway.The theatrical acting so often found in silent movies is now tuned to a minimum due to the re-editing of scenes, the changing and re-ordering of the inter title cards, and the inclusion of 25 minutes of additional scenes unseen since the original film's premiere. All of this was previously impossible. The original film script had long disappeared, the film was incoherently re-edited for the US market, and there were no longer any clues as how to put it back together.With the discovery of clues within the original film score composer's archives and the German Film Censor's Board notes, the correct order of shots was finally reestablished, and now the film makes sense for the first time.The following portions may contain spoilers (really, you need to be warned about a film from 1927??) I find the structure of the society of Metropolis to be baffling. Automation was understood when this film was made, in fact there's automation present within the movie. I can follow the idea of someone subjugating a class of people, but I can't follow the idea of that person making their lives so obviously into a time-bomb dangerous to oneself. The workers are (grudgingly) allowing themselves to be tied to working with and within enormous machines, whose every function is tied to their performing the same task, over and over again. Should the person fail to perform their task for whatever reason, the entire complex is in danger.It's understood that is to be the case by every worker as there is a safe\/danger indicator at every work station. These tasks should logically be automated. Why do they need people to perform them when the society is advanced and seems perfectly capable of automation? Why have they made the mechanics of the underground city so subject to human failure? And, why is the above-ground city so unprotected? For answers to this, I turn to the Nazi culture. In fact the movie and the Nazis are very much tied together. Here's a parallel equation to this movie for starters Why in the concentration camps did they use a dozen inmates to hand-pull a heavy cart containing a package the size of a pack of cigarettes? It's the same answer as in this movie. It's the same answer you find in the novel 1984 it's control for the gain of power's sake only. There's no form of compassion, it's all done for the Party and for the Party only.There IS no hope under this situation, only death.Even the film's ending is hogwash, complete and and total nonsense.

The workers at the end of this movie aren't free, in fact as they march toward him at the film's end they are in a triangular arrow formation with heads bowed. They are even more submissive and restricted in that formation than in the rectangles they march in during the movie. They have nothing, their city is destroyed. They have no one to turn to except for Joh Frederson. The workers have no thought, and not even the slightest bit of capacity for self-governing. They are made by Joh Frederson's society to be helpless without him.Joh Frederson sure seems contrite at the film's ending, but inside I bet he's grinning.

DS is that weird. So much so, if you watch its first 5 min. you may take it for an X--rated flick for airplanes. First you get a bed of clouds. Then, a metallic phallus. Then those two going at each other up in the sky. That weird.I saw DS for a first time in my early teens and the images that stuck in my imagination were those of the planes up in the sky and Pickings riding the bomb to oblivion; then, Dr. Strangelove struggling with his hand & Hayden chomping on a cigar. By that time mankind was feeling the hangovers from the Cuban Missile crisis and the Kennedy assassination, so we sorely needed a laugh, even if a nervous one, and Kubrick was the man to provide it. Now, after many years I watched it again and I can say it's still a great film, but I noticed that something is dragging it down, preventing it from being a fully accomplished classic. So I went to examine it, setting by setting, to detect the source of the malfunction and this is the result As a cinematographic experience, the best parts are those of the flying B-52, the cockpit scenes. They alone make for an superb thriller, even more so when combined with shots of the plane racing across the sky. The tension inherent to the situation is always there, never letting up; K. making sure you won't lose any of the action, the view of the proceedings down to every button being pushed, every dial being turned. These are the sequences that give the film such a dynamic, adrenaline charged pace. And a fresh look too; was not for the B\/W you'd think it was shot yesterday. What makes the B-52's atmosphere even more intense is the tightly enclosed space, the claustrophobic setting, which works on an even unintended level, preventing K. from resorting to the long shots he loved so. The last image (the bomb-riding cowboy) propels the film right into 10\/10 territory.Then we have a completely different setting & mood, even if deriving too from the same situation. The Pentagon's war room where Prez Muffley consults with collaborators. Here the fast paced action shifts to what is possible for a group of men sitting at a table; mood & content change to suit those of a comedy noir. Not surprisingly, what takes preeminence now are characters, dialog, acting, which makes for this setting the greatest provider of ironic or absurd lines. Here Sellers takes on two roles and while there's no doubt about his DS and Scott's Turgidson competing for tops here, it's his M. Muffley the embodiment of the viewer's common sense in such an upside down world. That's no coincidence, as K. told him to play it straight. In any case this setting keeps up pretty well with the first one, even if at a more formal, settled down pace. Then we have the air base.In this setting, see how things change with the arrival of Bat Guano. See how Mandrake's behavior changes; he becomes a man again. That bit is one of the funniest of the film because of its confrontational nature. Now it's clear what Kubrick's mistake was he didn't give Ripper anything to collide with, as Mandrake had already surrendered to him, to the point of becoming his effeminate partner. That's why their scenes drag down the pace, as the tension collected in the other two settings dilutes in a mood of understanding and dialog--or rather of submission & dominance. Someone says that Mandrake should have wrestled the code from him and while that's not a good idea, it points in the right direction. Truth is, Hayden could only play it straight, so it was unrealistic to ask from him what Scott did so well when turning Turgidson into a cartoon. In Asphalt Jungle they went around it--in the bit where he's fatally wounded and goes to die amongst horses, which he loved--simply making him stumble over there, that seen in a long shot. This was touching, without him having to do any acting. That's more or less gives an idea about what K. failed to do to introduce some element of tension in Ripper's office and make him react to it--before the battle that is. That should cost DS 1 point, but I'll give it back for its great contribution to cinema culture.BTW, terrific combat sequence, far better than those in FMJ.

DS is that weird. So much so, if you watch its first 5 min. you may take it for an X--rated flick for airplanes. First you get a bed of clouds. Then, a metallic phallus. Then those two going at each other up in the sky. That weird.I saw DS for a first time in my early teens and the images that stuck in my imagination were those of the planes up in the sky and Pickings riding the bomb to oblivion; then, Dr. Strangelove struggling with his hand & Hayden chomping on a cigar. By that time mankind was feeling the hangovers from the Cuban Missile crisis and the Kennedy assassination, so we sorely needed a laugh, even if a nervous one, and Kubrick was the man to provide it. Now, after many years I watched it again and I can say it's still a great film, but I noticed that something is dragging it down, preventing it from being a fully accomplished classic. So I went to examine it, setting by setting, to detect the source of the malfunction and this is the result As a cinematographic experience, the best parts are those of the flying B-52, the cockpit scenes. They alone make for an superb thriller, even more so when combined with shots of the plane racing across the sky. The tension inherent to the situation is always there, never letting up; K. making sure you won't lose any of the action, the view of the proceedings down to every button being pushed, every dial being turned. These are the sequences that give the film such a dynamic, adrenaline charged pace. And a fresh look too; was not for the B\/W you'd think it was shot yesterday. What makes the B-52's atmosphere even more intense is the tightly enclosed space, the claustrophobic setting, which works on an even unintended level, preventing K. from resorting to the long shots he loved so. The last image (the bomb-riding cowboy) propels the film right into 10\/10 territory.Then we have a completely different setting & mood, even if deriving too from the same situation. The Pentagon's war room where Prez Muffley consults with collaborators. Here the fast paced action shifts to what is possible for a group of men sitting at a table; mood & content change to suit those of a comedy noir. Not surprisingly, what takes preeminence now are characters, dialog, acting, which makes for this setting the greatest provider of ironic or absurd lines. Here Sellers takes on two roles and while there's no doubt about his DS and Scott's Turgidson competing for tops here, it's his M. Muffley the embodiment of the viewer's common sense in such an upside down world. That's no coincidence, as K. told him to play it straight. In any case this setting keeps up pretty well with the first one, even if at a more formal, settled down pace. Then we have the air base.In this setting, see how things change with the arrival of Bat Guano. See how Mandrake's behavior changes; he becomes a man again. That bit is one of the funniest of the film because of its confrontational nature. Now it's clear what Kubrick's mistake was he didn't give Ripper anything to collide with, as Mandrake had already surrendered to him, to the point of becoming his effeminate partner. That's why their scenes drag down the pace, as the tension collected in the other two settings dilutes in a mood of understanding and dialog--or rather of submission & dominance. Someone says that Mandrake should have wrestled the code from him and while that's not a good idea, it points in the right direction. Truth is, Hayden could only play it straight, so it was unrealistic to ask from him what Scott did so well when turning Turgidson into a cartoon. In Asphalt Jungle they went around it--in the bit where he's fatally wounded and goes to die amongst horses, which he loved--simply making him stumble over there, that seen in a long shot. This was touching, without him having to do any acting.

Bad call, Rachel.Before the film even gets underway, the opening credits spell disaster right off the bat, offering us a quote from Friedrich Nietzsche followed by an old Freddy one-liner chestnut. Perhaps even worse, we are treated with a song that sounds like an uptempo Goo Goo Dolls number and readily earns the prize for the crappiest music ever to grace the franchise, no small feat considering that by this point Nightmare films had been accompanied by Dokken's Dream Warriors and the infamous Freddy Rap. The high-concept and increasingly elaborate dream kills the franchise is famous for reach an absurd apex here. When our first victim is a deaf teen who is dispatched after Freddy affixes a demonic hearing aid to the lad's ear and scratches his claws on a chalkboard until his prey's head explodes, it's pretty much cemented that the only reason we're going to finish watching this film is out of some sort of misguided completist loyalty to the series.So much of Freddy's Dead completely ignores or misconstrues the mythos laid out in the movies before it that the only thing that ultimately ties this sixth installment to the rest of the series is Freddy himself. The deviation most insulting to fans is Freddy's revelation that the murders in the earlier films were committed because his daughter was taken from him when his pre-dream demon crimes were discovered (so I took all their children away). After 5 films supporting the excellent back-story that Freddy's impetus is systematically killing the children of the vigilante parents who burned him alive, this alteration to the origin is both needless and confusing. By the time we discover during the denouement that Freddy was granted his horrifying powers by a trio of floating latex puppets who look like prehistoric fish, it has already been made abundantly clear that the film-makers either didn't like or haven't seen the original Nightmare On Elm Street.In installments 3 and 4, so much was made of the Kristen character's ability to pull her friends into her dreams (it was her unique dream power, remember?), but in Freddy's Dead, characters are inexplicably able to insert themselves into other characters' nocturnal visions at will. Even more confusing is how often the film forgets whether or not characters are asleep. Awake characters witness the dream actions of sleeping characters without explanation, such as in the extended video game skit, where three lucid characters watch the impending victim bounce around the house in a ridiculously bad slapstick physical comedy routine complete with boing boing sound effects.

Princess Mononoke centers around the young and noble hearted Ashitaka, whom after being cursed by a demon, must journey to the sacred forest to be exorcised before the curse ultimately destroys him. On his journey, he encounters several forest spirits, a group of iron workers, and a mysterious girl raised by the forest's wolves. The story focuses on the constant clash of man and nature, and how both must make sacrifices in order to coexist. There are no heroes, and no villains. All shareholders have motivations that can be sympathized with, and some that cannot. The story is deep, compelling and flows very well. I will admit at times it can become moderately confusing, especially when elements of mysticism are introduced. However it's presented so well, I feel that the confusion is my fault, not the film's;. It's as if my insufficient mind isn't capable of grasping the magnitude of the plot. The characters human, animal and otherwise are all well developed, multi-layered and interesting. The animation is the Miyazaki standard very bright, very vibrant and always carrying energy and emotion. The action scenes are some of the best in all of animation and the entire film carries with it a sense of awe and wonder. The film even manages to take several actions that we would otherwise consider disgusting, and make them appear beautiful. The music corresponds to the scenes perfectly and moves the story almost as much the animation and dialogue. I recommend you watch the film in Japanese as the English dub is very good in places, but downright annoying in others.

In South Africa, Gandhi (played terrifically by Ben Kingsley) fights against discrimination laws against Indians, but instructs his followers to fight non-violently. This will set a precedent for his return to India, where he travels the country, observes the state of the people, and takes on the discriminatory British laws one by one. Time and time again, the British authorities try to bring him down, but Gandhi continually growing support from his people make it harder to suppress his demands. However, when India's independence is increasingly becoming a reality, so is the fact that India could partition into two nations because of religious differences, something Gandhi fiercely opposes and has trouble trying to control.Of all the compliments and accolades that have gone to this movie, the most seem to be directed at Ben Kingsley, and for good reason. He is incredibly convincing as Gandhi, showing the great gravitas the man could hold when he was leading demonstrations of thousands. He also shows how committed Gandhi was to his views. Take, for example, the moment when a his friend Walker (Martin Sheen) comments to him, You're an ambitious man, and Gandhi replies, I hope not. His response, though not forceful, still hits an odd nerve, as you wonder how someone who wants equality for his people in such a segregated state could not consider himself ambitious. And yet, that response makes the rest of his actions in the movie make that much more sense. Though he is deeply committed to equality (and later, independence), he also believes it's an inherent right, not something you're born without. It's kind of surprising that Kingsley's track record after this film has been rather erratic, although he did have good turns in Schindler's List and Shutter Island.Director Richard Attenborough wastes as few details as possible about Gandhi's life (there's even a title card early in the picture that acknowledges that not all of his life could be compressed into one movie). This, for the most part, is a good choice, since you're allowed to gradually see and understand how Gandhi got India to break away from Great Britain, and, eventually, struggled to keep it one nation. For the first 140 minutes or so, the film is pretty well paced, although it's reverential attitude towards Gandhi did make me wonder if there was something more complex behind his character. The last 40 minutes, while they make the movie drag, do at least challenge Gandhi's notions, as he is forced to confront the fact that his intelligent speeches and periods of long fasting will not be enough to alleviate a long religious conflict between Muslims and Hindus (which lead to the creation of Pakistan). Notice how, when Gandhi claims to be a man of all faiths, a Hindu, not a Muslim, later assassinated him.Though I think some trimming of the time could have helped, this is nonetheless a good looking and well acted epic and also intelligently addresses some issues that still affect us today. Do tyrants always fall? Or are the people who stand against them bound to fall as well? For me, that seemed to be the question the film posed at the end.

I think it was late last summer when I first watched this adaptation of the Old Yeller novel by Fred Gipson, and from what I remember, I was impressed with a lot of it, but later on, I wasn't so sure anymore. I watched The Shaggy Dog, another live action Disney dog movie from the 50's featuring Tommy Kirk and Kevin Corcoran playing brothers, for the first time just this week. Shortly after watching that film and being fairly impressed with it, I have watched Old Yeller for the second time, and would say it was better for me than it was the first time, and also better than the other Disney dog movie I've mentioned, which I was expecting.In 1860's Texas, Jim Coates leaves his ranch to take part in a cattle drive, and won't be back for several months. On the ranch, he leaves behind his wife, Katie, and two sons Travis and Arliss. Travis, the older of the two brothers, is left to take his father's responsibilities. Shortly after his father leaves, Travis happens to be working outside when a stray yellow dog comes, scares the family mule, and makes it knock down the fence! Travis angrily chases this dog away, but the next day, he finds him back on the ranch already! Arliss has decided to adopt this dog, but after the trouble the mutt has already caused, Travis obviously doesn't want him around. However, the older Coates brother begins to have a change of heart when he discovers that the meat he left out overnight has surprisingly not been touched by the dog. It soon turns out that Old Yeller is a big help for Travis as he takes on the responsibilities of his absent father, and the two develop a strong bond, but there is some trouble ahead.This movie has a small cast, but most of the few who had roles in it put on decent performances, even if some are slightly flawed. Dorothy McGuire and Fess Parker as the Coates parents, Tommy Kirk as Travis (one of his many Disney roles), and actor\/athlete Chuck Connors in the smaller role of Burn Sanderson, are all notable cast performances. On the other hand, I did not care much for Jeff York as the lazy, fast-talking Bud Searcy, or Beverly Washburn as Bud's daughter, Lisbeth, and when these two characters first appear, I've found that they may temporarily bring the entertainment value down a bit, but fortunately, they aren't usually a problem. For the most part, the plot is an intriguing one, with what Travis and Old Yeller go through together and the boy's initial reaction to the dog followed by the strong bond they develop. Obviously, SO many others have pointed this out, but parts of the film certainly are emotional as well, which also helps keep it from being underwhelming and forgettable. They also picked some nice, scenic filming locations for this particular live action Disney film.I'm sure many people through the generations have seen this movie in their childhood, but I didn't, so I obviously don't know what that's like. This certainly isn't the happiest movie a kid could watch, but its reputation shows that it clearly has pleased many of those who saw it as kids, so I guess it has succeeded with that goal as the decades have gone by, and likely continues to do so today. Many adults like this Old Yeller adaptation as well, which I can understand after seeing it myself. In my opinion, there are some weaker parts of the film, so I can't rate it as highly as some voters, but overall, it's a solid effort that has aged well. If you haven't seen this successful 1957 Disney animal movie, I will say that should you do decide to watch it, some parts could make you cry if you're an emotional kind of person, or maybe even if you're not that emotional (though I didn't cry), but this is a major reason why it's so widely remembered and praised.

On the ranch, he leaves behind his wife, Katie, and two sons Travis and Arliss. Travis, the older of the two brothers, is left to take his father's responsibilities. Shortly after his father leaves, Travis happens to be working outside when a stray yellow dog comes, scares the family mule, and makes it knock down the fence! Travis angrily chases this dog away, but the next day, he finds him back on the ranch already! Arliss has decided to adopt this dog, but after the trouble the mutt has already caused, Travis obviously doesn't want him around. However, the older Coates brother begins to have a change of heart when he discovers that the meat he left out overnight has surprisingly not been touched by the dog. It soon turns out that Old Yeller is a big help for Travis as he takes on the responsibilities of his absent father, and the two develop a strong bond, but there is some trouble ahead.This movie has a small cast, but most of the few who had roles in it put on decent performances, even if some are slightly flawed. Dorothy McGuire and Fess Parker as the Coates parents, Tommy Kirk as Travis (one of his many Disney roles), and actor\/athlete Chuck Connors in the smaller role of Burn Sanderson, are all notable cast performances. On the other hand, I did not care much for Jeff York as the lazy, fast-talking Bud Searcy, or Beverly Washburn as Bud's daughter, Lisbeth, and when these two characters first appear, I've found that they may temporarily bring the entertainment value down a bit, but fortunately, they aren't usually a problem. For the most part, the plot is an intriguing one, with what Travis and Old Yeller go through together and the boy's initial reaction to the dog followed by the strong bond they develop. Obviously, SO many others have pointed this out, but parts of the film certainly are emotional as well, which also helps keep it from being underwhelming and forgettable. They also picked some nice, scenic filming locations for this particular live action Disney film.I'm sure many people through the generations have seen this movie in their childhood, but I didn't, so I obviously don't know what that's like. This certainly isn't the happiest movie a kid could watch, but its reputation shows that it clearly has pleased many of those who saw it as kids, so I guess it has succeeded with that goal as the decades have gone by, and likely continues to do so today. Many adults like this Old Yeller adaptation as well, which I can understand after seeing it myself. In my opinion, there are some weaker parts of the film, so I can't rate it as highly as some voters, but overall, it's a solid effort that has aged well. If you haven't seen this successful 1957 Disney animal movie, I will say that should you do decide to watch it, some parts could make you cry if you're an emotional kind of person, or maybe even if you're not that emotional (though I didn't cry), but this is a major reason why it's so widely remembered and praised.

As can be seen by anyone who has actually watched The Last Temptation of Christ, this is a misunderstanding of its message. Director Martin Scorsese, for whom this was a cherished project, is a Catholic, as was the man upon whose novel the movie is based Nikos Kazantzikos, and the story aims to explore and clarify the nature of Christ and his sacrifice. Besides, maybe the pictures fundamentalist critics should be a little more positive about its impact upon audiences. I am an atheist; this is the only one of the many pictures of the Jesus myth that has moved me emotionally.Aside from its content, The Last Temptation of Christ is a profoundly beautiful piece of cinema. I normally find Scorsese's style as a director rather distracting and excessive, but here he is simply note perfect, orchestrating the picture with sensitive rhythm and delicate control. In the opening scenes we are introduced to a young Jesus troubled by the voice of God. The camera is prowling, moody, somewhat detached from the setting. Then Judas bursts in, venting his anger upon Jesus, and suddenly everything is very tight and focused, close to the action with lots of cuts. Finally, as Judas calms, the camera becomes still, the shots longer, and there is a wonderful moment as a flock of sheep passes by behind Harvey Keitel, a visual release of tension. Throughout the picture the tone is set through camera movement, slow-motion, the use of sound disappearing and reappearing, and the haunting Peter Gabriel score. This overtly stylised approach is not one that works well for drama, but it gives this picture a stirring, meditative quality that is very appropriate, and breathtaking to behold.The Last Temptation of Christ is a loving presentation of the Jesus story which shows him to be as much a human as a deity; flawed, tempted, terrified by his own fate. This is not only a Christ one can empathise with, it is a Christ whose sacrifice has an appropriate magnitude because we can see it is not something he goes into lightly. Actor Willem Dafoe expertly treads the line between the human man and god made flesh in a performance that is a world away from the stuffy, lifeless, stained-glass window depictions that have gone before it.

I have always loved heist movies, it's always fun to root for the bad guys. It reminded me a lot of Oceans 11 which I'm sure was actually inspired in part by this film. Not much time is spent developing any of the characters, which i think made it pretty much emotionless. That is not a bad thing necessarily. It got a bit confusing with all the jumping from one characters story to the next and moving forwards and backwards through time, but everything fell into place when the actual heist happens. One aspect that did get on my nerves however is that every time the race announcer would speak there was a shot of the megaphones to, i guess make it known that the voice was coming from the speakers. I know that some people might get confused between the narrator and the announcer, but i believe it's a fairly obvious distinction. One scene really reminded me of director Quentin Tarantino's style. The scene where all the heist members are waiting for Johnny Clay to bring the money and two men show up to steal it from them and everyone ends getting shot and killed except for George. I can really see how this movie has inspired many modern films. ","genre":null},{"date":"7 April 2011","score":"","review":" Being considered a B-list movie i have to say this was great.

After being evicted from the land they'd farmed for generations, they join many other Okie families migrating to California seeking opportunities to work. In California the Okies were often taken advantage of by affluent land owners who promised fair wages but then paid half what they promised. Those migrants who resisted exploitation were sometimes viewed (and treated) as reds; local police (or private security agents) were too often used to intimidate or quell resistance. Steinbeck's criticism of such exploitation of workers led to banning the book in some places although it became quite popular through most of the US and led to reforms. Henry Fonda's role as Tom Joad earned his stardom; Jane Darwell (as Ma Joad) won a deserved Oscar for best supporting actress as did John Ford for directing.Steinbeck was very critical of an economic system that allowed such mistreatment of sharecroppers and tenant farmers by wealthy land owners, bankers, etc., (supported by local officials wherever the owners\/bankers resided). But while the movie piles worst case on worst case, IMO it's a fair view of how bad things sometimes got in the Great Depression era (1929-40). I spent 2 summers (1949, 1950) in the Bootheel of Missouri working in communities of former sharecroppers who'd been evicted from their jobs and their shack homes in circumstances parallel to that of the Okie families. These evictions happened when the owners of the cotton plantations, after receiving federal agricultural subsidies for NOT growing cotton, decided to keep all the money for themselves by evicting their farm families (January, 1939), making thousands homeless.The tenant farmer\/sharecropper system was based on the land owners providing substandard housing to farm families plus advancing them credit (in their company stores) for food, clothing, and seed. In return the farm families planted, tilled, and picked the cotton. But their share of return from the cotton harvest was never sufficient to get out of debt to the store. The system made the farm families, in essence, indentured servants. Until they were kicked out.While the motivations (land owners' greed, farm families' struggles to survive in extreme circumstances) and conflicts were very similar to what the Okies experienced, the resolution of this Bootheel crisis became far more uplifting and inspiring than the struggles without victors presented in the Grapes of Wrath.
