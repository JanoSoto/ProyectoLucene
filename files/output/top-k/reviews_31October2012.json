I was also opportune to see clips of the movie Run Lola Run, and a music video featuring the star.Well I never forgot about the movie, but I never thought I could one day find German movies. Well thanks to the global world becoming more unified I did and it was a good price to pay to see Run Lola Run finally after 14 years.Mind you it is a German movie subtitled in English.The movie stars Franka Potente, who you can remember as Jason Bourne's love interest in the Bourne film series and as Eva Heissan in the British American show on BBC America Copper.Run Lola Run shows the place of determination in human life.The thing that I like most about this flick is the use of chaos theory's butterfly effect, which tells us how small inputs in the initial condition of the lives of the people in the movie, like running into someone, or distracting them resulted in a drastic change in that individual's life in a large scale in the near future.To show these butterfly effect flash-forward sequences of still images showing the future effect in the future lives of those Lola come across.The Runs in the movie had different implications in the future of each person Lola's path crosses; some were devastating while others were beautiful.The movie plot is straight forward simple; Lola (Franka Potente) and her boyfriend Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu) have a problem.Manni lost 100,000 German Marks (which is about 50,000 Euros) belonging to his crime boss by accidentally leaving it on a train. Lola was supposed to pick him up but she failed because she got sidetracked.Now Manni has to deliver the money in the next 20 mins and he knows if he shows up without it he is dead.Telling Lola all this on the phone caused her to worry and she promised to meet Manni up with the money in 20 mins.So the Runs begin and Lola is seen running to her father hoping to get the money.The film features 3 runs with each different from the first and each presenting a different outcome based on how she reacted to things around her.The movie is directed masterfully by Tom Tykwer who will be working with Tom Hanks and Halle Berry in the 2012 movie Cloud Atlas.If you like a movie that leaves you to pick how it ends then this is for you, like wise if you like an exciting movie just join the band wagon. Mind you again it is German so make sure the one you are watching has subtitles.www.lagsreviews.com ","genre":null},{"date":"31 October 2012","score":"","review":" Way back in 1998, I remember watching a German program on the local TV station, it was there I saw the making and I heard the director and film critics comments about the film.

The fact that he was one of the 13 survivors is pretty ironic considering the severe condition he was born with cerebral palsy. Christy couldn't control his body as if he was in a perpetual battle between his muscles and his will, but destiny, in all mercifulness, left him one avenue to communicate his left foot. Would you think it was thin consolation? For Christy, it was enough he could grab objects, hit the doors and eventually write and paint, express his thoughts, and his torments, for cerebral palsy never affected his capacity to learn, to understand, even to surpass the others' intelligence and sensitivity. My Left Foot is the inspirational story of Christy Brown.Christy's struggle starts within his own family where everyone is convinced that he would never be able to get an education, although he's loved and treated like a Brown, he's the cripple of the Family, not to say the retarded. One of the hardest to watch scenes of the film occurs when the father (Ray McAnnaly in his last performance) helps his boy to do his homework and has to find out what a quarter of 25% is. For him, it doesn't make sense since 25% is already a quarter but poor Christy Brown gets the answer and desperately tries to write 1\/16 with a piece of chalk between his toes, nobody understands. The scene was frustrating and heartbreaking enough to create a totally opposite feeling when Christy writes M-O-T-H- E-R on the floor, the kids cheer, the father is proud and goes buy a drink, Mrs. Brown is overwhelmed, but not that surprised. Hugh O'Connor delivers a magnificent performance, which I'm sure if it was longer, would have earned him more awards.But behind the obligatory cheers, there are more insightful and more thought-provoking lessons to be learned. Mr. Brown refused to put him in an institution, because it would be a disgrace. At that time, they probably didn't expect him to survive or maybe it would cost money but it's on the basis of this decision that the parents allowed Christy to grow up in a normal background, and not have his inspiration being suffocated by medical assistance. Had Christy been born in a rich family, he wouldn't have become this talented artist, and it's even clearer considering the life he had. Brown was treated equally to his brothers, he was toughened by the street, he played soccer, he drank at pubs, he hit and got hit, he was an Irishman in flesh and blood, and it shows all through the film. The genius of Daniel Day-Lewis' performance is to never let the feeling of a one-note personality but on the contrary, convey through his body language, his facial expressions and his burning eyes, a tormenting passion and a ferocious desire to live like everybody and to be loved, he can love but it's all about being loved. The 'love' side is plainly occupied by the other powerful performance of the film, Brenda Fricker (who won the Oscar). She's not just the typical Irish mother, who was pregnant during 16 years (I admit, I counted), she incarnates the capability of a mother to understand her boy. Respect and love are important, but understanding someone is sometimes more valuable. She knows what he feels and even foresees the deceptions. In one movingly intelligent scene, she disapproves Christy's growing affection toward the beautiful doctor Eileen Cole (Fiona Shaw). Something isn't right in Christy's voice, too hopeful. Her motherly instinct doesn't fool her because the hope in Christy is quickly destroyed when Eileen reveals that she's going to be married. Daniel Day-Lewis is so powerful that you could literally see his heart being blown into pieces, and the way the situation becomes more and more out of control, reveals a dark, almost creepy, side in his personality, a dependence to alcohol and an almost childish incapability to accept his condition, his heart suffers much more than the body, but who could blame him?The power of My Left Foot is to rather take an ordinary look of low-budgeted TV family drama rather than a grandiose Hollywood- type biopic, which fits the tone of the film. But it's definitely the three-dimensional, vibrating and passionate Oscar-winning performance of Daniel Day-Lewis that reminds you it's not a TV film. However, the movie is not without a few flaws that don't ruin the overall feeling though. At one scene, the father discovers that his wife was saving money for a wheelchair, we wait for his reaction but then it cuts abruptly to him playing with his kid, tickling him. The mother announces that their daughter is going to marry someone because she's pregnant. Mr. Brown's outburst of rage causes Christy to go into a sort of angry trance, trembling and drooling like a rabid dog, he's eager to kill his father. I thought Christy's reaction was disproportionate regarding an attitude than any father would have, much more in that time. It seemed to me that he was supposed to be a hateful character while he was not. The 'porridge' scene was also confusing because it tried to turn Mr. Brown into a real douche-bag while there were more scenes showing pride than animosity between him and Christy, and nothing to show a sort of complicity between Christy and his sister.Apart from these little details, My Left Foot tells a great story, about a great character, it's not perfect, but what the heck humanity is full of remarkable examples of persons whose talent and hard work allow them to overcame their handicap and to communicate with the rest of the world and if it was not for Jim Sheridan's adaptation of the biographic book My Left Foot and for Daniel Day-Lewis' extraordinary performance, many of us wouldn't have heard of Christy Brown.

In fact, I'm surprised that there wasn't an official complaint from The Yard to Mr Hitchcock for showing them thus in what was supposed to be a serious thriller.The story is unbelievable and, as another reviewer has already written, an insult to high calibre actors such as Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day. (Is there any record of their embarrassment at being sucked into this?). The cameo by Richard Wattis (a one-time very funny British actor) may have given anyone looking at the cast an inkling that this was a farce but then, when he actually appeared, he wasn't cast in a funny part at all. Come to think of it, apart from the ridiculousness of the plot as a whole, there wasn't one funny part in the entire film! What genre would that make it?

These people are not to be taken at face value as their motivations are often complicated by internal and external conflicts that emerge because of issues concerned with their most valued personal relationships and situations that test their levels of commitment, loyalty and trust to the absolute maximum.Dale Mac McKussic (Mel Gibson) and Detective Lieutenant Nick Frescia (Kurt Russell) have been close friends since their high school days but pressure has been brought to bear on their friendship in recent years because they've been working on different sides of the law. Mac, who has recently retired from dealing in drugs, is finding it hard to distance himself from the business as the loss of income involved is causing problems with his estranged wife and this, in turn, could jeopardise the amount of time he gets to spend with his young son. Furthermore, his cousin Gregg (Arliss Howard) is continually pressing him to get involved in some new deals and his long-time friend, a Mexican drug dealer called Carlos, wants him to take part in a very lucrative scheme that he's currently working on.Nick's loyalty to Mac and his obvious unwillingness to arrest him has created tensions in his police work in the past but if Mac has not genuinely retired, then it could transpire that Nick would have no other choice than to arrest him in the near future, especially as his department has received information about a major shipment of drugs that Carlos intends to bring in to L.A. Agent Hal Maguire (J T Walsh) of the Drug Enforcement Agency works closely with Nick and is convinced that Mac is still dealing. The differing attitudes that these men have towards Mac's activities is the cause of continuous conflict between them.Mac and Nick both fall for the beautiful owner of a high class Italian restaurant. Jo Ann Vallenari (Michelle Pfeiffer) is very cool. sophisticated and measured in what she says but is undeniably attracted to both men. Nick makes the mistake of trying to use his relationship with her to illicit information about Mac and Carlos and this makes her turn her attention more strongly to Mac who she finds to be far more sincere. Meanwhile, a joint operation involving the D.E.A. and the Mexican police led by Commandante Xavier Escalante (Raul Julia) is under way to capture Carlos and of course, anyone doing business with him.Tequila Sunrise is a visual treat with great camera-work, lighting and beautiful scenes such as the one in which Mac and Nick are shown in silhouette against a stunning background. Their darkened figures seem to emphasise the closeness of their friendship because when seen purely as two shadowed profiles, the differences and conflicts between them appear to become insignificant.Mel Gibson conveys the uncertainty that his character experiences during a period in his life when he's feeling more apprehensive and vulnerable than he has in the past and Kurt Russell successfully makes Nick's mixture of genuine and manipulative characteristics seem perfectly believable. Michelle Pfeiffer displays great poise but is also convincing in showing her emotional reactions to certain situations and Raul Julia and J T Walsh are terrific in their supporting roles.Not enough attention seems to have been given to the pacing of the action in this movie but overall, it is extremely entertaining to watch and contains some witty dialogue.

Too be completely honest, I see this more like a comedy. At moments, I thought that it was some sort of parody of the stories written by Stephen King.Quitters, Inc. was the most absurd and random of the three stories. (I mean, even if the Clinic counselor is with the mafia, all what he did just to make one character stop smoking is unnecessarily complicated. What does he had to win anyway doing all that? And at end, why Dick Morrison still acts friendly towards the same counselor, as if nothing had happened?)Everything was so cheesy and over the top in that part of the movie, but that's the main reason of why it was so funny to watch. I can even picture Quitters, Inc. as being the plot of one South Park episode due the absurdity of it.The second story, The Ledge, was the most boring one. It had a couple of funny moments, but I found it to be completely forgettable for most part.The third story, General was the most interesting one, without being so cheesy as Quitters, Inc. Even when it could be seen as something dated by modern viewers, I think it is still worth-watching. I liked the idea of one cat being the hero of the story, opposed to the tired cliché of the evil cat, which became so common in cartoons and horror films. The Troll character reminded me of the movie Gremlins, and yet, I think that it was one of the most interesting characters from this film, which were mostly stereotypes.Cat's Eye without being a masterpiece, at least provides a decent amount of entertainment value that other horror movies lack, specially those that take themselves way too seriously to the point of being pretentious.

There is simply nothing bad about this film that'll make you want to hate it.Every scene from Titanic from start to finish is fantastic; the love scenes to the final moments. You'll find yourself getting way into the plot, as well as feeling for the characters.Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are brilliant as Jack and Rose. Once they enter the picture, you cannot help but love any moment they spend together, and their forbidden romance is so emotional and powerful.The ship's final moments will keep you on the edge of your seat as well as shock you. James Cameron does an excellent job of recreating the sinking. It's hard to imagine that a horrible incident like this happened 100 years ago. Cameron marvels at bringing the disaster to life.On the whole, Titanic is a wonderful movie. Nothing can describe the sheer greatness coming out of it.
