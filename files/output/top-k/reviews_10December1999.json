Portman is an excellent actress and has a great deal of presence which makes her delightful to watch.  Ewan McGregor was very good in his portrayal of the young Obi Wan, and did an extraordinary job of emulating Sir Alec Guinness' style in previous performances.I can see why reviews for the film were mixed.

The storyline is confusing at times, and it is hard to identify with some of the characters.  The Jar Jar Binks character is definitely annoying but not as bad as I thought he would be.I think Episode One's big failure lies in its comparison to the previous three films.  No matter how good the writing and directing is, it is impossible to stack up to the Star Wars mystique that is attached to the saga.  The feeling is similar to the feeling one would get if a studio today remade a Casablanca or a Gone With the Wind.

A lot of child actors aren't very good (which is understandable), but Portman gives a great performance in this film.  I really wish Jean Reno starred in more films, it seems like he only has supporting roles in all the other ones I've seen him in.  Gary Oldman turns in one of the great villian performances of recent history.As much as I enjoy Hong Kong action films by directors such as John Woo and Ringo Lam, it's nice to see an action film done in a different style like this one is.    I haven't seen much French action other than Besson's films, most of the European action I've seen are Italian films from the 70s and 80s like with Franco Nero, Tomas Milian, and Maurizio Merli.  Some are good, a lot are pretty forgettable.  Leon kind of puts me in mind of a modern-set spaghetti western, like a lot of Italian actioners (a lot of which were made by people who got their start making westerns, like Enzo G. Castellari).  I think Leon really stands out from other European-made actioners, and I also think it's a really unique film in the action-crime genre.  Granted, the basic concept of the story may not be unique, but it's what Besson does with it that makes it unique.As I've said in other commentaries of Besson films, I think he has a really great visual style.  When you talk about the look of the film, production designer Dan Weil and cinematographer Thierry Arbogast definately deserve credit, both of them also worked on La Femme Nikita and The Fifth Element. The music by Eric Serra is very good too.*****Possible Minor Spoilers in next paragraph********If you're really interested in this film, do yourself a favor and seek out the extended version.  With a lot of directors' cuts, the additional scenes are interesting, but not essential to the plot, and you can see why they were cut to streamline the film; but this one is different.  I think the American version of the film (under the really lame re-title The Professional) is damaged by the absence of the 20 minutes of footage that was cut from it.  With the possible exception of one or two scenes, I think everything that was cut is essential to the story.  What's possibly my favorite sequence in the movie (when Leon takes Matilda on a series of assignments, and she puts gum over the peepholes of the apartments they go to) was cut from the American version, I think it's interesting that part of this sequence foreshadows the ending (I won't say how for those of you who haven't seen it yet).  There's also an explanation of what Tony meant when he said that Leon had gotten in trouble over a woman before, which also explains why Leon doesn't return Matilda's sexual advances (I really dislike how the American version leaves the issue of their relationship unresolved by the absence of this scene, and I think having them wake up in bed together without this scene is just sloppy.)  Still, this is far from the worst American tampering with a Besson film.The climax of the film is just an incredible piece of filmmaking, comparable to the Peckinpah-style church shootout at the end of John Woo's The Killer. Even though Besson's other films are very good too, I think this is his masterpiece to date, and just a great film any way you slice it.  It's one of my top ten favorite movies.  Go rent it right now if you haven't already, If you have a DVD player, go rent the DVD, Leon, like all Besson films, simply must be seen letterboxed, much like Sergio Leone's films.  Besson's brilliant shot composition is just ruined by pan and scanning.

Go rent it right now if you haven't already, If you have a DVD player, go rent the DVD, Leon, like all Besson films, simply must be seen letterboxed, much like Sergio Leone's films.  Besson's brilliant shot composition is just ruined by pan and scanning. ","genre":"Crime, Drama, Thriller"},{"date":"10 December 1999","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  A common theme throughout the films of Luc Besson is that his characters are like Charles Bronson in Once Upon a Time in the West, They've got something inside, something to do with death, this theme had certainly been explored before in The Big Blue and La Femme Nikita, but I think it reaches it's peak with this film.The three leads (Reno, Portman, and Oldman) are just perfect in their roles, I have a hard time imagining anyone else playing them.  A lot of child actors aren't very good (which is understandable), but Portman gives a great performance in this film.  I really wish Jean Reno starred in more films, it seems like he only has supporting roles in all the other ones I've seen him in.  Gary Oldman turns in one of the great villian performances of recent history.As much as I enjoy Hong Kong action films by directors such as John Woo and Ringo Lam, it's nice to see an action film done in a different style like this one is.    I haven't seen much French action other than Besson's films, most of the European action I've seen are Italian films from the 70s and 80s like with Franco Nero, Tomas Milian, and Maurizio Merli.  Some are good, a lot are pretty forgettable.  Leon kind of puts me in mind of a modern-set spaghetti western, like a lot of Italian actioners (a lot of which were made by people who got their start making westerns, like Enzo G. Castellari).  I think Leon really stands out from other European-made actioners, and I also think it's a really unique film in the action-crime genre.  Granted, the basic concept of the story may not be unique, but it's what Besson does with it that makes it unique.As I've said in other commentaries of Besson films, I think he has a really great visual style.  When you talk about the look of the film, production designer Dan Weil and cinematographer Thierry Arbogast definately deserve credit, both of them also worked on La Femme Nikita and The Fifth Element. The music by Eric Serra is very good too.*****Possible Minor Spoilers in next paragraph********If you're really interested in this film, do yourself a favor and seek out the extended version.  With a lot of directors' cuts, the additional scenes are interesting, but not essential to the plot, and you can see why they were cut to streamline the film; but this one is different.  I think the American version of the film (under the really lame re-title The Professional) is damaged by the absence of the 20 minutes of footage that was cut from it.  With the possible exception of one or two scenes, I think everything that was cut is essential to the story.  What's possibly my favorite sequence in the movie (when Leon takes Matilda on a series of assignments, and she puts gum over the peepholes of the apartments they go to) was cut from the American version, I think it's interesting that part of this sequence foreshadows the ending (I won't say how for those of you who haven't seen it yet).  There's also an explanation of what Tony meant when he said that Leon had gotten in trouble over a woman before, which also explains why Leon doesn't return Matilda's sexual advances (I really dislike how the American version leaves the issue of their relationship unresolved by the absence of this scene, and I think having them wake up in bed together without this scene is just sloppy.)  Still, this is far from the worst American tampering with a Besson film.The climax of the film is just an incredible piece of filmmaking, comparable to the Peckinpah-style church shootout at the end of John Woo's The Killer. Even though Besson's other films are very good too, I think this is his masterpiece to date, and just a great film any way you slice it.  It's one of my top ten favorite movies.

She says the shark deliberately killed Sean cuz' he's a Brody and that Sheriff Broady died of his heart attack years ago cuz' he was thinking about the shark.  So Eileen wants to get away from sharks.  Hmm, Nebraska? Iran? NO! Bermuda!!! Not only that, but this shark somehow got the Brody's flight arrangements and swam to the exact right island before they even arrived!  Aside from the fact that this is completely ridiculous, a question comes to mind.  If there is a drive behind this shark what is it? Is it the same shark from the previous flicks and just keeps regrouping itself like the T-1000?  Or is simply a family member?Anyway, Mike Brody works down at the Bahamas with his Jamaican stereotype friend collecting conch shells.  Oh did I fail to mention that every time a Broady family member is attacked, Ellen's shark radar hits in? She can be clear across another island parting with Mike Caine and just go into trances. No need to worry though.  Michael Brody can escape no just the shark, but the bends by using his oxygen tank to shoot himself to the surface.Bad plot, bad acting, bad writing, maybe you can just sit back, hit the mute and just watch the flick like a mindless slasher, WRONG!  The body count is 2 (maybe 3), and the shark is the most fake piece of muppet scraps ever put in the water! And the people who do get killed just fall into the shark's gaping mouth! no lie!

In flashbacks where no other living human could remember!! I've learned there is a directors cut of this movie.  They completely changed the ending for home video.  I thought for a second Damn right they changed it!.  I see the movie, all they changed was allowing the Jamaican guy to live! That's it!

With such a primal fear bubbling in every driver's psyche, it's little wonder canny film-makers have been keen to exploit this. Many have been keen to try with a host of TV movies usually starring Robert Urich and Meredith Baxter Birney, credibility often taking a back seat to the cliched scripts.However, while those are best forgotten, there are three great movies about highway horror that usually involve something a little more sinister than just looking for gas in the middle of a dust-laden desert.Steven Spielberg directed the first, Duel, in the early Seventies; a terrific thriller with Dennis Weaver as a humble motorist terrorised by an unhinged trucker (who we never see).The second was The Vanishing, George Sluizer's Dutch nail-biter about a young man desperately searching for his girlfriend after she disappears from a motorway service station.Taking elements from both of the above, writer\/director Jonathan Mostow created the third Breakdown, an all too feasible thriller which rarely shifts out of top gear - until the third act. In the early days of production, things didn't look promising. Kurt Russell had just made the derivative yawnfest Escape From LA and Mostow's previous movies, Beverly Hills Bodysnatchers and Flight of the Black Angel, were far from classics.To say both director and star pulled out all the stops is something of an understatement.

The kid's all-thumbs acting?  The completely undeveloped relationship between Jedi master and apprentice?  The dull, unscary villains?  The human warmth of the scenes in which the kid leaves his mom forever without even a goodbye?  Trying to figure out which one is the queen dressed as her servant and which one is the servant dressed as the queen dressed as the servant (like it matters)?  Watching the best years of Ewan Mcgregor's career be wasted talking bilge about midi-chronthians or whatever they were?This is shockingly inept filmmaking, illogical even on its own terms-- Jedis blather so much about sensing the force, but Obli-Da can't sense a Dark Lord coming up behind him on a scooter-- and bad at everything we used to go to movies for (and even got a little from Lucas's early movies).  Lucas plainly doesn't know that what made the originals enjoyable was the presence of a character mocking the whole business (Han Solo); now he takes himself as seriously as those dull Star Wars imitations (Krull, The Dark Crystal, etc.) that followed in his wake.

If in Shane violence is viewed as a necessary evil only to be employed as a last resort, and killing is depicted as fast and pure, in The Wild Bunch violence is viewed with exaltation, and killing is prolonged, tormented, and bloody...Shane delivered an old traditional story, a legend, a fabulous hero who idealized the West... The Wild Bunch presents it stormy, disturbing, hard to control, and blood-thirsty... In short, within the genre of the Western, The Wild Bunch is the precise opposite of Shane. Each film may be considered an artifact of a view of the American frontier... Shane, made during the quietude of 1953, romanticizes and idealizes... The Wild Bunch, made fifteen years later in a turbulent time, tells us that the American Dream is dead...The opening sequence of The Wild Bunch stakes out the virtue of the wild territory... A gang of desperadoes disguised as U. S. soldiers rides into a town, passing children torturing scorpions and adults attending a temperance meeting... The action starts inside the office when Pike, the leader of the bunch warns his men saying 'If they move, kill'em!'The Bunch robs the railway office, then finds itself ambushed by a gang of bounty hunters working for the railroad... A savage gunfight erupts, many innocents people are killed, and in few minutes, we discover that we are in middle of a territory full of rage and fury, in a terrain that is beyond good or evil, where the abusing use of force is beyond any reason...Holden's group was never easy to handle... There is conflict and tension among them&#133; They range from the more idealistic Mexican member, Jaime Sanchez, to the wild Gorch brothers, Warren Oates and Ben Johnson&#133; But what binds them together in the last resort is their life-style and its demanding loyalty&#133; Holden puts it this way 'When you side with a man, you stay with him, and if you can't do that, you're some kind of animal, you're finished.

Mel Gibson carried it exactly and excessively, in his superb epic tale Braveheart, when he showed us how a lovely bride is slain in the same way... His film was probably influenced by The Wild Bunch at least &#150; as I think &#150; with its technique and style...The 'savor' of violence in 'slow motion' makes us understand the passion of Peckinpah toward violence... This pleasure for killing, this irresistible exhibition, this 'performance of death' as Peckinpah expressed it himself, could be interpreted maybe as criticism to violence...The Wild Bunch is splendidly acted... William Holden as Pike, was never so magnificent since Stalag 17 as I remember... It seems that Holden understood the message, specially in the brilliant scene when he clearly decides to rescue one of his men... This particular shot was outstanding because it involved Holden in a great embarrassment with zero dialog...

It's brutality is not captured here in terms of gory carnage or senseless battles.  Instead, the psychological dimension of brutality comes across clearly.

Islam can have arranged marriages, in which the children have no influence of their own. And of course Islam states that the father decides on the family affairs and everybody else has to obey.British culture in the seventies was of course very different.

Children learned to think for themselves to the point of rebelling against the parents if necessary.Those are the two scenes in this family. The children have grown up in British culture and adapted brilliantly to it (i.e. they like pork meat, disco, alcohol and wanting to make decide for themselves), but the father wants to put Islamic principles on his whole family when it comes to religion and arranged marriages. This of course creates major conflicts and that is how the movie starts. The oldest son walking out of an arranged marriage on the wedding day. In Islam this is a disgrace to the family and the father is ultimately responsible.In the end the conflict heats up so much that the father has no other option than to use violence against the only child that wants to live the life the father wants him to live and against his western wife, brilliantly portrayed by Linda Basset.

It's directed by Sergio Leone, best known for his spaghetti westerns with Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef.  From what I've read, Leone had this film in mind since the mid-60's, but the studio wanted another western, so the brilliant Once Upon a Time in the West was made, then the flawed but very interesting Mexican revolution epic A Fistful of Dynamite, and then Leone produced, co-wrote, and directed a few scenes (uncredited, Tonino Valerii was credited as director) of the lesser-known-than-it-should-be Western Comedy My Name Is Nobody.  I think the way Leone directs his first (and unfortunately last) gangster film is interesting to contrast with those of Francis Ford Copolla and Martin Scorsese.The film has the feeling of a guilt-ridden, drug-fueled nightmare; few films have been able to capture this feeling so effectively.  The cinematography by Tonino Delli Colli which creates a very dreamlike rather than realistic look, and the excellent haunting score by the great Ennio Morricone (a grade school classmate of Leone and his regular composer from A Fistful of Dollars on, interestingly enough, the score was composed a whole seven years before filming began) contribute a lot to this feeling.  Morricone would later borrow from himself a little when composing the score for Brian DePalma's film The Untouchables.  The first time I saw this film, it stayed with me for days.  The structuring of the film is very unique too, jumping from the 1930s to the 60s back to the 20s, none feels like the present, they all swirl together.A very unique film, don't let the almost-four-hours running time scare you off, I've watched it several times, and it doesn't feel like almost four hours.  The film is structured so elegantly, I can't imagine cutting a minute.  (definately only watch the 226 minute version, the original theatrical release was re-edited and shortened signifigantly, which, needless to say, was quite damaging).

For all the time they spend introducing Neo and idea of The Matrix, they kind of drop all the supporting cast into the film to try and make us believe it's not all about Neo, Trinity and Morpheus.The special-effects in this movie are outstanding, and have set the standard for eye-candy movies, basically the 1999 Independence Day.  With the advent of digital film technology via Lucasfilms, I have a feeling special effects will surpass themselves tenfold in the next ten years alone.  But for now this is the king of an ever-changing mountain.  In the meantime, the Wachowski brothers demonstrated that there is still room in Hollywood for creative camera work.  Some of the shots are outstanding, and even with the most subtle and understated shots, you get the idea that every single shot and angle is exactly where it is meant to be, for a very specific purpose. The cinematography is, to me, the real gem of the film, the diamond in the middle of an above-average story and above-average acting. The Messianic theme is prevalent in science fiction so this movies is easily compared, not only to Star Wars, but any number of sci-fi films and Japanese anime features.  But all in all, I think this film is an outstanding effort, it will be a crime when it doesn't get a Best Picture nomination, and I can't wait for 2 and 3.

After Tomorrow Never Dies this TWINE could only be better, but the outcome was very enjoyable. Classic Bond, the best. The argue about Sean Connery Vs. Pierce Brosnan will continue but to me is clear at this point that Pierce is the best as an international mistery invencible man. Sophie Marceau was the perfect casting. Sophie has done for modern Bond what the ever lasting Pussy Galore did for the old one. Charm, excitation The true Bond Girl!.
