Evil (along with a clone 1\/6 his size - played by Verne J. Troyer) has sent Fat Bastar# back to the sixties to steal Powers' mojo while he is cryogenically frozen. Without his mojo, Powers is nothing. So 90's Austin travels back to the 1960's to claim back his mojo - along with Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham) - from a time-traveling Dr. Evil.This sequel is a lot different than the first film. The first seemed to be more of a spoof on the spy\/James Bond genre. This movie, however, runs a bit more on Powers and his mojo - not a whole lot of Bond spoofs here. But that doesn't mean the jokes aren't any good.Dr. Evil has much more screen time in this sequel, and I'm happy for that. Dr. Evil is a character we didn't see a whole lot of in the original, and in this film, he has just as much - if not more - screen time than Powers himself (it sounds weird referring to them as different actors - they're both Myers!).Mike Myers is just as funny as he was in the first film. I recently viewed So I Married an Axe Murderer for the second and a half time, and I realized that Myers really isn't as funny when he's playing someone close to himself. His character in So I... isn't as shy as Myers is in real life, but he talks, looks, walks, smiles, and dresses like Myers. Myers as Powers is entirely different, however - he's about twenty times funnier. Not that Myers isn't funny, but you'll notice he is much more funny dressed up as someone else. Look at his Saturday Night Live skits and you'll see that Myers' best skits were those when he dressed up as different people (i.e. the Scottish Crap Store man).Heather Graham may not be the most talented actress, and I especially found her over--or under--acting in this film compared to her performances in Boogie Nights and Bowfinger--but I think she may have done that on purpose. As we all know, Bond girls usually aren't the best actresses, so perhaps she over\/under-acted as a parody on Bond films.

I figure that you should stick with a movie, through good times and bad. First of all, I don't like wasting money on something. Secondly, I like to see it all just to say I saw it. Third of all, I see it all so I can review it.So I sat through this film the first time, but it was painful the second and third, and I found myself going over to the computer and typing up some reviews instead. The movie isn't all that bad in the beginning, other than having a few outrageous stunts (even for a Bond film), but it's from the midway on that bores me. It just becomes dull.This Bond outing features Pierce Brosnan going after some baddies bent on doing something somewhere, for some reason or another. All I could make out was that there is a guy with a bullet in his brain that slowly eats away his pain receptors, making him immune to pain. That is the excuse for an indestructible bad guy who stands a chance against Bond.Bond teams up with Sophie Marceau to track down the bad guy, but soon finds himself with Bond Girl Denise Richards, playing Christmas Jones Short pants, tight shirt covering big breasts, and big lips. Oh, yeah She's a nuclear chemist out in the middle of nowhere with a bunch of other chemists--all stupid men that dress decently and actually look like someone who would have gone through years of chemistry instead of vogue class. Now, I can accept beautiful women in most Bond films It's the franchise's strongest trait. Or one of the strongest traits. But having Denise Richards play a nuclear chemist is beyond belief It's truly laughable!Pierce Brosnan once again proves to be a great Bond runner-up I'll be saddened when he stops playing the character.

Michael Goorjian also delivers a strong performance (and he looked just like my best friend too) but then we get to the downfalls of the film.1. The plot itself is really weak and the meaning is, at best, weak, and, at worst, contradictory. The scenes themselves are good but the problem is when they are combined, the sum of the whole is less then the sum of the parts.2. The breaking of the fourth wall in the film (not really a spoiler since it happens in the first ten minutes or so) DOES provide interesting insight about one-third of the time, the rest of the time it is just jarring and actually takes away from the film.3. The environment is not used to its fullest effect.

It is a great film about friendship and it is very sweet. All the actors gave great performances, especially Judd Nelson. I enjoyed him in this one because he actually played a sweet and likeable character. His character Phil was great and it was so funny when he would always get picked on by his friends. Gardner Barnes (Kevin Costner) was funny and he was likeable. The only thing I didn't understand about this film was the character of Suzy Amis. What was that about? I know she got married to one of the buddies but why was Gardner thinking of her and him together? I don't know. Maybe I just wasn't paying that much attention. Anyways. One of the funniest scenes in this film is when Phil says Do you know what E means? Do you know what E means? It means EMPTY douchebag! Like your head! and the buddies attach a rope from Phil's Caddy to a moving train and it takes the whole front of the car off. I felt so sorry for Phil. But anyways.

Especially the music and the movies. And The Breakfast Club is one of my absolute favorite '80s movies. It stars the members of the Brat Pack, which I'm a big fan of, it has a great '80s song, (Don't You Forget About Me by Simple Minds), and it has great '80s dialogue. This was a great story about how five totally different kids have to spend a whole day in detention together and they end up finding out that they each have a lot in common and they end up becoming friends. I liked all the characters, but all of them had something that annoyed me. Andrew (Emilio Estevez) was way too cocky and too much of a jock, Brian (Anthony Michael Hall) was too dorky and a brainiac, John (Judd Nelson) was way too badass and mean, Claire (Molly Ringwald) was too much of a popular prom queen and I just thought she was full of herself, and Alison (Ally Sheedy) was too much of a wierdo. But I didn't hate any of the characters. I think my favorite character was John Bender. (I will always love Judd Nelson). Most of the funniest lines in the movie were said by him and he wasn't too arrogant. But he was so mean. That's what I didn't like about him. But he was still funny. The principal, Richard Vernon, (played by Paul Gleason), was good, but I didn't care too much for his attitude. I mean, I know that he had to be extremely rude towards John because that's what John did to him, but it was still unlikeable. Anyways.
