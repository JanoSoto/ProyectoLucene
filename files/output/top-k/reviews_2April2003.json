Following on from 'The Great Dictator' and 'Monsieur Verdoux', Chaplin eschews his physical comedy for the most part, preferring to address 'big themes' and important issues. 'The Great Dictator', quite obviously tackles fascism and the demagoguery of a dictator indeed pretty pertinent in 1940. 'Verdoux' is an interesting one-off in its inherent darkness; the material, concerning a mannered serial killer, is treated with more sobriety and a blacker touch than had hence been the case with Chaplin's films. There is a startling effectiveness to the last reels of that film, with Chaplin's theme of society forming the individual's behaviour being emphatically and eerily conveyed by his well-spoken character. 'Limelight' focuses on the gold mine that is Chaplin's career and the decline of his sort of comedy. It should be got out of the way first, that considering the possibilities this stirs in the mind, the result will likely disappoint. But that does not affect my view that this is a very interesting film and broadly a successful entertainment. It could be argued that 'The Great Dictator' is a finer insight into Chaplin's art; the masterful pantomime is more vividly on show, and is Hitler is not especially the evil figure we know him to be, but more the manipulative, balletic Chaplin, commanding our attention.'Limelight' seems not to succeed in being a summation of Chaplin's career; perhaps as it distinctly lacks the raison d'être of his visual comedy. Okay, perhaps Calvero is a character based partly on other faded stars from the music hall tradition, but we are not convinced that this is quite the same Chaplin. Of course, this is bound to be the case this is sound cinema, nearly twenty years after the tramp's final sunset-bound trot. But, here Chaplin's character talks incessantly and unrepentantly quite the conversion for the silent clown. Unlike Laurel and Hardy, the adjustment to sound was never made in his original screen persona, so this truly will seem a different Chaplin to viewers. He pontificates in a somewhat lofty, generally admirable fashion; but it is the speech of a mannered, delicate, sentimental old English gentleman, and not a clown or philosopher. There are times his dialogue wades in some very interesting waters - such as that regarding his views on audiences and the rigors of performance - but often, too little of worth is said with too many words, in an overweening, self-satisfied manner. Where the film really succeeds is in the way Chaplin does take on a sort of tragic grandeur towards the close - or more rightly a rather sad grace; a man out of time and out of sympathy with most the world has to offer. It seems he was lucky to obtain the services of Claire Bloom to play the ballerina, Tereza, as she invests a crucial part with genuine feeling and warm brittleness - a good contrast with Chaplin's slightly wearing charm and ghostly drifting through the film. His contribution in bringing Bloom to the screen is to be appreciated, as she went on to a most impressive career in many mediums. Indeed, Bloom is rather histrionic at times, but at least it adds some genuine zest to proceedings. That she carries off this role, that from the evidence we see, is so unlikely &#150; a young girl completely in the thrall of a curiously cold and verbose old man &#150; is a testament to her skill. She really conveys more of Chaplin's appeal than is perhaps warranted by what occurs in the film.Touches like the visual flashbacks of Neville and Tereza's unspoken romance during her voice-over, narrating the story, really help the film. As do the inclusion of performance sequences early on, which are revealed to be in Calvero's subconscious. The second of those rather amused me, seeming atypically Chaplin in its bantering wordplay and slightly otherworldly air. The performing fleas routine is hardly vintage Chaplin (but pray remember, Calvero is a purely music hall performer, of pre-WW1 days) in its invention, but it is very precisely performed. I loved the little bits implying a wider tapestry the drunken musical recitations by Calvero and a few friends in his flat, the reminiscing in a bar. It may not be a picture focused on the details of London life in the era, but tantalizing glimpses are given.It is charming to see faces of old Hollywood, albeit briefly in this picture, that is so dominated by Chaplin's self-regard. Nigel Bruce is a splendid presence as &#150; you've guessed it &#150; a doddering, hapless old buffer with heart certainly in the desired place and dander constantly up. Buster Keaton adds some much needed comedic timing and experience to the film with his late appearance, performing with Chaplin in a decent final routine. He really outshines Chaplin, and it is a shame more isn't seen of his droll presence, far more tangible and concrete than the curiously elusive Chaplin is here. Whatever one's thoughts on the film's comedy, it must be recognized that this is more of a winsome, self-absorbed melodrama than it is anything like a comedy. That it works is surely down to the strange historical interest of the film and its undeniable melancholic resonance. This is a Chaplin at the end of his tether, seemingly unwilling or unable to go back to being a comedian. The film is sad, invested with a grand decay and propped up by perhaps a more &#145;real' Chaplin than was ever seen in his days of silence. It simply should not work &#150; it is a portrait over-egged to some degree - but this is somehow remarkably compelling stuff. The picture all the more mourns what isn't there.

It's as simple as that. What the critics failed to see is an interesting movie about what Hannibal Lecter is like outside the asylum, with his freedom.I was quite disappointed when Jodie Foster didn't reprise her role as Clarice Starling, but Julianne Moore's performance as the ten year after Clarice Starling is just as good, in my opinion. We are talking about a different Clarice Starling, much different from the one we saw and loved in Silence of the Lambs.  In Hannibal, she has realized that the FBI's value systems are beginning to get messed up and with her value systems intact, she doesn't know what direction to go to.  Julianne Moore just delivers such a great performance.  True, there isn't much that she can do with this character, but what she does is still excellent.  Check out the scene where she cries after the *spoiler* fishmarket disaster.  Check out her facial expressions all throughout the final sequence, where they all have that demonic dinner at Paul Krendler's lake house. *end of spoiler*Anthony Hopkins reprises his role as Dr. Hannibal Lecter with a lot of wit, intelligence, and depth.  You see, Hannibal is not supposed to be a horror film.  It's simply a film that shows what Hannibal Lecter is like outside bars.  And it's a very interesting portrayal.  We begin to understand the pathology of this character.  How he eats people, and he reasons that he is doing the public a service.There is a lot of sexual chemistry going on between Hannibal and Clarice Starling.

Bronsman is good here, but not quite as good as in Goldeneye. Even though he has the good action- hero sense, he isn't quite as suave. The writing isn't as good, the characters feel a bit underdeveloped. Also, Jonathen Pyrce's villain is rather annoying and childish, he was way better in the 1985 Terry Gilliam picture, Brazil. Another problem is Michelle Yeoh, who even though she could fight, she didn't speak English too well and her character was rather annoying. However, this film has rather high points. The action sequences, like Goldeneye, are original and innovative. The setting of Hong Kong, Germany, and China's seas are all beautiful and very sharp looking. Also, the henchman Stamper was brilliantly and mencanigly played off by the actor, of whose name I don't know. Even though the ending isn't as good as say the ending of Goldeneye, Tommorow Never Dies ranks as one of the better bond films. 8.5\/10 ","genre":"Action, Adventure, Thriller"},{"date":"2 April 2003","score":"5 out of 9 people found the following review useful","review":"  Videos like 'Senior Trip' are usually in the bargain rack at Walmart for a reason They Suck!

I have been captivated by the subject ever since.  Of course, since seeing this version,back in the early sixties, I have read Walter Lord's book A Night To Remember, saw the movie A Night To Remember based on that book, painfully sat through two terrible TV movies on the subject, was incredibly bored by the fictional, Raise The Titanic, and totally enthralled by James Cameron's definitive (for me) version. This movie remains, on it's own terms, solid big studio Hollywood entertainment.Right at the start we're given a good fictional story, with Barbara Stanwyck taking her two kids on The Titanic, to get them away from her snooty husband, wonderfully played by Clifton Webb in one of his best roles.  In order to get on the ship, Webb must pay a steerage passenger a great deal of money for a ticket, and agreeing to make sure that the steerage passenger's wife and kids make the voyage okay.  This set's up a great scene later on, as the ship is sinking, but it is also about as much of the people on the lower decks that you'll see in this version.The scenes between Clifton Webb and Barbra Stanwyck are outstanding, There is  one scene in particular, when they are arguing about the fate of they're children, that she tells him a long kept secret, that though brief in nature, is played to perfection.    As for the supporting cast, they are not wasted either.  Thelma Ritter, one of the truly great character actors, is excellent as usual.  A young Richard Basehart, as a priest questioning his faith, is not on the screen a lot, yet is quite convincing.  A young Robert Wagner does just fine trying to win the hand of Audrey Dalton who is equally as good as Clifton Webb's snooty daughter.  There are several real life passengers portrayed, such as Isador and Ida Strauss, and their big scene where she refuses to leave her husband behind, is touching and heartbreaking.If you are looking for a realistic account of the sinking of the Titanic, you won't get it here.

Thank GOD Szwarc went on to doing Enigma and Supergirl after this. THEY were good! And Christopher Reeve will always be remembered for-You know whom! No need to remember him in this!

I don't mean everything, but little things.This is just a fun movie to watch. There's a lot of good music (Alice Cooper and Aerosmith!), and the kids are all very believable.

I also liked the fact that the movie wasn't just about getting stoned, even though that is a lot of the movie.

I guess not but I think it has certainly deserved its obvious place in the top ten. I remember what kind of a crazy experience Airheads was when I watched it for the first time and didn't know what to expect. I almost died of hysterical laughter. This movie is so over-filled with terrific, absurd and both idiotic as well as surprisingly clever rock n' roll -oriented humor it's hard to believe anyone could watch it without constantly bursting into laughter. Brendan Fraser and Steve Buscemi are both extravagantly funny and even though I've never really cared for Adam Sandler even he is great in this.

I guess not but I think it has certainly deserved its obvious place in the top ten. I remember what kind of a crazy experience Airheads was when I watched it for the first time and didn't know what to expect. I almost died of hysterical laughter. This movie is so over-filled with terrific, absurd and both idiotic as well as surprisingly clever rock n' roll -oriented humor it's hard to believe anyone could watch it without constantly bursting into laughter. Brendan Fraser and Steve Buscemi are both extravagantly funny and even though I've never really cared for Adam Sandler even he is great in this.

It's well above the routine. Malle knows how to tell a story conventionally, without screaming shock effects or outsize explosions or in-your-face directorial banner headlines. When a pistol is fired, it doesn't boom like dirty Harry's. It simply pops unobtrusively. It all flows along smoothly. And it's aptly titled. The story is as much about Atlantic City as it is about the residents and visitors we meet. It's like a Robert Altman movie except that it has a fascinating narrative that draws us in. We see the city first. A decrepit faux urban setting whose good days are long in the past. (Woodrow Wilson used to summer nearby.) It was called the lungs of Philadelphia. It boomed as a summer resort before commercial airlines vulgarized travel and brought Miami and Bermuda within easy temporal reach of the Northeast corridor. The older apartment buildings, the ones with Queen Anne towers, are being demolished, to be replaced by the casinos that everyone assumes will bring prosperity back. (They never did. The money stayed in the casinos or went out of state.) But those sturdy old brick palaces were built to last and the apartments we see are shabby but cozy too. People have made nests in them over the years. The residents have accomodated their existences to the frames of the places they live in. People work in oyster bars, or run numbers in the falling-apart rubbish-strewn black neighborhoods. They can, if they have the money to do so, dine in reasonably good restaurants or stroll on the boardwalks, and we can almost hear the hoofbeats of yesteryear.What modern Atlantic City is to its brassy past, Burt Lancaster is to his own history. He stalks the streets in his overcoat, wearing the only tie he owns, mutters things about how important he used to be, once having shared a cell with Bugsy Siegal. He used to have to kill people once in a while, he tells a young man confidentially. He always felt bad about it afterward and used to take a long swim in the ocean to feel clean again. I never saw the Atlantic Ocean until today, says the kid. Lancaster turns around and looks out to sea and waves expansively. You should of seen the ocean then, he says. The Atlantic Ocean was really somethin' in them days. His glorious career, it turns out, has about the same epistemological status as that of the city he hasn't been outside of for the past twenty years. The Atlantic Ocean was really somethin' in them days. What a line! And Lancaster handles it well too. He's no Crimson Pirate here, just a quiet older guy with curly white hair trying to make a buck by running errands for small-time hoods, and trying to sell a silver cigarette case, a memento of his past, for a double sawbuck. He looks exactly right too. Not old, exactly, but well aged, like a mature burgundy. His generously featured face hasn't drooped with the passage of the years. His eyebrows are dark and set off his surprisingly gentle eyes. He doesn't clip off the terminal contours of his sentences, as he did before. It's a splendid performance.His performance is matched by that of the other principle actors. There are some quietly amusing episodes between him and the woman he takes care of. (There is also a pretty gruesome lethal stabbing, although without blood.) Only the villains are one-dimensional villains. Susan Sarandon is marvelous as the young oyster-bar employee who wants to become a casino dealer, even if it means putting up with hits from the oily French guy who teaches the fine art of dealing in a school run by the casinos. He smokes with a cigarette holder and sounds like Charles Boyer, the swine. What a fine actress she is. Even here, dressed in threadbare clothes, her skirts around her ankles, wearing clumsy boots, her hair a mop of Scottish red, she fixes a viewer's interest when she's on the screen. She's as vulnerable under those oyster shells as Lancaster is when he discovers he can't protect her from the villains. And the two of them have a tender love scene together, and later a more raucous good time. In the end they go their separate ways -- Lancaster back to his destiny, and Sarandon in search of hers. The characters in the film bounce around at first, at odds with one another, or simply unaware of the others' presence, but Malle draws them together into a community whose welfare we finally come to care about.
