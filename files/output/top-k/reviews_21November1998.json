It has little in it you have not seen before.  There are a couple of brief moments which I found quite wonderful.  But not enough to strongly recommend the film. My favorite is when Hoskins who has a crush on a young woman, sees her hand print on a counter and presses his own hand print on top of it. That I liked a lot. Unfortunately his obvious infatuation of the young lady never leads anywhere (which may be the point of course), but it's so subtle and so unrealized it barely registers. But there is that moment.It takes a long time to get involved in the film.  It concerns some poor working class youths in a nowhere town in England. Everyone there seems pretty miserable.  Hoskins decides to revitalize the boxing club that kept him out of trouble when he was growing up and recruits several of the town's youths half of whom are quite reluctant.  When the rich father of an out of shape kid puts a little money behind the project, some additional interest in the club leads to some publicity and a match with another town's boxing club. This does not go off very well at all. That's it. There are a few well directed scenes showing the relationships of a lad to his bully father.  But because we don't care very much about any of the characters in the film the impact is dulled.I can't praise the direction too highly because there are sequences that play like working class mtv videos.

Kane Hodder was definitely the best Jason, up to a point. The direction is a bit lame in places but quite adequate in others. The premise of the movie is good but the acting and dialogue really sucks in some parts. If this movie was made today, no way would they get away with such dialogue. Actors nowadays just wouldn't speak it. I'm not a big fan of the Harry Manfredini music in the first 5 movies but here he introduces an, eerie, ghostly little theme that crops up every now and again. Jason is also at his coolest with the bones showing thru his boiler suit. New Line ditched this look with Jason Goes To Hell. In part 10, or Freddy vs Jason I really hope they don't make Jason the way he was in JGTH. That movie just seemed totally miscellaneous, it didn't fit with the others( and Jason had hair). Overall this is very watchable and pretty good, but why do the end credits roll like a TV movie?Regarding the DVD...it's not good. F13 Part VII The New Blood is my fave Friday the 13th movie thanks to the strong supernatural elements and a jazzed up score from Harry Manfredini and Fred Mollin. I looked forward to this DVD, I was let down tremendously.Director John Carl Buechler was horrified when the MPAA made him chop his film up worse than Jason ever could and censor almost every spot of blood. This changed the film from a strong and effective horror to a tedious assembly of teens getting killed.Horror films are supposed to offend and upset. In horror you have the capability to provoke a very wide variety of emotions from your audience. Even if the source material is rather weak, if pulled off correctly you can entertain them in such a way that they'll babble about the movie for weeks and perhaps never forget it.This is exactly what John Carl Buechler did with this movie. Sadly no audience was to be exposed to his make-up genius or copious gore. The movie was wasted. Or, in his own words, castrated. I couldn't agree more.Buechler approached Paramount with his own cut of the film, many deleted scenes and a wealth of extra material and proposed a special edition DVD.
