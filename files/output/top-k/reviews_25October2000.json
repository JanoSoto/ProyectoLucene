Not only that, but when my children were growing up, in a different place, our church was also St Joan of Arc. So you might say I have a long standing interest in the subject.Before I saw this one, I saw the other recent one, with Leelee Sobieski in the lead role.  Both are wonderful movies, and very different in their approach. I think Milla Jovovich's performance as Joan in this one is truly great. She is, at various times, an innocent peasant trying to follow God's call, and a half-crazed warrior bent of exterminating the British who won't leave her land.Luc Besson directed The Messenger in a more epic style, sometimes going overboard with battle scenes, and 50 ways to kill your enemy. But he also used grand music, great special effects, and one of the best uses of front and rear channel surround sound on the Dolby Digital 5.1 DVD version.  There also is a good dollop of low-frequency bass that tests your subwoofer, and rattles your picture frames.  Without a modern home-theater sound system, this would be a totally different and inferior movie experience.One of the extras on the DVD is a featurette, narrated primarily my Milla Jovovich, which delves into the making of this film.  They did extensive research in France, used some of the translations of the original trial transcript, and used 15th century drawings of events in her life to model the costumes and sets. The result is a very realistic portrayal of the historical events in those two years, 1429 through 1431, when Joan was 17 through 19, and lead the French army against the British to save France.The film makes clever use of a fictional character called the Conscience, played by Dustin Hoffman. He shows up when Joan is in prison awaiting trial. No one else can see him, he is obviously a vision, that she talks to, and expresses her doubts. Some have said this makes the film an atheistic view of Joan. I strongly disagree. To me it brings out more clearly her humanity, her natural doubts about what she really heard from God, and what she may have done on her own. Her asking for confession and forgiveness is a natural response for someone who was so strongly grounded in her Catholic faith.All-in-all, for someone wanting both an entertaining and significant movie experience, The Messenger delivers. It is a bit long, almost 3 hours, but it never gets slow or boring. In addition to Jovovich and Hoffman, John Malkovich is good as the Dauphin who becomes king of France, and Faye Dunnaway as his stepmother. I rate this movie a strong 8 of 10.

You're inclined to think Robert Zemeckis believes so, because, despite a few humorous moments firmly rooted in character, he offers an admirably solemn chiller aimed at tensing you to maddening point, preying on those fears you'd rather repress, those things that lie beneath.For about 100 minutes.  The first thing to be wary about in this movie - and this is the sort of movie where you need to be manically vigilant or you needn't bother - is the title.  It's too easy, almost mocking.  After all, the whole point of a horror movie is to reveal what lies beneath.  You may as well call a crime film 'Cops and Robbers' or a period effort 'Frills and Flounces'.By a canny Zemickian paradox, however, the opposite may be actually true. For this is a movie that wears its Hitchcockian subtext defiantly on its surface.  It plays with at least three different 'classic' horror-thriller staples.  At first you might think you're watching 'Rear Window', as Claire believes the mysteriously uncivil man next door has done away with his wife. As in Hitchcock's film, there is the ambiguous night scene, where the husband appears to be bundling off a corpse.  There is the voyeurism, culminating in a brilliant, hilarious, shocking shot, where Claire's prying eye is met by the eye she was spying on through the fence.  You figure Hitchcock would approve.  She spies on the husband with binoculars and he catches her doing it.  Her lover, in this case her husband, doesn't believe her.  L.B. Jeffries was a cameraman, photographs play a big part in this movie.  While her husband is out making all the money, she is alone and vulnerable.  Like the two couples in 'Rear Window', Claire finds uncomfortable affinities with the victim.But just when you're patting yourself on the back and asking how gender transforms the classic Hitchcockian set-up, the whole thing is revealed as a damp squib, and you have to begin again (although you do get an excellent joke when she meets the suspect and his victim at a party).The other two options are similarly 'traditional'.  There is the psychological deterioration model.  Zemeckis pushes this for all it is worth, making Claire a mother who has just lost her only child to college, who's recovering from an horrific car crash only a year ago, whose husband neglects her for his work, and most importanly, who has given up her music career to raise her daughter and support a family.  There's enough in there to frazzle the hardiest kook.  Add an isolated house with a dodgy front door, and is it any wonder she's having visions?This model brings horror close to its roots in melodrama, where the horrors become a displacement of the frustration and repressions of a woman limited in her life choices - the home serves as a metaphor for both her entrapment and her deteriorating mind.  The first image, over the credits, is seen as an hallucination of Claire's, and we are properly on our guard throughout. This breakdown is catered for by the whole gamut of classic Freudian paraphernalia - repeated scenes (the bath), submergence in water, keys, rings, bracelets, hair, doors, glass, mirrors, Oedipal problems etc, all leading us to suspect a sexually based trauma.  This is linked to the third model, the family secret, where a past horror is locked away, and is slowly eating away at the family and its individuals.  Relief will not come until it is expelled.As I say, for about 100 minutes Zemickis plays on all three models with surface seriousness and covert playfulness (which is what really lies beneath).  This is fine by me, the repertoire of haunted house cliches is generally amusing, especially when done with such intelligence, visual (all that white with its sparse splashes of red; the ghostly message on the mirror, 'You Know', cracking over Claire's fogged reflecton), formal (loved those scenes with the psychiatrist) beauty, and rich characterisation of the female lead.  This method achieves some excellent jerks, and an atmosphere almost as chilling in its potential as 'Final Destination'.But a state of tense suspension cannot be held indefinitely (in Hollywood anyway), and plot must out.  This shift can be accurately traced at the moment when Claire's point of view, which has, without interruption, dominated and filtered the film for 100 minutes.  For the film to achieve resoluton, it has to move from female time, which is repetitive, fluid, elliptical, enigmatic, open into male time, which is straight-ahead, no-nonsense, progresive, explanatory, closed.  This is a gross stereotype, but it's true here, and as Norman takes over, the film collapses into daft 'Fatal Attraction' territory.  Or it appears to, until you wonder whether Zemeckis's joke is finally paying off, as he asks how we could possibly have taken this seriously, with the 'Psycho' quotes in the film and on the soundtrack virtually giving it away.  The way Claire gets out of the death-bath and her final supernatural rescue are so ridiculous they have to be a joke.

This is fine by me, the repertoire of haunted house cliches is generally amusing, especially when done with such intelligence, visual (all that white with its sparse splashes of red; the ghostly message on the mirror, 'You Know', cracking over Claire's fogged reflecton), formal (loved those scenes with the psychiatrist) beauty, and rich characterisation of the female lead.  This method achieves some excellent jerks, and an atmosphere almost as chilling in its potential as 'Final Destination'.But a state of tense suspension cannot be held indefinitely (in Hollywood anyway), and plot must out.  This shift can be accurately traced at the moment when Claire's point of view, which has, without interruption, dominated and filtered the film for 100 minutes.  For the film to achieve resoluton, it has to move from female time, which is repetitive, fluid, elliptical, enigmatic, open into male time, which is straight-ahead, no-nonsense, progresive, explanatory, closed.  This is a gross stereotype, but it's true here, and as Norman takes over, the film collapses into daft 'Fatal Attraction' territory.  Or it appears to, until you wonder whether Zemeckis's joke is finally paying off, as he asks how we could possibly have taken this seriously, with the 'Psycho' quotes in the film and on the soundtrack virtually giving it away.  The way Claire gets out of the death-bath and her final supernatural rescue are so ridiculous they have to be a joke.  And so a subtle portrait of marriage and female loneliness becomes another post-modern joke.  Oh well.

It is at times directed very creatively and stylishly.  Some gun battles, early on, are photographed in a gutsy new way.  The camera movement can be very creative, and the cinematography is almost unjustly good for the type of movie it is(in my opinion, Oscar-worthy, or at least the director of photography is.)But the movie is a mess.  It starts off intriguingly, and I was interested in what would happen.  It lost me about half way through.  The casting in this movie is bad; I am not a fan of Ryan Phillippe, but to be fair I'll say that he did a decent job.  However, I couldn't buy him in this role--he is too young and boy-like for it, and I didn't understand his motivation.  This is also true of the doctor character, Benecio Del Toro, and particularly Nicky Katt and Taye Diggs.  They do fine with their roles, however, they are both too young for me to believe that they are hardened bodyguards who don't care about dyeing, just losing.  This casting gave the movie an almost student film like feel, as if we were watching a movie directed by someone in their twenties, who cast young actors and his friends in the leads.  Don't get me wrong, it's alright to cast these actors, but it would have been more believable to see them as novices.I have often disliked a movie because I found that there were no likeable characters.  TWOTG has this big problem, but it actually manages to take this flaw a step further--I had no idea who I was supposed to be rooting for!  One might say that the two leads would be the best bet, but it is not that simple.  Eventually, I wanted this movie, growing darker and more bloody by the minute, to just wrap things up.  Instead, it just kept throwing more and more plot-twists at us.  Once I was lost I didn't even want to bother getting caught-up.From what I've heard, people who did like this film often claim that they really liked the final shoot-out at the Spanish mission.  But it really didn't work for me.  The earlier gun fights were gutsy and unpredictable.  This climactic scene is also gutsy, and shot unconventionally.  However, the director's risks failed this time.  It is often shot from afar, without cutting or moving in, for example the wide shot of Ryan Phillippe blasting his shotgun from behind the fountain.  It was intended to give us a fresh, being there sort of feeling.  But looking at it from afar, (again, with young actors) and the architecture of the movie-set-like church gave me the impression that I was watching a stunt show at a theme park.I acknowledge that this is mostly a matter of taste, and know that fans of The Way of the Gun like it as a dark action film.

Some gun battles, early on, are photographed in a gutsy new way.  The camera movement can be very creative, and the cinematography is almost unjustly good for the type of movie it is(in my opinion, Oscar-worthy, or at least the director of photography is.)But the movie is a mess.  It starts off intriguingly, and I was interested in what would happen.  It lost me about half way through.  The casting in this movie is bad; I am not a fan of Ryan Phillippe, but to be fair I'll say that he did a decent job.  However, I couldn't buy him in this role--he is too young and boy-like for it, and I didn't understand his motivation.  This is also true of the doctor character, Benecio Del Toro, and particularly Nicky Katt and Taye Diggs.  They do fine with their roles, however, they are both too young for me to believe that they are hardened bodyguards who don't care about dyeing, just losing.

I know that in some way he will be slick and sleazy (e.g., Breathless (1983), Internal Affairs (1990), etc.) and I can get involved in his contrary nature. In other words, he won't bore me with a one-dimensional persona. Here however he is thoughtful, kind, considerate, intelligent--a non-sleazy, gray-suited business man with a wise and fatherly manner. Perhaps this is Gere's persona for his middle years...In the case of Julia Roberts, not only is she nice to look at, she is interesting to look at. It is no accident that her face is one of the silver screen's dominate images from the nineties. She has a powerfully expression nature and can assume a role as easily as one puts on a coat. She is striking physically, the huge mouth, the delicate nose, the long limbs... She is also the quintessence of a woman who can appear ordinary or beautiful according to circumstances. I have seen her in two PBS productions of Nature. (Yes, she is a Hollywood star with compassion, or at least one who loves animals.) In one she is in Borneo with orangutans, and in the other in Mongolia with the descendants of Genghis Khan and the wild horses. In both cases she throws herself into the dirt and discomfort like a trooper without a hint of the glamour she left thousands of miles behind. She charms both the children of the nomads and the orangutans. In fact, one randy orangutan becomes so smitten with her that he starts to put the moves on, and has to be restrained! In other words she has an equalitarian, democratic, down-to-earth nature which sits well with a popular audience. She has made so many movies lately (hurriedly as her youth is expiring she is now over thirty, the age of death for most Hollywood actresses) that I cannot keep up with them, so many that her ranking among the great stars of the screen is still up for grabs as we evaluate her many performances.Will her role in Pretty Woman help? Although I found it difficult to swallow her fake bad grammar, the phony lack of sophistication, and the predictability of her golden heart, I thought it marginally plausible that such a striking woman COULD in some strange parallel universe be reduced to hooking in Hollywood. And I thought she did a creditable job by bringing some originality to a well-worn role. Certainly I believed in Julia Roberts, the whore, as much as I did in Elisabeth Shue, the whore (from Leaving Las Vegas (1995)). Had Roberts been portrayed as a drug addict--which of course Hollywood made a stringent point of NOT doing, since they needed Middle America to identify with her in order to sell tickets--I might have bought it. Most American prostitutes are drug addicts. That's how most of them they got enslaved into the business in the first place.So what we have here is a variation on an old Hollywood fantasy poor, underclass girl, through her natural beauty, lovable nature and good common sense wins the heart of a man of considerable means, thus upgrading her social and economic status, etc. In others words, this is a woman's fantasy-fulfillment movie all the way. The real question to be asked, though, is how did the chemistry between the two stars work? Do Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn or Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan have anything to be jealous about? I think not, but judging from the box office success and the fact that they were paired again in Runaway Bride (1999), I am probably wrong. But see it and judge for yourself. Despite the cliché situation, this is more than a confectioner's diversion because of what it implies, and what we can learn, about the American psyche, circa 1990.(Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

As a result, we are treated to a wealth of emotion fear, sadness, joy, confusion, and humor, each one a compliment to the other.Haley Joel Osment delivers, plain and simple.  By now, so much has been said about the young actor that any more would be repetition.  Needless to say, his portrayal of Cole Sear is remarkable.  His ability to communicate, through a simple look or gesture, the depths to which his character's soul has been thrust is what truly carries the film.  He succeeds at this task beautifully, convincing us while never going over the top; indeed, by the time Cole utters his now-famous line, you not only believe him, you are chilled by the fact that Osment the actor may actually believe it himself.Bruce Willis turns in a stellar performance, complimenting his young co-star while never overshadowing him.  It is a tribute to his respect of the material in so much as he fine tunes his delivery to seem reserved, yet not too toned down.The Sixth Sense is more than simply a wondrous two hours.  It has, in effect, created a new genre of filmmaking... the film is neither drama, nor horror, nor action.  Rather, it is a seamless blending of all three, a film that encompasses the best aspects of each genre, without being limited by the worst.  Hollywood has taken notice of this, and one can only expect a series of poor imitations to follow.  But at least they'll always have The Sixth Sense to guide the way.

As a result, we are treated to a wealth of emotion fear, sadness, joy, confusion, and humor, each one a compliment to the other.Haley Joel Osment delivers, plain and simple.  By now, so much has been said about the young actor that any more would be repetition.  Needless to say, his portrayal of Cole Sear is remarkable.  His ability to communicate, through a simple look or gesture, the depths to which his character's soul has been thrust is what truly carries the film.  He succeeds at this task beautifully, convincing us while never going over the top; indeed, by the time Cole utters his now-famous line, you not only believe him, you are chilled by the fact that Osment the actor may actually believe it himself.Bruce Willis turns in a stellar performance, complimenting his young co-star while never overshadowing him.  It is a tribute to his respect of the material in so much as he fine tunes his delivery to seem reserved, yet not too toned down.The Sixth Sense is more than simply a wondrous two hours.  It has, in effect, created a new genre of filmmaking... the film is neither drama, nor horror, nor action.  Rather, it is a seamless blending of all three, a film that encompasses the best aspects of each genre, without being limited by the worst.  Hollywood has taken notice of this, and one can only expect a series of poor imitations to follow.  But at least they'll always have The Sixth Sense to guide the way.

While this may sound melodramatic, in reality it is not.  Why do we watch Die Hard over and over, so many years later, even though we know exactly what will happen?  Why do we get that familiar clenching of the gut everytime John McClane picks up a gun?  In essence, this is because, while it may not be new, it is nonetheless always exciting.This is not so much a review of Die Hard as it is a lavishing of praise. With that one movie, the filmmakers achieved what so many have struggled to do since  they made the quintessential action movie, and in doing so they changed the audience's level of acceptance as to what a great movie really is.  The attention to detail is remarkable, and evident in every scene. Bruce Willis and Alan Rickman are not so much acting as they are living their roles, so much so that it almost feels as if, years later, they are still locked into their battle, each testing the others' resolve.This film will forever remain as a testament to what can be accomplished by paying strict attention to detail.  Because of that dedication to the film, we as the audience are left with a finely crafted piece of work, where every scene resonates with an ambience that can only be described as a perfect fit, where no word or movement is given needlessly, and where we see a true hero act in a remarkable situation (and believe everything we see along the way).  I for one will continue to watch this film every time it pops up on cable, for in doing so I know, without a doubt, that I am in for a great ride.

The audiences? We're lemmings who follow the trends. The writers? Only thing they know about black culture come from racist portrayals, so how can they write decent material? The protestors? Many protestors in today's hip hop fueled social situation are as bad as the portrayals they protest. The acting is strong, especially Tommy Davidson and Jada Pinkett-Smith. Rapper Mos Def has a strong debut as the leader of a gangsta rap group called the Mau Maus. What sets this movie apart from other Spike Lee movies about race? He's maturing as a writer and filmmaker. He's less angry than you think, there's a sadness here that allows an emotional depth rarely seen in a Spike Lee joint. Also, like his masterpiece Do the Right Thing, Bamboozled asks questions and doesn't offer answers, which makes the story more thought provoking than any Lee film since Do the Right Thing.

In fact, Flash Gordon, Star Wars, and Battlestar Galactica began a lifelong obsession with science fiction and fantasy in all of its good (and especially) bad forms. The above summary isn't really accurate; 20 years don't make a difference to how much I like this film, but they have changed my reasons for liking it. With hindsight, I've discovered exactly who Lorenzo Semple Jr. is, and now, fully understanding the camp elements of this film, I can still enjoy it, but on a completely new level. As for complaints about the acting of Sam Jones (who did much worse in the abysmal firefighter series Code Red) and Melody Anderson, you hire actors for what they can do, not what they can't. This is why Keanu Reeves was perfect for The Matrix, and why Arnold Schwarzenegger was perfect for The Terminator. Jones and Anderson serve the same purpose for Semple as Adam West and Burt Ward did in the Batman series; who better than someone sadly lacking in acting skills to deliver a completely ludicrous line with a straight face? Unless your name is Charlton Heston, experienced actors have a difficult time with it. Anyways, I digress. The things that first attracted me to this film still do it for me, and that would be the production values and special effects, not to mention the great soundtrack by Queen (I actually had a friend consider using Brian May's arrangement of the Wedding March at his wedding; his mother, of course, ixnayed it). This is still a great looking movie, even by today's standards, which makes me wonder if DeLaurentiis was in on the joke the whole time. All in all, a lot of fun, unless you get offended by less than faithful revisions, in which case I have to wonder about your upbringing.
