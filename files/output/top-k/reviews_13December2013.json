[{"date":"13 December 2013","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Eduardo Sanchez & Daniel Myrick co-directed this surprisingly effective film that is presented as the realistic found footage of a documentary made by three college filmmakers Heather Donahue, Michael Williams, & Joshua Leonard(who play themselves) and how they set out to make a film about a local legend called the Blair Witch, who is rumored to haunt the woods in rural Maryland after being left to die by townspeople who feared she was a witch. The students, after done interviewing locals, go into the woods and see some strange things before getting lost, as they literally go in circles with no idea how or why. After hearing sinister sounds at night, one of them goes missing, as tensions flair and hopes are dashed... Surprise hit in 1999 is still an exceptionally well-done horror film, which uses imagination and suggestion to tell its story(except for the rampant profanity!). Creates a genuinely unsettling atmosphere of fear and dread, and the acting is good too, leading to a most stunning end.
