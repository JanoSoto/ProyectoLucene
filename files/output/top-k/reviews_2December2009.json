Absolutely not to discourage anyone from seeing this, but no one thought it was funny. Make that, they specifically stated they didn't get it. Of course not. Not one of the three groups actually worked in an office. At that time (1999,) I had only worked in a cubicle work environment for 3 years (sadly, to date, it's been now 13 years) and I already knew how true this movie was. And still is.Office Space is divided into three separate movies 1. a live-action Dilbert film, 2. A fantasy, one that most of us office drones dream of, and 3. real life, for the most part.Personally, I loved the whole movie, but it does lose steam after awhile. The fantasy part, or mid-section, is a little over the top. Yeah, I get the main character, Peter, doesn't care due to an unfortunate blessing in the first part, but what he does (i.e. pulling down a banner in front of everyone) to show his distaste for the place would be pretty much an immediate termination in the real office world. Then, again, that's why that's the fantasy part.The movie begins with Peter on his way to work, stuck in traffic and you immediately know he's unhappy in life. Peter arrives at work, a software company, and things continue to go downhill. In fact, things never pick up until his possible-cheating girlfriend convinces him to go to a hypnotherapist who promptly gets Peter to forget his worries, enjoy life all the while having a heart attack. Peter is so relaxed, it doesn't faze him that a man dies right in front of him.Peter's attitude positively changes as downsizing begins in his firm and due to his (finally) real honesty, he gets promoted (this, of course, falls under the fantasy segments) and his closest hard-working buddies get canned. To get back at the company, Peter organizes a (literal) Superman III plot of stealing half-cents, which of course turns for the worse. (As a life-long Superman fan, and Part III ranks as an absolute guilty pleasure of mine, I always enjoy that segment.) Oh, and all the while we have Milton (the character, like Dilbert, was reason the movie was made) who always threatens to burn down the building and waitress Joanna (Aniston &#x96; who, again, can never rid herself of Rachel from Friends) who is the object of Peter's obsession.There is a lot more, but let me tell you this this movie is so incredibly true with its characters from an office, the real-life situations (man, did they have a camera in my offices I've worked for?) and the politics that follow. Currently, I now have seen this movie probably two dozen times and laugh out loud while shaking head each time.Sadly, not only do I know many of the workers in this movie in real life, I resemble a lot of them myself. Peter, mainly, but I do, unfortunately, share qualities of a few others. One I don't, however, is the love for rap music. That, and the movie wandering a bit in the mid-section, is my only distaste for the movie. There's more music that could have been entered into this movie, but they chose rap for the entire movie.That said, everyone (but, of course, Rachel once again) did a great job, especially Cole (as the boss) and Livingston (as Peter.) I already thought Cole did an excellent job as Mr. Brady in the Brady Bunch movies, but here he does even better as 90% of bosses I've worked for. As for Livingston, he did such an incredible job at the character he was portraying, it was almost depressing on how much I see myself in him and his speeches. Unfortunately, I can't live in the fantasy world he visits (in the middle to end of the movie) because, this is, of course, real life and I do need my job.As for the quotes! Every job I've worked for, every department I've been moved to, every employee\/friend I've encountered knows these quotes, any quotes, by heart. I could say Hello, **enter in any name**, what's happening? TPS reports, PC load letter? O-face, Case of the Mondays, Did you get the memo? Is This Good for the Company? or I have a meeting with the 'Bobs' and every single person I encounter will know exactly what I am talking about and laugh. Even my bosses. The only other movie, comedy or not, that I can say that about is Airplane! and even then, not everyone know those quotes, Shirley, but they know Office Space's.This movie ranks very high on my favorite comedies of all time. I honestly don't think you need to work in a cube, but I guess it helps. Tell me how many times a boss hasn't come up to you and said what they said to either Peter or Joanna? It's funny in the movie, but so incredibly sad that it happens in real life. I mean, is there a book managers\/supervisors read or forced to read that tell them to say some of this crap? (Side Note I understand this is fiction and a spoof, but if you were to rob your business on the day you're scheduled to be fired by planting a virus to shift fractions of a cent into a credit union account, would you seriously check the bank balance at an ATM? Sorry, I just thought that was funny. Nice job on the sunglasses, though, Peter.)

Three, is a mix of the above, and it's the way I think a lot of people have started to watch this movie, at least that is the case for me.When I first saw this movie in the theatre, I loved the movie for really simple reasons(not bad, but simple) it was visually stunning for it's time, it had funny, over the top characters that you just can't help but to love, and a cast of really easy on the eye actors.Then I bought the DVD, and started to notice all the social commentary that I kinda missed the first time around, and now I hold this film as one of my all-time favorites, maybe even top 5.I see a lot of difference in opinion on these boards, and I can't help but to think that the people that do not like this movie, have not moved away from the first example I wrote on how to watch this film, and simply do not like sci-fi films, and don't want to give credibility to the genre.For people who DO like sci-fi, and are open to new takes on the sci-fi genre, this movie is a godsend. It's a treat for the eyes, ears, and brain, and just one of the most entertaining movies I've ever had the privilege to see. If you haven't seen it, I envy you, cause you're in for a real treat.If I had rated this movie back when it came out, I would have given it a seven, maybe an eight, but now, after so many years, and views, I have come to the conclusion that this movie deserves a top score, ten out of ten from Sweden.

I think Kubrick was well versed with what he was planning to do at the time of making this movie. There is hardly any place where I can point out flaws. For those who have not yet seen (which I doubt&#x85;..) this movie takes us to the time of on going Vietnam War. We are introduced to a company of rookies who joins the boot camp (USMC) Parris Island, South Carolina. Soon we are introduced to the unforgettable drill instructor Gunnery Sergeant Hartman brilliantly performed by Ronald Lee Ermey. First half of the movie deals with the dehumanizing process. On the way we are introduced to some the central characters. To me the most memorable character will be Pvt. Pyle. I think Vincent D'Onofrio had immortalized this character just like Heath had done for Joker in 'The Dark Knight'. Matthew Modine as Pvt. Joker was also very impressive.Second half of the movie deals with the experience of these characters' Tet Offensive during 1968. We are not given a clear cut ending to this movie and I guess Kubrick left that part to the viewer's imagination.This movie definitely falls under the category, which never ages. As far as I know this was the only War movie Stanley had ever directed. In my opinion, if some more action was included in the second half it would have been fine just like 'Platoon' still I would not complain, its still a great Movie. We do get some taste of some of the Classic Rock Songs which includes two of my favorites Johnny Wright's Hello Vietnam & Rolling Stones' Paint It, Black.Closing note will be, if any one is really interested to watch a movie with intense acting along with rich narrative script then FMJ delivers as it promises, without any degree of doubt. This is certainly thought provoking movie and should be with every collector. I think I am the lucky few who owns the Deluxe Edition (Widescreen) of Full Metal Jacket DVD which I got from Amazon UK.

","genre":"Drama, War"},{"date":"2 December 2009","score":"","review":" The movie Twelve Angry Man revolves around twelve jurors deciding the fate of the young boy who is accused of murdering his own father with a switchblade. In the beginning of the movie, we see the accused boy for a brief time and the judge telling the twelve jurors to make their decision. After the twelve jurors enter the jury room, they decide to take a preliminary vote to see who's where. During the preliminary vote, jurors # 1, 3, 4, 7, 10, and 12 immediately puts their hands up while jurors # 2, 5, 6, 9, and 11puts their hand up due to peer pressure. Juror #8 is the only one who voted not guilty. After the preliminary vote, juror # 12 suggests to convince juror #8 by going around the table telling the reason for their vote. Juror # 2 says he voted guilty because he just think he's guilty, while Juror # 3 says he has no personal feelings but the fact all says that the boy is guilty. Juror # 4 says boy's alibi was flimsy and couldn't even remember to movie he saw. Juror #5 asks for pass while Juror #6 says that the people's testimony was strong. Juror #7 believes his guilty because of his past criminal life. Lastly, Juror # 10 also believes in the testimony of an old woman who said she saw the killing. The other jurors did not tell us the reason for their voting. Although some of the reasons are logical and reasonable, the other reasons are not logical such as juror # 2 where he says he just thinks he's guilty and juror # 4 where he just believes his guilty because of weak alibi. Throughout the movie, there were many evidences pointed out by many of the jurors. Some of the things that motivated their consciences are their own experience with their sons and their prejudice. There were a few main pieces of evidence against the accused. First one was the switchblade used to kill the father where it is believed that the switchblade is one of its kind and store manager identified it, however, it is revealed that it could be easily bought for $6 at other stores. Second Evidence was the testimony of old man who lived down stairs. He said that he heard the killing and saw the boy run away after killing the father. Last main evidence was the testimony of an old woman. She said that she was trying to sleep when she saw the boy stabbing his father through the windows of the train passing by. The two antagonists of the movie are juror # 3 and 8. They were forced to pit their wills against each other because while juror # 3 believed the boy to be guilty, the juror # 8 continuously said the boy is not guilty. In the end juror # 8 won as the juror # 3 changed his vote to not guilty. The juror # 8 won because he firmly followed his conscience while juror # 3 let the emotion get better of him saying I'm gonna kill you and we can throw away all the other evidences. By the end of the movie, the jurors started to realize that the evidences have faults in them. Throughout the debate, jurors gain many new insights to the evidences. The first evidence, unique switchblade is discovered to be not unique at all and can be bought for $6. The two testimonies by 2 people also is discovered to be unlikely. It is almost impossible for an old man who has a bad leg to walk across the long hallway just in time to see the boy run away. It is also highly unlikely that the old woman without glasses can see the murder happening clearly through the windows of the moving train. The hearing of the body falling down and words said by the boy can also be false as there was a very loud train passing by them at that time. Lastly, the phrase I'm gonna kill you are said everyday without actually meaning to kill someone. As the discussion went on, many jurors started to get more insight to the case and started to change their vote to not guilty. Two of the jurors who changed their votes are juror # 9 and juror # 7. Juror # 9 says he changed his vote because he respected the juror # 8 standing alone and trying to help the boy out. This swayed the juror # 9 to wanting to hear more and discuss about it more deeply. Juror # 7 however, changes his vote just because he is sick of all the talking while he really just wants to go to the ball game before it ends. I believe that the juror who had the most mature conscience is juror # 8. Despite being pressured by the 11 other jurors, he believed that you can't send a boy to the chair just with 5 minutes of discussion and voted not guilty following his principles of human life. He did his best to convince the others that the boy may not be guilty and succeeded in the end. The juror with the least conscience is the juror # 7. He was very impatient during the whole discussion and frequently joked about the case and the life of the boy like it was nothing important. He even changed his vote only because he wanted to go to the ball game before it started. He was acting only for his benefits and following the ego level of the conscience. The movie Twelve Angry Men explores wide range of conscience levels and the discussion involving human life. Throughout the movie, there were many changes occurring between how jurors saw the case and what they believed. I really enjoyed the movie and how the jurors changed as the many of the evidences started to prove inaccurate.

I kept on waiting for the good parts until the end of the movie.Let me also tell you that for any movie reading a book should not be a pre-requisite....if there is , then that is a flaw with the movie.The movie deals with a psychotic character Patrick Baleman who hides his psychotic part from his co-workers and friends(?)....In reality Bateman has no friends, everyone is superficial...As the movie progresses Bateman's veil of sanity slowly falls off....When you watch the movie, you are unable to interpret what is real and what is imaginary....The film depicts how these could co-exist.....It depicts the movie from the view-point of a psychotic So why did i find it boring???? 1)Because there were no clear explanation of why Bateman became a psychotic....it is not necessary that a movie explains this...but I find it interesting only if that is explained...Then the movie can be enjoyed ....You find fun to see a mind unravel...FightClub is a good example...Apart from the fact that FightClub deals with a more visually interesting psychiatry case viz MPD....there is a proper logical explanation of the main character became a psychotic....not the case with American Psycho....Add to this the fact the condition he suffers from is not a very visually stimulating one and that it is in fact depicted in a boring fashion, makes it a forgettable movie experience.Let me give you an analogy....People enjoy playing chess, its fun to use our mind designing strategies...Its even fun to watch a game of chess....You find it fun to watch the moves, how one player uses a strategy and how the other counters it....But can u enjoy a game of chess if you don't understand whats going on -if the game goes above you head(like if two top level players are playing)....Now imagine a situation where two fools are playing it...Again u can't find it interesting to watch their game....u don't get it, because there is nothing to get!!!!

I grew up with them, my first model of what action meant was deriving between the hard heroes films (siegel, stallone, van damme, schwarzenegger) and the fantasy adventures of the Spielberg streak (which includes Zemeckis). Rewatching them, i sometimes have to redefine what action means. Mostly because in many of them, we have a couple of actual physical action, and a huge dose of funny dialogues. So, in the 80's, action and comedy are a suitable mix. Not so much here, of course, but this is still a sub product of the influences audiences were still accepting in those days..following the above, it is fundamental to notice how everything is bent to the vision of Ridley Scott. The man is great and envisioning things, at the largest scale the film allows, taking care of the bigger arc that every film should have. Even today, no one working now does this better than him. Here i think he tried to embed the film in a Blade Runner driven decadence. Of course it's another context, and definitely another script! But watch how every shot is carefully frame, not to be worth (only) on its own as, say, Bertolucci might do. Every sequence is chained to all the others. That's the big form.

In the film, an American family comprised of two young daughters and their folks rents out an impressive mansion in the British countryside, and the two girls soon realize that some strange presence is attempting to make contact with them. Could it be the ghost of Karen Aylwood, who had vanished from the mansion almost 30 years before? An interesting setup, but the film, great as it may be to look at, is, sadly, a mixed bag at best. Lynn-Holly Johnson, who I'd only seen previously as a bratty Olympic hopeful in the 1981 Bond outing For Your Eyes Only, is quite good in the lead as the older, detectivelike daughter, almost coming off like a Hayley Mills for a new generation. Playing her parents, the great Carroll Baker and former U.N.C.L.E. agent David McCallum are given too little to do in smaller roles, while the most formidable actress of Hollywood's Golden Age, Bette Davis, playing Mrs. Aylwood, the mysterious owner of the imposing pile, fails somehow to convince as a British matron. Perhaps worst of all, the film's ending is a rushed and incoherent mess that never adequately explains away all the assorted mishegas that had come before. (The picture's two previously filmed--and scrapped--endings, included as extras on this DVD, show that the usually dependable screenwriter Brian Clemens had no small run of difficulties in wrapping this story up!) Still, the picture somehow manages to please, mainly due to Johnson's sweet portrayal and some fabulous cinematography. (How great this film must have looked on the big screen!) And with that Disney imprimatur, need I even mention that this is one horror flick eminently suitable for watching with the kiddies? Indeed, they'll probably wind up liking it even more than Mom and Pops!

Here's why.They should have re-titled this Ken & Barbie Go To Military Court. Cruise and Moore are completely unbelievable as their characters. They're both too young and good-looking to play navy lawyers. The roles cried out for more mature, hard-edged actors. Don't get me wrong, I have enjoyed both Moore and Cruise in other roles, but I think they're the wrong choices here.The script never misses an opportunity to be obvious. The animosity between the two leads which turns to admiration. The overly sincere speeches about duty and bucking the odds. Then there's the climatic courtroom showdown between Cruise and Nicholson, which is so ridiculous I have to address with specifics*****************SPOILERS*************************** After his key witness kills himself, Cruise risks a court marshal by sending a subpoena to the evil Colonel Jessup (Nicholson). His strategy he hopes to goad him on the witness stand into admitting he directly ordered the code red that caused Santiago's death. He thinks he can bully a hardened Marine Colonel. Forget evidence, he'll just admit the crime when he gets angry. All courtroom procedures are cast aside. Nicholson gets up in the middle of his testimony to leave. Uh, that's not allowed in court. But it does give the two macho guys a chance to yell at each other. Then the judge lets Nicholson give a long speech about how he defends the US. Aren't witnesses just supposed to answer questions? Well, not when it adds to the drama, or should I say melodrama. It's all so ridiculously over-the-top. The most cringe-inducing moment is when Nicholson finally admits he gave the order, You're Damn Right I Did! Nicholson the actor is too smart to be believed as a character so stupid. I rolled my eyes so much in this final scene that I think I sustained retinal damage.Obvious, embarrassing, hackneyed, maudlin - I run out of adjectives to describe how silly this movie is. It's amazing what people will swallow when it's fed to them by big name stars.

Daniel Hilliard (Robin Williams) and Miranda Hilliard (Sally Field) get a divorce after many years of marriage and three great children. Daniel wants to stay together and work it out, to be with his kids, but Miranda disagrees. During the divorce, Daniel can only see his children once a week and that is not enough for him. Daniel decides to take matters into his own hands, with his unique characteristics as an actor in the film he disguises himself as British nanny named Mrs. Doubtfire to watch over the children while Miranda works so he can spend time with his children. Over time he spends more time with his children and helps them cope with the divorce and also betters himself along the way.I believe Mrs. Doubtfire is one of the best family films of its time and still today. It has a great story line and many emotional parts in the film that can bring families together. I have seen this film numerous times from when I was a young kid to an adult and every time it is still funny and heartwarming to me. I believe everyone should see this film and enjoy Robin Williams at his best as a British nanny.Mrs. Doubtfire was directed by Chris Columbus. I feel that Columbus does an excellent job directing the film. The unique story is portrayed as if the audience was right in film living the story. The audience can sense the emotion and closeness of the actors in the film and how great a job each scene is. I believe Columbus was trying to tell viewers that even when parents get divorced the children are always loved so much by both and will do anything to be with them. The director really portrays the feelings and emotions of families during hard times. This film is definitely one of my favorite films of all time and I love watching it with my family.
