Natasha Wagner and Rebecca Gayheart were excellent characters that needed to be developed more. Jared Leto did a wonderful job and his acting ability really shone through.All in all Urban Legend is an excellent date movie, or a chance just to hang out with friends, but if you are looking for a fresh new addition to the slasher genre, I suggest that you look somewhere else.As for the people who are comparing this film to the Scream series, I must say that I see where you are coming from, but remember that Scream isn't as original as it seems either.

The characters are unforgettable and the story, with its haunting surreal quality, will linger long in my mind.I read the book and found it difficult to read. Translated to film, however, the story works, and I found myself intrigued and interested in the tale set in 1873 of former slaves, making a new life for themselves and still living with the horror of the past.Hooray for Danny Glover.  He is outstanding in the part of Paul D, the former slave who comes courting Sethe, played by Oprah Winfrey, who is living with the effects of one horrible act of desperation. Oprah brings her presence to the film and is a good actress.  Alas, though, perhaps it is because she is so very very well-known, she was always more Oprah  to me than the character she was playing.The transitions and flashbacks within the film are seamless, so much so that I didn't realize until the list of credits rolled, that the part of Sethe as a younger woman was played by a different actress, Lisa Gay Hamilton.  She is in the scenes that give the movie its dramatic punch and drive the story and her acting is outstanding.  If Oprah gets nominated for an academy award I certainly hope that Lisa Gay Hamilton is not forgotten.At almost three hours the movie is too long.  Some of the middle could have been honed down.  Sethe's daughter, Denver, played by Kimberly Elise and the strange young woman visitor named Beloved, played by Thandie Newton, have many scenes together.  The audience guesses, long before the characters do, as to exactly who Beloved is, and there are much too many scenes illustrating the same points.  While played beautifully by the  two young actresses, a few less examples would have served the movie better.Beloved is the story of some troubled people told against a historical background that has never been really done well in a film before.  Its a somber story, with not a bit of comic relief to relieve the tension that keeps mounting.  It is also a classic tale of sin and punishment and, finally, a sort of redemption.  Recommended.  But be forewarned that you will not come out of the theater smiling.

He is outstanding in the part of Paul D, the former slave who comes courting Sethe, played by Oprah Winfrey, who is living with the effects of one horrible act of desperation. Oprah brings her presence to the film and is a good actress.  Alas, though, perhaps it is because she is so very very well-known, she was always more Oprah  to me than the character she was playing.The transitions and flashbacks within the film are seamless, so much so that I didn't realize until the list of credits rolled, that the part of Sethe as a younger woman was played by a different actress, Lisa Gay Hamilton.  She is in the scenes that give the movie its dramatic punch and drive the story and her acting is outstanding.  If Oprah gets nominated for an academy award I certainly hope that Lisa Gay Hamilton is not forgotten.At almost three hours the movie is too long.  Some of the middle could have been honed down.  Sethe's daughter, Denver, played by Kimberly Elise and the strange young woman visitor named Beloved, played by Thandie Newton, have many scenes together.  The audience guesses, long before the characters do, as to exactly who Beloved is, and there are much too many scenes illustrating the same points.  While played beautifully by the  two young actresses, a few less examples would have served the movie better.Beloved is the story of some troubled people told against a historical background that has never been really done well in a film before.  Its a somber story, with not a bit of comic relief to relieve the tension that keeps mounting.  It is also a classic tale of sin and punishment and, finally, a sort of redemption.  Recommended.  But be forewarned that you will not come out of the theater smiling.

But, while this was very different from the novel, I was pleasantly surprised. 'Practical Magic' is not your average romantic comedy or your average witch movie. Instead, it mixes the 2 genres together and creates a sparkling film that never gets boring. Even though some scenes are a little far-fetched, the acting, relationships and storyline keep it from getting too weird.As for the cast, I don't think it gets much better. Sandra Bullock pretty much plays her usual character, but she plays it with a well-acted sensitivity and you definitely sypathize for her. Nicole Kidman, is brilliant--very wild-child, but not so trampy that you hate her--and probably the most interesting character ( and the best performance) in the whole movie. Dianne Weist and Stockard Channing are extremely well cast as the eccentric aunts, and their on-screen presence is breathtaking. Aidan Quinn is also very good, playing Sandra Bullock's 'perfect man'. So what's my final outlook on 'Practical Magic'? Excellent. Sure, it's not a flawless, Oscar-worthy, masterpiece, but it's fun and one of the most interesting films I have seen in a long time.
