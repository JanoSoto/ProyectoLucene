Which brings to the other inexplicable aspect of it. I have no idea whatsoever why this movie left such an impression on me when I saw it in theaters. I've rewatched it on TV and video, and it had none of the impact it had when I saw it on the big screen (twice, or maybe three times, actually). But that might be it, the appeal of it. It's a Movie, yes, capital M there, it's an Epic, it's a spectacle in the order of Gone With the Wind or Ben Hur. Now, Ben Hur and Gone With the Wind seem kinda hokey to me, with the hammy acting and excessive melodrama. Not that Titanic has none of that. Well, the acting was actually very good. The melodrama was quite heavy-handed at times.But the reason Titanic works is that it's such an emotional ride. I usually enjoy movies that stimulate the mind, or give me a visual thrill. This movie isn't exactly dumb, but it's not cerebral at all. The visual thrills are simply means to an end, to fuel the emotions of the audience. I didn't cry when Bambi's mom died, I don't react to tearjerkers.

Night Shyamalan has respected the canons of really great horror-movie production, but with a limitation that to me is a flaw.Mel Gibson plays (Father) Graham Hess, an ex-clergyman from an unnamed Christian denomination, or probably an ex-Catholic priest in an alternate world where priests can get married.  He is a widower, and it is shown in flashbacks that he lost his faith when his wife was hit by a truck in a ghastly collision where she was pinned to a tree, nearly severed in half but still conscious enough for Hess to drive over and witness her choke out a few last, cryptic words.Hess lives on a farm in rural Pennsylvania with his brother and two small children when a crop-circle is cut into his cornfield.  Mysterious happenings trickle into the movie from that point, as Hess (and the audience) struggle to find meaningful explanations to what they are experiencing...Here there is no doubt that Shyamalan conducts expert pacing of the story to build tension, but this is not a grand epic of skies filled with UFOs like War of the Worlds.  This war is all told from the perspective of one man and his farm, as they barricade themselves at one point similar to one of the LIVING DEAD horror-movies.  We get flashes of the mysterious but large-scale invasion echoed in the news reports on the family TV, but like most TV news it seems unreal, uncertain, hard to believe from where they are.  So far this movie would not rise above any other low-budget horror movie that is not epic in scale, but Shyamalan brings in an excellent plot hook where the quirks or disabilities of the family-members become significant, and turn into gifts with which to nullify the alien threat in the final show-down.But the big flaw is that this movie is one, long commercial in favour of religion and belief.  At one point Hess, although supposedly Atheist, is talking to God in moments of stress, and when he forbids his daughter praying at the kitchen table, she actually cries (although most children would jump for joy at the prospect of more self-determination).  The unspoken question, Why would a loving God make my children this way? become answered as they help fight the aliens, although this could be turned around to ask why a perfect God would make aliens with a classic, deus ex machina, War of the Worlds-type flaw.  A belief is reinforced that God helps some of his creations more than others, and this belief has killed more billions of people in war than anything else.  At the very end of the film, we see Hess donning his clerical collar once again, at which point I decided to boo the screen.This is an outrageous sub-plot.  Now, Atheists are still not free in the U.S., where George Bush said Atheists could not be good American citizens.  However, in Canada they outnumber regular worshipers (27% to 21%) but must still endure constitutional mentions of God.  Ironically Atheists had more freedom in the Soviet Union, where spreading Atheist and anti-religious propaganda was protected by the Constitution.  I will say only that Atheists should not be misrepresented as lost sheep who hypocritically turn to God in times of trouble, and that if people want to learn about Atheists the way they really live, and maybe get some exit counseling from religion, they don't have to look far on the Internet.

A group of people buy it from the market at next to nothing, with no electricity which makes for some atmospheric lighting - at least they got this right.

So chilling&#133;As is traditional in an Amityville film a psychic just happens to be among the group to make the rest of the cast paranoid.

(Neil Simon movie music + squirt-in-the-eye blood squibs--ca ne marche pas.) And in POSSESSION, LaBute takes A.S. Byatt's upper-middlebrow English-major romance--in which two contemporary scholars track down a forbidden love between a famous nineteenth-century poet and a famous, married feminist-- and dunks it in the gamy, stale-shirt odor of his Dirty Rotten Truth.Roland, the male of the contemporary duo, is played by Aaron Eckhart, who describes himself, with consummate, dated LaButean inanity, as kind of a brush-n-flush kind a guy, and generally behaves around his opposite number, an icy British academician (Gwyneth Paltrow) like a community-college tight end bumping into Susan Sontag's bookshelves. Paltrow is hemmed in for sure by LaBute's airtight conception. She spends the entire movie with her hair in an anal-repressive bun so tight that it is eventually commented on. (Gwyneth's sexual liberation is a Seventies Clairol Moment.) But when she has something meaty to play--a confession of her helpless uptightness, a reach toward another that quickly shrivels into shame and hate--we are reminded that, yes, Gwyneth Paltrow is the strongest woman actor of her generation. (I will defend that against all comers.) And we are reminded that Aaron Eckhart has acted in all of Neil LaBute's movies--and Eckhart, having been LaBute's steadfast supporter way back in their persecuted days at Brigham Young, is now getting payday from a buddy. He gets the Billy Crudup part! I never thought I'd appreciate how good Crudup really is till now.Eckhart, so fuzzily likable in ERIN BROCKOVICH, doesn't seem to have a lot of resources.

If LaBute hadn't wrecked it already.Like the little fattie in THE PICKWICK PAPERS who says, I wants to make your flesh crawl, LaBute is never happier than when sticking poo-poo in the punch bowl. During some expository scenes in Eckhart's boss' office in a university, LaBute sets up an attraction between Eckhart and the boss' secretary--a cute, shy young thing who never gets up from her desk. Later, when Eckhart's evil rival tells the boss about Eckhart's misadventures with Paltrow, the rival makes sure the secretary can hear--so we can see her sad, crestfallen face when she realizes that Eckhart has found another love.

But when she has something meaty to play--a confession of her helpless uptightness, a reach toward another that quickly shrivels into shame and hate--we are reminded that, yes, Gwyneth Paltrow is the strongest woman actor of her generation. (I will defend that against all comers.) And we are reminded that Aaron Eckhart has acted in all of Neil LaBute's movies--and Eckhart, having been LaBute's steadfast supporter way back in their persecuted days at Brigham Young, is now getting payday from a buddy. He gets the Billy Crudup part! I never thought I'd appreciate how good Crudup really is till now.Eckhart, so fuzzily likable in ERIN BROCKOVICH, doesn't seem to have a lot of resources. His pudgy fuddy-dud in FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS was also a standout, probably because the character's acid-reflux introversion felt like a big reach for him. But when he's supposed to be Mr. Bedhead and Shiny Teeth, he looks like a soap star who got off on the wrong floor. He'd wreck the movie. If LaBute hadn't wrecked it already.Like the little fattie in THE PICKWICK PAPERS who says, I wants to make your flesh crawl, LaBute is never happier than when sticking poo-poo in the punch bowl. During some expository scenes in Eckhart's boss' office in a university, LaBute sets up an attraction between Eckhart and the boss' secretary--a cute, shy young thing who never gets up from her desk. Later, when Eckhart's evil rival tells the boss about Eckhart's misadventures with Paltrow, the rival makes sure the secretary can hear--so we can see her sad, crestfallen face when she realizes that Eckhart has found another love. Why? Does this contribute anything to the story or the thematics of the picture--except LaBute's endlessly reiterated non-idea, which he finally has Paltrow speak outright in this movie What's the point of connection when all men and women seem to do is rip each other apart? CARNAL KNOWLEDGE, one of the Rosetta stones of LaBute's dyspeptic canon, was not just throwing up its hands over the status of men and women--it suggested very tangible responsibilities, particularly on the part of the endlessly, cozily self-deceptive guys. In LaBute's world, we're meant to grin at the awfulness of it all--and then sigh, Well, what can you do! It's been like that since the world began. One suspects that LaBute considers this to be the sexualized version of Stanley Kubrick's civilization-as-murder worldview. The difference is that Kubrick made his points carefully, un-obviously, and with a good deal of regret. LaBute is a wallower. A friend put it best In a Todd Solondz movie, it's clear that Solondz wishes what happened were not so; in a LaBute movie, he clearly does wish it were so, and is glad that it is.Aside from the unnecessary carcinogens LaBute brings to the otherwise compelling dual structure of Byatt's novel, the director really has nothing much to offer. His skill with staging and the camera are no better than a middling television hack's. He is a huckster who clicked in--and we can only hope that his latest taboo-busting theatre works about 9-11 may keep him from darkening the doors of our cinemas any time soon.

It takes an incredible ability to convey all of this, but Mary does it and I am left to wonder why she did not assume more dramatic roles.  Perhaps it was too draining in that this part reflected so much of her own personal tragedies.
