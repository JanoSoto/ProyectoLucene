I tried to forget about it immediately, but twenty-two years later, I found a used DVD of it at a thrift store (cost fifty cents) and attempted to try a second time to understand why so many people thought this was the best Dracula ever!!! (see dozens of rapturous ten star reviews here on IMDb) In truth, this movie is still atrocious.So. It has been thoroughly established that the title is erroneous. Oh, there's about 25% of Bram Stoker in this pile of vampire guano, but the rest is Coppola's psychedelic interpretation. Coppola seemed determined to make a mom-porn sexy version of the famous novel, so much so that it's a mystery why he didn't cast Fabio in the title role instead of the scenery-chewing Gary Oldman. The screenwriter must have moonlighted for Harlequin Romance novels. For the reported forty million dollars the film cost to make, it looks cheap and shoddy. Painfully obvious models are used for the Westenra estate, the Carfax Abbey sets look borrowed from TV's Dark Shadows, and let's try to forget again about the model train chugging into Transylvania. The entire exercise feels claustrophobic. Oh yeah, the not so special effects need a mention here as well. Coppola's smug telling of the story includes the blue flames, seen here as coruscating rings of fire that look like superimposed images from the top of someone's gas range. No explanation for this is given, but in the novel, the coachman (who is Dracula) stops the coach to follow the flames, telling Harker that the blue fire indicates buried treasure. Coppola probably sat back, lit a cigar and felt really literary about including this small bit from the novel, while completely screwing up pretty much everything else. The much-touted makeup and costumes are so over-the-top and ridiculous it's amazing the actors wore them without laughing. Of special note is the whatever the hell dress Sadie Frost has to wear, the white lace thing with an Elizabethan neck ruff that needs it's own zip code. Miss Frost looks like her head has been detached and placed on a really large doily. Dracula's muscle-system striated armor is plastic, and it shows. Kudos to whoever convinced Coppola that Dracula wandered around his castle in a hostess gown and wore his hair in double-hump albino beehives. The Prince of Darkness is now the Queen of Transylvania. Even Liberace would have had trouble managing this look. You're in trouble when the most remembered thing about your movie is a very bad wig. Etc.The actors are pretty much embarrassing, only a few escape unscathed. Oldman overplays, Ryder has the appeal of wet cheesecloth, Frost seems to think she's in a soft-core cable porn epic, Waits should have turned this down, Sir Anthony must have need the check, and then there's like, whoa!, Keanu. Wonder if he took this off his resume, if not, he should.In review, this trashy version of one of the world's great Gothic tales is worse than you remember. It's not faithful enough to the source material, it's not campy enough to be a cult movie, and it's full of shoplifted touches from other, better vampire films. One of these larcenous bits is Dracula's independently moving shadow. While this does not appear in the novel, it was used first in Murnau's 1922 Nosferatu, especially the long distance shadow that attends Lucy's party. In 1932, Carl Dreyer used the independent shadow in his Vampyr to portray the power the vampire had over it's victims.I don't think I'll be watching this in 2036, because I gave the DVD back to the thrift store with some old clothes.

Basically Josh Hutton (Robert Burke) has been released from prison, having served time for murder, and he returns to his home town in Long Island, where no-one is sure about the details of his crime, whether the rumours are exaggerated, but they are certainly wary of him. Audry Hugo (Waitress actress and director Adrienne Shelly) lives in the town and already has a boyfriend in high school, but she soon meets Josh, dumps her boyfriend, and starts seeing him as her new mystery man, ignoring the tale tales of his manslaughter, he also finds himself a job as a mechanic working for Audry's father Vic (Chris Cooke). The relationship between them is anything but normal, not just because of Josh's crime being the talk of the town, but because Audry is a successful and sought after fashion model, and also she has high paranoia about big issues, such as the nuclear war and a forthcoming apocalypse, and in the end it is her modelling and travelling to New York that will ultimately break them up. Also starring Julia McNeal as Pearl, Katherine Mayfield as Liz Hugo, Gary Sauer as Emmet, Mark Bailey as Mike, David Healy as Todd Whitbread, Matt Malloy as Otis and Edie Falco as Jane - The Waitress. Burke is pretty good being mysterious, Shelly is interesting as the dissatisfied and odd girl, and together their on screen relationship plays out oddly but is part of what keeps you watching, I didn't find myself laughing all that much, I think it was the eccentric characters and peculiar conversations that kept me going until the end, an alright comedy drama.

It irks me that Uverse gives this three of four stars, as many as it once gave the film Gandhi (I'm not sure, but their ratings might be based on IMDb scoring). It's sort of trying to be what Bourne Identity became so much more successfully, and it failed. Davis and Jackson are wonderfully skilled actors, and it is only their performances that make this worth watching, but this vehicle is ultimately a waste of their talent. The first hour is engaging, watching Davis and Jackson develop their relationship. But once the heavy violence and action start, it goes downhill fast. The lines delivered by the little girl (Zima) came out flat and unconvincing. Worse, they were said with an adorable lisp. Bierko is equally unconvincing (and miscast) as a smirking, sarcastic, wise-cracking bad guy. The dialog is so bad, it seems like a parody of itself. In bad films like this, just before the evil genius (who has captured and is holding the hero) orders the hero to be killed, he performs a monologue revealing to the hero his reason for doing evil and his secret plan to do more evil, in order to let the audience in on the ensuing danger. You may know that scene in Austin Powers International Man of Mystery (a much better film than this one), when Dr. Evil says, I'm going to place him in an easily escapable situation involving an overly elaborate and exotic death. That applies to a scene in this movie too. Most of this movie is terribly contrived, predictable, a cliché or just ridiculous. Davis is gratuitously stripped down to her underclothes in a few scenes (to nothing in one) to show off her toned body. You may not see that as a negative, as I did. I had to wonder how the bad guys didn't smell the gasoline Davis hides in the girl's doll just before the two are captured. Or why the girl waited until Davis expended all of her energy -- in a stupid and futile attempt to create a spark to ignite said gasoline by pounding on concrete with a crowbar -- and broke down in tears in frustration before she revealed to Davis that, by the way, she happened to have matches on her. How ironic and so convenient that the girl chose to hide in the very truck with the dangerous bomb that becomes involved in a high-speed chase. The scenes at the end meant to be touching are just corny. Oh, and the bloody makeup on Davis's face during the climax of the film makes her look like a crazy clown.

They join two newly hired servants for a dinner hosted by the mysterious couple known only as Mr. and Mrs. U.N. Owen. The ten people settle into Owen's mansion and prepare for dinner. Strangely, they seem to be the only ones on Indian Island. Their host and hostess are discovered to be absent, but Owen leaves a recording which accuses each guest of murder in various degrees. Understandably, most want to leave the island quickly &#x96; but there is no boat. Then, the Ten Little Indian islanders begin to drop dead, one-by-one. Like the nursery rhyme, a figurine on the dining room table features Ten Little Indians. Every time a guest dies, one of the small Indians is broken...The ensemble must discover what is happening before they are all gone, thus ending the rhyme, and then there were none...This is a marvelous adaptation of Agatha Christie's stage play, itself based on her novel. Trying to solve the mystery is nearly impossible, especially if you've read the book. The differences, originally approved by Ms. Christie and brought to a witty screenplay by Dudley Nichols, make the plot perfect for the big screen. One character difference works especially well in the movies &#x96; in fact, this version delivers the story with a keen awareness of the medium (used as the singular of media; in this case, the movies). Giving character actors Barry Fitzgerald and Walter Huston top-billing, while casting lower case stars Louis Hayward and June Duprez in the romantic roles Director Rene Clair guides the cast and cameras around with elevating intrigue. This is the best of his short Hollywood career.********* And Then There Were None (10\/31\/45) Rene Clair ~ Barry Fitzgerald, Walter Huston, Louis Hayward, June Duprez ","genre":null},{"date":"8 August 2014","score":"","review":" On a cold and windy afternoon, eight strangers arrive on isolated Indian Island off the southern coast of England.

Understandably, most want to leave the island quickly &#x96; but there is no boat. Then, the Ten Little Indian islanders begin to drop dead, one-by-one. Like the nursery rhyme, a figurine on the dining room table features Ten Little Indians. Every time a guest dies, one of the small Indians is broken...The ensemble must discover what is happening before they are all gone, thus ending the rhyme, and then there were none...This is a marvelous adaptation of Agatha Christie's stage play, itself based on her novel. Trying to solve the mystery is nearly impossible, especially if you've read the book. The differences, originally approved by Ms. Christie and brought to a witty screenplay by Dudley Nichols, make the plot perfect for the big screen. One character difference works especially well in the movies &#x96; in fact, this version delivers the story with a keen awareness of the medium (used as the singular of media; in this case, the movies). Giving character actors Barry Fitzgerald and Walter Huston top-billing, while casting lower case stars Louis Hayward and June Duprez in the romantic roles Director Rene Clair guides the cast and cameras around with elevating intrigue. This is the best of his short Hollywood career.********* And Then There Were None (10\/31\/45) Rene Clair ~ Barry Fitzgerald, Walter Huston, Louis Hayward, June Duprez ","genre":"Crime, Drama, Mystery"},{"date":"8 August 2014","score":"","review":" On a cold and windy afternoon, eight strangers arrive on isolated Indian Island off the southern coast of England.
