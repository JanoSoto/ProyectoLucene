He starts out with two friends\/partners but makes more along the way. One of them is Geoffrey Chaucer(Paul Bettany) who is this sophisticated and eloquent talker and writer that basically works as an announcer for Thatcher. And one of the most likable character in this movie, Paul Bettany really steals the show. Even if William Thatcher isn't of noble birth he is a knight at heart but just not on paper, which is one of the big conflict in this movie. And also the rivalry from a very superficial, smug and one dimensional antagonist played by Rufus Sewell. Rufus Sewell, he is good at playing very dis-likable character.

Michael Keaton is a pretty good actor but they could of gotten a better actor for the job. When I picture batman I see a big strong tough looking guy that looks like he can fight. Keaton just did not fill that description. I did give it a 5 because I do realize it was mad much before all the technology was to make the dark knight. It is the second best Batman movie if you count the dark knight trilogy as a whole.

This movie holds the distinction of being the only Alfred Hitchcock movie in which an actor won an Oscar for their performance. Hitchcock made so many great movies with great acting performances from top stars spanning so many years, so I simply find it amazing that only one acting performance won an Oscar out of all the movies he made. Joan Fontaine was great in this movie and deserved the Oscar, but I also think she deserved an Oscar for her performance as the second Mrs. de Winter in Rebecca (1940) a year earlier. I also think Judith Anderson should have won Best Supporting Actress in Rebecca as well. Oh well.Some people have a hard time accepting Cary Grant playing a villain in this movie. When people think of Cary Grant, they think of him playing a certain type of character other than a villain. Myself, I don't have any problem with him playing a villain because what it comes down to is something very simple -- you just need to realize he's an ACTOR, and actors are supposed to be VERSATILE, not one dimensional. Really good actors have the ability to play all kinds of different roles, and really it comes down to just separating what he's done in other movies from what he did in Suspicion and ditching any preconceived view you have of him. It's that simple.This is one of those movies that starts a little slow but gets better and more suspenseful as it progresses. You just need to be patient and let things unfold. So many of Hitchcock's black and white movies from the 1940s are great movies but are often overlooked in favor of the movies from his prime, which I see as the period of time from about 1951-1964.Overall, this is a good movie with a great acting performance from Joan Fontaine. Cary Grant was great, also. I recommend it highly. If you're new to Hitchcock movies, I recommend starting with one of his classics from his prime years, such as Strangers On A Train (1951), Rear Window (1954), Vertigo (1958), North By Northwest (1959), Psycho (1960), The Birds (1963), and Marnie (1964). If you want to start in the 1940s, I of course recommend Suspicion as well as Rebecca (1940), Saboteur (1942), Shadow Of A Doubt (1943), Lifeboat (1944), Spellbound (1945), Notorious (1946), and Rope (1948).

I also think he was a great story-teller, not using much dialog, but still creating a wonderful atmosphere and conflicts. And Once Upon A Time In The West shows all that talent. It's my favorite western of all time (I also consider it the best) and my favorite Leone film, and it's one of my top 5 favorite films. Or maybe it's tied with the Dollar's Trilogy and Once Upon A Time in America, but I notice myself coming back to this film the most. While I think this is a superior movie to The Good, The Bad and The Ugly (often regarded as his best), I think that has one thing better. Clint Eastwood, he is a better actor than Charles Bronson. While Bronson gives a pretty good performance, he's essentially playing the Man With No Name, Eastwood does do it better. Rest of the performances are excellent. From Woody Strode's cameo to Henry Fonda's evil antagonist, all are great. Jason Robards is probably the best one, as Cheynne. He's fun, smart and a bit of a badass. But Fonda gives a great performance as well, he plays the villain. Which is bizarre seeing Fonda killing a whole family and being so goddamn evil, but it works. He as cast as him, because of his reputation of being the good guy. Also Claudia Cardinale is very beautiful and is pretty good, though cliché...But we all know the performances don't make a Leone film. What makes it is the direction, cinematography and music. All are absolutely masterful. Let's start with the direction.. Like most of Leone's film, this is a slow moving film. So if you don't like westerns in general, I wouldn't recommend this. You will be probably bored, or maybe you will like the style. And me saying this is a slow movie is not an insult. It's a fact. The slow pace gives it's mood and atmosphere is has. The tension is high and the gun fights are more exciting. BTW, there are not that much gun play going on. If you want gun crazy violence in west, watch Django (1966) or The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. This is more intelligent than those movie though. It focuses on a period in the west, when the railroads came, capitalism came as well. The end of the bandits and beginning a new evil. The films main theme is death, actually Leone said that the pace of the film supposed to be like the last moments before you die. Like most of Italian westerns, this movie is operatic, but Leone preferred to say ballet of violence. Everything is huge and dramatical, it makes it an very epic movie. This was also about you knowledge of previous westerns. Leone makes a lot of references\/homages to old westerns. It even has Leone trademark, typical western characters, almost showing them as mythical creatures. The first 10 minutes are incredible, direction-wise. It's 10 minutes of no dialog, no music, just atmosphere and expecting something. That's one thing people miss about Leone, he knew when to inform the audience and when keep a secret. In the first 10 minutes you don't know what or who are they waiting for and why are they there. And that gunfight is excellent BTW. My favorite moment is the Saltwater massacre. No I'm not a sadist, but how that scene is handled is beyond perfect. There is weird tension in that moments, then when the gun men start killing the family, the music doesn't start, you don't even see who is doing it and where. When the kid runs outside, with that tracking camera shot, the music comes, fast and epic. That moment always gives me goosebumps. It's just so well shot and directed. The cinematography is as excellent as everything else in this. Mixing close-ups and John Ford like wide-shots together, creating a almost surreal, yet beautiful feel. You can see that Leone was influenced by Ford, when Jill goes through the Valley, it's just like a John Ford film.I love the film, one of my favorite.

THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS isn't to be taken serious because if you did then you'd see one flaw after another in regards to the story itself. Like a lot of summer blockbusters, this one here has had way too many Red Bulls as every single scene is just over-the-top and has some testosterone going overboard. That's not to say this is a bad thing because there's no question that the film remains entertaining as a pure action movie as we're given some likable characters as well as some great racing scenes. I think most people are going to be coming to this thing for the fast cars and the various chases and this here is where the film won't let you down. There are some terrific stunt sequences, although I will admit that a few of them appear to be too much CGI and not enough actual driving. With that said, there are some great ones here including the ending, which I won't spoil here. It also doesn't hurt that we're given some characters that we can like even if I think the screenplay doesn't do a couple of them justice. Both Walker and Diesel are very believable in their roles as is Michelle Rodriquez, Jordana Brewster and even Ted Levine in his role. I will say at times it's somewhat hard to root for the main guys even though we do like this. This is especially true during the final sequence when the truck is being hijacked. Still, THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS is a fun ride as long as you don't expect some serious piece of art.

LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL is a rather unique film because it should have been a complete disaster. I mean, how do you really add laughs to the horror of the Holocaust?

According to my movie collection database we have had it since 2008 and last evening we finally got around watching it.This is a quite okay movie. It will not blow your socks off but it is fairly okay and worth watching. It is a nice thriller\/fugitive style movie to watch on a middle-of-the-week evening. I would probably not have been impressed had I gone to a theater to watch it but watching it as a TV-movie it was quite enjoyable. There are the usual silly moments that tend to be in these kinds of movies of course, starting with the stupid wife who just has to pick up the bloody knife just before the police arrives. Why do all (most) script writers have to put that crap into every movie? I do generally like Tommy Lee Jones even though he tends to look and act pretty much the same no matter which movie he is in. I guess I like stability. The plot is okay. It is a fairly conventional husband frames wife, wife goes after husband kind of story and does not really provide any surprises.One thing that caught my attention was that the car dealer apparently could do a credit check on a woman that was, as was found out later in the movie, dead since three years. I think someone missed the QA-checking of the script in terms of credibility there but then, as I said, the movie will not blow your socks of and the plot is fairly standard Hollywood fare with the usual silly stuff in it.

This is like a feast for a person starving for good cinema, good storytelling, and flawless acting. Like THE JOY LUCK CLUB, it is an epic, an emotional banquet.Fugui (You Ge) and his wife Jiazhen (the incomparable Gong Li) are young parents expecting their second child within a few months. They are financially well off and living comfortably, but Fugui has a terrible addiction to all night gambling. Soon enough, he has lost everything the family owns, and they are paupers overnight.Jiazhen takes their daughter Fengxia and leaves Fugui devastated. He also loses his father to a heart attack and his mother is ailing. He is forced to take lodging in a crummy apartment and just try to get his life back together, becoming a street peddler, then a performer of shadow puppetry. Jiazhen decides to give Fugui one more chance, and seeing as he has nothing left to gamble away, things begin to look up.Until one night, during one of Fugui's puppet shows, he and his troupe are caught up in the civil war against the Liberation Army (pre- communism). A prisoner of war for months, he becomes an entertainer for the Army, and then set free to go home. With a new government in power, Fugui and Jiazhen begin yet another attempt to rebuild. This movie is neither pro nor anti communism. It is simply the portrait of a family caught up in times of tremendous change. A decade later, the family has merged into the mission of Chairman Mao, helping with steel production and eating in communist canteens instead of cooking their own meals. All scrap metal is donated to the cause, and even the children are expected to work long, hard hours smelting, lest their families be thought of as politically backward. They live their lives in happy anxiety, glad to be alive and together, but always wary of offending someone who could punish them. Fengxia has been left mute by a fever some years prior, and her younger brother Youquin meets with a heart-wrenching tragedy at this time.Two decades after the film begins, China has taken the Great Leap. Fengxia is growing up, and her family introduces her to kindhearted Erxi. They marry and soon are expecting, but more tragedy is in store. The ending of this film is open to discussion, but basically the point is, life is not a destination, it's a journey. Who knows what becomes of this family after the credits? What are their hopes of the future? They were once a rich family, and it's unlikely they'll ever be rich again. Do they even care at this point? After the tragic losses of their children, how do they have the strength to live on? Perhaps because Erxi, who has stayed near them in spite of his own tremendous loss, and because of their grandson, who lived after Fengxia died in childbirth. Perhaps that precious child, that Little Bun is all it takes to motivate them to keep going. In the face of loss and tragedy, a new blessing makes all the difference. People need something to hope for and dream for, otherwise it would all seem so pointless.For all its richness and tapestry, To Live carries a simple and universal message about the strength of the human spirit and the will to live.

It was marketed and hyped up as a true story, that three teenagers went into the woods in search of the Blair witch in October 1994 and never returned. Then their camcorder footage was found a year later.The whole idea behind this movie was to scare its audience with the concept of making the audience get frightened of things they don't see. It's called psychological horror. Other horror movies of the past have accomplished this goal. The Haunting (1963) is a perfect example. The Haunting was a professionally made movie with a musical score, the whole nine yards. In contrast, The Blair Witch Project was filmed with a camcorder and a shaky one at that. There is no music in the film. It's raw. It has a skeletal budget. It has the sounds of the day and the sounds of the night and the sounds of profane teenagers. It's basically a reality film about some teens who are lost in the woods in search of a legendary witch that supposedly lives there. The fact that they're looking for a witch and lost at the same time makes them increasingly frightened and frustrated as the movie progresses.The main problem I have with this film is that the footage is so shaky and amateur-ish. This movie is unwatchable. It'll make you dizzy and give you a headache. It's fine to use a camcorder. I thought it was a unique way to film a documentary movie. But at least make the footage watchable. I can understand the camera shaking at times when the kids are running away from something that's scaring them, but to have shaky footage when they're just sitting around and talking or when planning their trip is really inexcusable. If I want to watch really bad and I mean REALLY bad and shaky camcorder footage, I can watch any one of the countless lame and shaky videos that people I know have made throughout the years. I don't know what's so hard about keeping a steady camera. This film would have been better if the camera-work was better. Instead of feeling scared, I found myself being distracted by the terrible camera-work and feeling dizzy with a headache, also. The bad camera-work robbed me of any scared feeling I was supposed to have when watching this film.

This is not a film for everyone, however; it is frequently brutal and depressing in the emotional honesty of its story. That said, anyone interested should absolutely give this film a look. The film is based upon true events and the tragic circumstances of Brandon Teena (Hilary Swank), a trans man dealing with a sexual identity crisis. She wants to be seen as a man desperately, and because she unwisely acts upon her instincts, she ends up raped and dead by the end of the film. She realizes too late that she can't run from her past completely. Brandon remains a fully sympathetic character, and much of this is due to Swank's masterful performance. She has a sense of innocence about her, as she desires to find her place in the world and become the person who she wants to be, but she forgets to think about the consequences. She flies too close to the sun and ultimately pays the price for it. Ironically, she is one of the few characters in the movie fully willing to seek what she wants. The family she stays with for much of the film lives a morally and emotionally empty life. Only the daughter, Lana (Chloe Sevigny) seems to recognize this; she hates her working-class job and the dangers she frequently has to face around ex-convict John Lotter (Peter Saarsgard). Regardless of her gender, it is no wonder she ends up falling for Brandon. Both hate societal norms and wish to escape to Memphis to live better lives together. They both ultimately find themselves unable to, as Lotter has his own perspective on those societal norms, and he simply can't take any variations. He's a monster, yes, but his motivation for raping and murdering Brandon is one of confusion. He can't comprehend that the concept of gender isn't as simplistic as he thought, and more importantly, that the world isn't as simplistic as it seems. This is a difficult movie to watch, as it has the level of impact akin to that of a classical Greek tragedy. Brandon is unable to overcome her fatal flaw, and it ends up costing her her life. However, it is also extremely insightful and touching with regards to her courage to go and pursue her desires. We could all learn something from Brandon, but we must go about it in a wiser manner.Overall Rating 9\/10- Seriously Guys, See This Movie.

I love how good all of the characters are like Will(Matt Damon), Chuck(Ben Affleck), Sean(Robin Williams), and skylah(MInnie Driver). Matt and Ben's best film of their career. It goes through the horrible abuse Will Hunting faced as a child and how he overcomes it. We also find out late in the film that Sean the therapist also dealt with some abuse as a child. My favorite line is when will starts out by saying he used to just set a belt, a stick, and a wrench on the table and say choose then Sean says I would have to go with the belt then will says no I used to go with the wrench Sean sayswhy will says cause f*** him thats why.

Sometimes I despair at the reviewers on here.Anyway, back to the film. Omar (Gordon Warnecke) is a young Asian guy who goes to work for his Thatcherite uncle (Saeed Jaffrey). His ambition is to renovate his uncle's run-down laundrette. He gets in his white mate Johnny (Daniel Day Lewis) to give him a hand and the two guys fall in love.My Beautiful Laundrette completely encapsulates the zeitgeist of 1980's Britain, tackling everything from racial tension, immigration, generation differences, class differences, Thatcherism and homosexuality. I say 'tackle'- it's presented but the viewer is allowed to make their own minds up. This is primarily a coming-of-age film and on that level it can appeal to everyone.As for the arguments that you can only like this film if you fit into one of the criteria portrayed here or the period it was set in, they're completely ridiculous. So, we can only like Schindler's List if we're a Nazi or a Jew and were alive in the forties? Come on people. The only criteria I fit in with this film is that I live in Britain- not even London, where the film's set.What a lot of people dislike about the film is that it portrays a lot of the tensions happening in Britain but it does so on a very human level. No character is just a victim of the state. It's a light romantic comedy that lets us see the violence and racism but doesn't linger, making it more powerful when things do happen.As for the relationship between Omar and Johnny, it's portrayed very tenderly (and very sexily, though tasteful). What is rare for a 'gay film'- a label given to any film that has gay characters in- is that the characters aren't tortured over their sexuality or punished. It's just portrayed as a normal loving relationship and the two actors- both straight- are very convincing.Now Daniel Day Lewis has bagged his third Oscar, breaking the record for Best Actor, how does he fare in a very early film in his career? I really enjoyed his performance- you can see there's something about him, even at this age. His facial structure is outstanding- he looks very striking. And there's none of the mannerisms you might expect from an actor destined to do well. He comes across as a fresh talent- which he was.

A proper one, with Sean Connery. &#x96; Steven Spielberg.In a prophetic article on Raiders of the Lost Ark, Jonathan Rosenbaum predicted the rise of set piece cinema. He called the directors of these films disciples of Hitchcockian storyboards in which The Sequence becomes the raison d'etre of film-making. These sequences would themselves increasingly demand more time and money, as the only way to satiated audience would be to offer bigger and more outrageous set-pieces.The James Bond franchise was arguably the first big budget series to exploit set-piece cinema. To minimise financial risks, each Bond script is virtually identical. The stunts differ, the exotic locales are alternated, but beyond these superficial changes the Bond plot is always the same. By the time George Lucas started working on Raiders, there'd already been 12 Bond flicks. The Bond formula had been set in stone and proven successful. All that was needed were a few minor cosmetic changes, and Lucas would have a franchise of his own.As such, all four Indiana Jones movies follow the Bond formula precisely. First we have the pre-story action sequence, a self-contained action sequence in which Indy searches for an artifact. In Raiders it's a Golden Idol, in Temple of Doom it's a flask of Ashes and in The Last Crusade it's the Cross of Coronado. In each film, Indy finds the artifact and then promptly loses it to the villains.After this pre-film action sequence, we then get the exposition. In the Bond films, this is where Bond learns of his mission. In Indiana Jones, this is where Indy learns of some religious myth. Bond and Indy then travel to an exotic location, Indy typically meets an attractive woman (who is always later captured), the audience is introduced to the sub-villain, and we're treated to two action sequences. At the end of the second act, Indy and Bond are then always captured by the central villain.Of course our heroes then escape, there's a final big action sequence (always, in Indy's case, involving a vehicle), and an ending in which the bad guys are killed by the very artifact they sought. There are repeated plot beats, like Indy making a deal with the enemy, run-ins with henchmen, repeated scenes dealing with Indy's phobias, but basically the film follows the standard Bond formula. As Spielberg remarked after first reading the Raiders script It's Bond without the hardware.As all Indiana Jones films are essentially the same, the only way to judge them are to pit their action sequences against one another. Each film has 5 action sequences. Raiders has one sequence involving a giant boulder, one involving an indoor gunfight, one involving a running battle with henchmen in Egypt, one involving a fistfight underneath a plane and one involving a moving truck. As what what constitutes action continuously gets faster and harder, most of these sequences are deemed tame by modern audiences.Temple also has five showcase sequences. One involving a song and dance routine, one involving a chase from henchmen, one involving an extended fist fight, one involving mine carts, and a final showdown on a rope bridge. Most of these sequences have aged well, the rope sequence the most tense moment in the trilogy, the others striking a tone that alternates between ultra sadistic and goofily over-the-top. More than other Indy films, Temple still feels audacious; part vaudeville movie, part musical, part quasi-racist B movie in the mould of 1930 serials. Opening with a rendition of Anything Goes, it's totally ridiculous. Spielberg fans hate it.Crusade likewise has five action sequences. One involving young Indy, one involving a Venice chase, one involving a showdown with air-planes, one involving a motorcycle chase and a final battle in which Indy faces a tank. While the opening and closing sequences are very strong, you sense Spielberg bored with everything in between.In contrast, Temple is the Indy film which holds up best today, its cinematography richer, its camera work better, its pace faster, its tone unashamedly goofy (shades of Verhoeven) and with a hero who's simultaneously more muscular and more vulnerable than usual. Spielberg would go on to condemn and all but disown the film &#x96; he thinks its sadistic and in poor taste; he would say the same of Jaws - but it's the fact that Temple embraces the baseness that lurks in all his films that makes this Indy outing less hypocritical. Elsewhere Doom goes beyond emulating its influences (Stagecoach, Sierra Madre, King Soloman's Mines, Zorro, Valley of the Kings, Lawrence of Arabia, The Naked Jungle, the same plot as Gunga Din, often misread as a pro-colonalist film) to replicate wholesale the Colonialist\/Orientalist\/racist\/sexist tone of 1930s serials, characters exoticized and demonized, the Other base or thoroughly in need of white salvation and the script falling back on various racist binaries. This repeats the treatment of Arabs and Nazis in the other two films (the way Spielberg\/Lucas yearn for 1930s popular culture goes hand in hand with the decade's rise in Reaganism).Nowadays, of course, popcorn films are moving away from what Rosenbaum called set piece cinema. With spectacle dead, the majority of modern pop-corn flicks abandon elaborate set-pieces and instead seek to bombard their audiences with information. This is the post-cinema, cyber age, blockbusters now overwhelming audiences with plot. Thirty years ago we marvelled at Indy outrunning a giant boulder. Today, we salivate over narrative gymnastics, popcorn plots seeking to excite us with the sheer density of their tales.

I didn't find it boring, nor the story complicated. However this is not a 10\/10 movie. There are segments in this that are like sketches from Monty Python. Perhaps there to give the audience members who are going to sleep...a little injection of humour (weak humour). The De Niro character rapes his childhood sweet heart in the back of a car (so Sergio Leone). He also rapes a lady during a diamond heist. He is forced to go in a line up so the lady can inspect the genitals of the accused. Then there is the Hospital with the new born babies sketch. Mildly amusing, but perhaps only to middle aged Italian movie directors. I think i ought to say here...this is a gangster flick. The ending...where we have to work out what happens to the James Wood character combined with the was the whole movie an opium dream ? conspiracy theory gives the film an in--authentic feel. The story is very simple and frankly i don't care if it was a Valium dream. Its a fairly well made movie...but nothing to get Ga Ga about.
