Also Dmitry hates it was all a dream stories, of which he considers American Psycho one. He thinks the movie fails as tragedy and comedy, because there are no consequences for Patrick Bateman.Here's part of his letter to me regarding this filmwhat's the point of the story? is it about a shark among sharks who has a touch of humanity which makes him hate himself and disagree with the world he lives in - then what's the sacrifice? or the tragedy? he leaves his fiancé and makes the false confession but it's not enough, dramatically. ed norton confesses to the police. then shoots himself in the mouth. that's sacrifice. the point of American Psycho, i guess, is that he has no way to redeem himself and that's the tragedy. that would be fine if not for all the murders. and again, if they are in his head and he thinks they are real then he is not merely having a nervous breakdown (which he never really has) but he is psychotic and that's never dealt with. Following is a response I wrote him in 2007 Bateman is psychotic, which is all that is dealt with, in my opinion. Start with the title. And the fact that everything he does is nuts. Even his friends kind of think he's weird, and they're barely awake enough to recognize him. He is Tantalus, staring at his own reflection and failing to grasp it until he goes mad with coveting himself.The joke of this story, I think, is a man trying desperately to have a tragedy, or a comedy, or any kind of a dramatic life, but he's just a doofus who happens to be very rich. He's Bruce Wayne without a good idea in his head. He's unable to really have, for instance, a sense of accomplishment, or a need unfulfilled, or a sense of loss, or values, really - since he's at the very, very top of Olympus, having achieved the top 2% of the planet in terms of resources (women and $100 plates and blow and limousines), he should be able to be happy. BUT THERE IS NO DRAMA IN HAVING EVERYTHING. So that's the comic premise he can't have a tragedy, and he is driven mad by the attempt. The tragedy would be A Clockwork Orange, a man so blasé and jaded that he follows the baser impulses of popular culture because it really doesn't matter what he does since society's such wreckage anyway, and whose real tragedy is that he actually can fulfill himself and be happy by doing evil, a more cynical sensibility than I think is found in American Psycho.At this point, I think there are two valid ways to look at what constitutes the story.One is that he hasn't really committed these murders which should be horrific but aren't, and that he's having a nervous breakdown from trying so hard to transgress and being so impotent that his sex fantasies have become indistinguishable in his retarded mind from his real life. His fantasies, also, are not enough to make his life interesting; fantasies never are; and he is just an empty Lord & Taylor bag that a homeless man is using for a pillow. His friends see this, aren't interested enough to pity him, or, worse, think his confession is just a joke that they don't really get, so they kind of laugh along until their feelings are hurt. In trying to suffer punishment he only receives minor scorn. He is such a failure, a cipher, that even his crimes don't really exist. This is an okay interpretation, but less interesting than The other way you could look at it, which is that he's so desperate for passion and fulfillment that, like Hercules, he really did commit these crimes, but that AGAIN THERE ARE ZERO CONSEQUENCES. When he confesses and nobody believes him, and even when his friends offer evidence to the contrary, that's just because they're as stupid as he is, and that they mistook him for someone else and also mistook his victim for someone else and they're all interchangeable anyway, and that it's just too much trouble for these people even to help the detective find the murderer, since nobody really liked Paul Allen in the first place. Anyway they're all self-absorbed and inattentive to really important details, not like which restaurant shall we go to, which is a minor detail that's very important to them, but big details like who am I talking to? I think this is the funnier interpretation, and I think that the movie ends on enough of an ambiguous note to allow for it.It is an imperfect film. It has great performances, many great scenes, a few very nice recurring themes, and many flaws. The disappearing detective is as you point out a problem. There is contempt in the lens, which I agree is to no one's advantage. I think we should see the guys hanging out more, see more of what pathetic losers they are, or more of how he's more or less screwed up than they. There is too much time spent with the character alone. To really get Travis Bickle's alienation, we don't only show him alone in his apartment playing G. Gordon and writing cryptic messages to himself. We show him at the movies.But man, Christian Bale on the phone, talking to that answering machine. So beautiful. We are capable of so much, we humans.

After all, unlike those typical war movies made from Hollywood, even though the government probably don't pay them any money, most of the war movies are trying to tell the whole world how great the US soldiers are. whatever the wars they are fighting for, it seems that they are always fighting for the right cause. And the US audiences generally like to pay money to watch that kind of movies.This movie is entirely the opposite, from what I watched from the DVD extras, not many studios were interested in financing for this movie. And it didn't make a lot of money, either. Michael J. Fox talked during the interview, at that time, a lot of people paid money to watch honey, I shrunk the kids, look at it now, who actually remember that movie.In those socialist countries (aka communist countries, known to the westerners), those governments always like to teach their students that in capitalist countries, greedy capitalists only goal is to make money. Only in socialist countries, can the real people make movies for all the working classes. In reality, with this kind of theme, this movie can never be made in the socialist countries. Even if it was filmed, it can never pass the government's censorship, and the directors, actors might be banned for a long, long time.Only in USA, can people have the freedom to make a movie like this. Even though money talks in the court room, at least, some of the soldiers got sent to prisons for a long time. Those are the reasons why there are so many people say that they are proud to be US citizens.These kind of things probably happen all over the world.

Now first off, I'm usually not one of those race baiting affirmative action types. But it struck me about half way through this movie that nobody we've met is Hispanic. Hello! Not even any minor characters. Seriously even in 1995 at least half of Arizona was Hispanic. Had to be. All of the main characters in this film however are black, and a few of the supporting cast is white, but that's it! And of course, the white people are generally bad, inconsequential, or not to be trusted. Anyway, about the plot....The story deals with four 30 something black women who cannot find a good man who isn't already married. Three of them at one point or another sleep with married men, two of them hoping that the married man will one day divorce their wives. Another woman's husband leaves her on New Year's Eve to be with his mistress after openly confessing the affair and his desire for their marriage to be over. But apparently the worst thing about that is the fact that his mistress is (gasp!) a white woman! In fact the wife (Bassett) seems more upset about that fact than anything. Since the concept of black men sleeping with and or settling down with white women is brought up more than once during the film in a negative way, one wonders how many men chose white women over author Terry McMillan. Maybe some of these black women might broaden their horizons and perhaps look for love outside their own skin color once in a while. Yet this film never even presents that as the slightest possibility for any of these characters.The film is never boring though, and has strong acting performances from most of the characters. The cast is full of easily recognizable faces and names. Even Leon from Madonna's Like a Prayer video has a role as one of the men in these women's lives. The film shows many different potential suitors for these ladies, but also gives most of them a fatal flaw why he cannot be husband material. By the end of the film, only two of the four seem to have found good men, while the other two have at least come to their senses about the men they liked best. These women are very attractive, and the whole production feels like a big budget soap opera. Whitney Houston looks especially fine as this was made before Bobby Brown had her all strung out on crack. Antoine Fuqua's wife Lela Rochon is quite a site as well. Angela Bassett looks better in how Stella Got Her Groove Back. Her hair is just too short here after she cuts if off in a rage. And for all you in the audience who like a woman with meat on her bones, you'll love Loretta Devine. And her character seems the most grounded of the four. She doesn't chase after married men. She has enough trouble looking after her son. The film isn't great but I was never bored. And that isn't bad considering it lasts for two whole hours.

Now first off, I'm usually not one of those race baiting affirmative action types. But it struck me about half way through this movie that nobody we've met is Hispanic. Hello! Not even any minor characters. Seriously even in 1995 at least half of Arizona was Hispanic. Had to be. All of the main characters in this film however are black, and a few of the supporting cast is white, but that's it! And of course, the white people are generally bad, inconsequential, or not to be trusted. Anyway, about the plot....The story deals with four 30 something black women who cannot find a good man who isn't already married. Three of them at one point or another sleep with married men, two of them hoping that the married man will one day divorce their wives. Another woman's husband leaves her on New Year's Eve to be with his mistress after openly confessing the affair and his desire for their marriage to be over. But apparently the worst thing about that is the fact that his mistress is (gasp!) a white woman! In fact the wife (Bassett) seems more upset about that fact than anything. Since the concept of black men sleeping with and or settling down with white women is brought up more than once during the film in a negative way, one wonders how many men chose white women over author Terry McMillan. Maybe some of these black women might broaden their horizons and perhaps look for love outside their own skin color once in a while. Yet this film never even presents that as the slightest possibility for any of these characters.The film is never boring though, and has strong acting performances from most of the characters. The cast is full of easily recognizable faces and names. Even Leon from Madonna's Like a Prayer video has a role as one of the men in these women's lives. The film shows many different potential suitors for these ladies, but also gives most of them a fatal flaw why he cannot be husband material. By the end of the film, only two of the four seem to have found good men, while the other two have at least come to their senses about the men they liked best. These women are very attractive, and the whole production feels like a big budget soap opera. Whitney Houston looks especially fine as this was made before Bobby Brown had her all strung out on crack. Antoine Fuqua's wife Lela Rochon is quite a site as well. Angela Bassett looks better in how Stella Got Her Groove Back. Her hair is just too short here after she cuts if off in a rage. And for all you in the audience who like a woman with meat on her bones, you'll love Loretta Devine. And her character seems the most grounded of the four. She doesn't chase after married men.

The passion carries over what little flaws there are- I personally couldn't really stand the actor playing the soldier, though maybe it was some of the writing that came off poorly or self-consciously- and it works as modern film art for what it accomplishes which is one of those rare pure movies for women that doesn't reek of sentimentality or kitsch. It's got some hard issues to face, but it's done in a beautiful style with the camera- itself, as some have noted its own character- and modernity in its thoughts and dialogs.The star, Connie Marchand, aside from being an unusually beautiful blonde (I almost thought at one point Varda couldn't get Deneauve and settled on a very respectable 2nd choice) conveys that sense of being young and pretty and possibly talented but also unhappy and disillusioned by what might happen not just with her potential illness but herself in general. There's one short scene I really loved where she's just walking down the street and the point of view goes back and forth, jarringly, between herself and those men (and men) of all ages taking a glance or look at her. Is it because she's a semi-famous singer or because she just happens to be a pretty blonde walking down the street? A similar scene occurs when she goes to a café and puts on one of her songs on the jukebox and everyone goes about their business.Varda, at the least, gets us as much as she can inside her head-space, be it in small scenes like that or something truly grandiose like when she sings the sad song written by Michael Legrand and as it continues and rises it culminates into something too emotional for her to sustain. She tries to explain it as well, which makes it worse. It also helps in Cleo from 5 to 7 that the structure is broken up as it is in the chapters; another French New-Wave film from 1962, Vivre sa Vie, may have featured a better structural grasp on the chapter break-up, but here Varda seems to suggest that it's based upon both the limitation that time presents for someone like Cleo and for a post-modern break from traditional narrative.Why be told simply this is the end of a scene, this is the beginning, this is the middle? With Varda, as with others from that age group in France making movies at the time, there were no firm rules except to be true to the artistic self, and as the camera and editing take on lives of their own and the star becomes something more as the film progresses, it to becomes a strong piece of art. Some it dated? Maybe, it's France over 45 years ago. But its impact remains due to its dedication to its character, to women living lives uncertain and odd, and to Paris.

You get a hint of this in the long (maybe too long) train scene. The appearance of the people changes from finely dressed ones to gabby untidy ones. And the ugly reality of what the west really is, is thrown into your face when Blake enters the city. The people, streets, looks, workers, head of factory&#133;, everything is different from where Blake comes from. But the film seems to be trying to say that the people in the west can't be blamed for harshness and cruelty, this is the only way of survival. And so we see Blake change from a polite innocent young man (he has to shoot three times at Charlie before eventually killing him) to an expert killer. The white paper flowers being stamped over in the mud seem to indicate that Blake's innocence is destroyed for ever, and that he is will never have a way back. Dead Man is also the story of Indian mysticism. In the beginning of their encounter Blake doesn't understand what Nobody says and does, but gradually starts to get interested. He is left alone by nobody, so he can continue the journey on his own, and start having his own visions. He does see strange things, but that might be because Nobody has taken away his glasses! After finding Nobody again, Blake has more confidence in him, and doesn't question him that much. Another important feature of the film is the way it depicts Indians. Nobody is an educated Indian who is familiar with his own traditions and rituals as well (that's why he's called Nobody, his neither a full Indian nor a full European). He is Blake's guide through his difficult journey, and gets him ready for his death, or trip to the other world. This is the obvious part, but there are other things to be pointed out about him. Nobody either believes in reincarnation, or is stupid enough to believe that his companion is actually the 18th century English poet, saying it's so strange that you don't remember any of your poetry.He is helping Blake, but favors his own interests when he has to choose. He simply trades Blake's glasses, knowing how much he is in need of them, and I wont believe that he did his because Blake would see more clearly without them! Nobody is helping Blake prepare for his important journey to the other world, helping him to purify his soul through fasting and seeing visions, but on the other hand he is the one who leads Blake into more murder; he insists that Blake go to the three homosexuals, he calmly kills the first one of them, and so Blake is forced into his second murder by killing the second one, and this is the last time he is nervous about such an act. Nobody seems satisfied when Blake kills the missioner that had offended him, he seems satisfied whenever Blake kills a stupid white man. Blake has hopes that Nobody will somehow help him survive, but all he does is to help him die. Well of course all this depends on one's viewpoint as well, and maybe some information about Indian rituals and beliefs is needed to understand things better.Some reviewers have claimed that Jarmucsh hasn't been successful in conveying his message to his audience. I accept this argument, a lot of religious and mystic symbols are mixed up with shocking violence, but one doesn't get what the director is really after in the end. One thing for sure, Blake doesn't choose his fate, everything is pre-determined, he doesn't choose to become a poet who Writes with blood, he only chose to sit in that train, and so the train fireman is able to predict everything, hell, grave, and the boat that takes Blake to his final destination.The movie is about death; the unchangeable fate, and so is in black and white. The music, composed by Billy Boy, the good selection of actors (specially Gary Farmer), and the frequent surprising, violent and shocking scenes manage to keep the movie from becoming dull.

Cameron is responsible for bringing us some of the best sci-fi in the last 25 years, having created the Terminator and even delved into the Alien franchise. Cameron's 1989 film seems to be a bit under-appreciated and overshadowed by his other accomplishments. The film follows the crew of an underwater oil rig who are enlisted to assist the military in searching for survivors in a downed nuclear submarine. Events take a turn for the worse when a hurricane forces their topside support to evacuate and the military lieutenant overseeing the operation in the rig begins to show signs of stress-induced psychosis. Soon, the stranded crew discover that they aren't alone on the ocean floor...First, I need to recommend that, if you plan to watch this movie, be sure to watch the special edition that was re-released to include an additional 27 minutes. The special edition restores the original ending for the film that goes into greater detail of the crew's discovery and the message James Cameron was trying to instill upon the audience about mankind. Despite the films near 3 hour runtime, you will hardly notice the time passing as the film never gets boring. Strong performances and high quality special effects will keep you engaged throughout.The casting in this movie was exceptional, with Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio headlining the film as the divorcing couple in charge of the rig crew. The best performance comes from Michael Biehn as Lieutenant Coffey and his slow mental deterioration as the high stress environment eats away at him. Even the supporting cast was of high quality and were a great addition to the film (particularly Todd Graff as Hippy, who I found to be a bit of a scene-stealer at times). The effects in this movie feel ahead of their time. While the film was created in 1989, it's effects were just as impressive (if not more) as movies released well into the mid-1990's.

But there are also those films that, perversely enough, I take pleasure in watching-- KNOWING, with full intention, that I will never watch them again. Terry Gilliam's debut as director, JABBERWOCKY, is definitely one of those.Starring Michael Palin, it's like an extended episode of RIPPING YARNS, which was dull & tedious to begin with. It's filmed in the style of MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL, which means its view of the ancient world is filthy and disgusting and hopeless, but it isn't 1\/10th as funny.The highlight is the DeWolff library tracks, among them, excerpts of both Night On Bald Mountain (when the champion is surrounded by The Black Knight's hoods, sworn to stop him so as to protect the monster for the benefit of the city's merchants), and Pictures at an Exhibition (heard when Dennis returns to the city in accidental triumph with the beast's decapitated head).The film's got some talented actors hidden in there... among them, it turns out, Harry H. Corbett, who was the and Son on England's STEPTOE AND SON, the younger partner of Wilfred Brambell, who played Paul's grandfather in A HARD DAY'S NIGHT. Because he's chasing after an innkeeper's wife, he gets Michael Palin to fill in for him when his master is chosen champion to face the monster.Also in there-- I KNEW I'd seen this guy before, but for the life of me could not place him-- was Graham Crowden as the head of a bunch of religious fanatics. He'd played Soldeed on the DOCTOR WHO story The Horns Of Nimon, and has long been accused of doing some of the worst over-acting in the show's history!! No wonder he seemed familiar, I knew I'd heard that raving lunatic voice somewhere before.Brian Glover (Lugg on CAMPION) was the city armorer whose shop is destroyed in a clumsy accident. And Kenneth Colley (who co-starred with Palin in an episode of RIPPING YARNS and was in the 2nd & 3rd STAR WARS films) is a fanatic who INSISTS he be catapulted to a violent yet glorious death. Insists!! Oh yeah, and the Black Knight (whose face we never see, of course) was David Prowse, who, the same year, became Darth Vader.See this only to satisfy curiosity... but if you do, go in with the lowest possible expectations.

So he invents a first sabotage that succeeds but one of the victims, the friend of the one who dies in it, becomes the prime suspect and run-away for the sabotage.

The chase after the real saboteur takes our young false suspect from Los Angeles to New York and to the top of the organization.

Sci-fi horror was treated to something new and different here, with scenes and concepts that were truly unique that hadn't been done before. I still think back to the time I saw the picture during it's original theatrical release, and marvel at the idea of the chest-burster for example. And I can't tell you how much the scene with Ash (Ian Holm) that revealed his robotic form blew me completely away; it was almost too difficult to concentrate on the rest of the story. Then there was the title character itself, a creature assuming horrific proportions through the same process of metamorphosis that transforms caterpillars into butterflies, but here done with complete disregard for the norms of natural evolutionary process.What's striking in watching the film today is how both timely and timeless it is. Timely in that as a product of the Seventies, the set design seems almost minimalist, to the degree that sci-fi films of the 1940's and '50's were dated to reflect the technology of those periods. Timeless however in the constructs that work to achieve their intended effect in the mind of the viewer, a fear of the unknown and a fascination with fantastical creatures that have a right to exist only in our imagination. Something as simple as Brett (Harry Dean Stanton) picking up the reptilian shed skin of the chest burster claws away at one's mind, forcing the viewer to consider what might be in store for the survivors of this mission. Speaking of which, I haven't seen any comments on the role of the spaceship on this board. There was a point in the movie when it began to emerge that the Nostromo itself became a hostile entity to the crew. 'Mother' herself appeared to have, in the words of many a 'Star Trek' episode, a prime directive of it's own, that of investigating and securing alien life forms. Was there a more chilling moment in the story than the words Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) read as Mother's response to her question about the nature of of Nostromo's programming? - Crew Expendable. So it's thirty years since the release of Alien, and the film is just as fascinating to watch today as it was that long ago. Granted, some of the early going is a bit slow in the delivery, but as a set up to what follows it's a wait that's made worthwhile for the suspense that builds and reaches a crescendo in the second half. I'll take this one head and shoulders over any number of present day efforts that attempt to dazzle the audience with over the top action and mind blowing special effects, each successive effort attempting to outdo the one that came before. With Alien you have the real deal, a story and a creation that stands the test of time to emerge as an icon of popular movie and cultural entertainment.

Billy Wilder is an absolute genius, his stories always unfolding at the right pace, and his way of bringing them to the screen barely ever impeccable.This is the forties cinema. A story of love and betrayal, of manipulation and big money. The story of femme fatal Barbra Stanwick luring poor insurance salesman Walter Niff to kill her husband so they can be together.

Jim Carrey delivers a flawless performance as Truman Burbank, a made-for-television character unknowingly viewed by millions 24\/7 around the world. Truman's 'world,' the lovely 1950s'ish town of Seahaven is the creation of Cristof played wonderfully by Ed Harris. All the townsfolk including his wife Meryl (Laura Linney), best friend Marlon (Noah Emmerich), and even his mother (Holland Taylor) are in on charade. All goes well till Truman starts discovering how the town is staged. Wanting to see the world (including one true love Lauren (Natascha McElhone)), Truman desperately attempts to leave the Island and discover what's beyond Seahaven.I didn't see this movie when it was in theaters. Jim Carrey in a serious film, no thanks. Did rent it years later and couldn't believe how great this movie is. The story, cast, music, etc.. Everything perfect. This movie MUST be viewed more than once. Took me 3-4 times to truly appreciate the depth the film has to offer. It's an absolute shame this film didn't receive more Oscar nominations.Carry's performance is genius! Even subtle things, like when he repeatedly taps the light that fell from the sky, exactly what a child would do to first test a foreign object.

It sounds funny to call it a fairy tale, but it's not a full out great novel, either. Maybe it is something that exists somewhere in between, delighting readers and challenging critics. (Coming of age novel minimizes it.) Scout Finch is arguably the most charming female character in American fiction in the second half of the century, and the heart of the book is really her narration, and how she relates to everyone in her world, particularly her father. Through Scout's eyes we see the changing humanity of her older brother Jem. The author goes to great lengths to make Scout as adorable as possible and yes she is a little bit in love with her childhood self.The book, set in the 30s, is flavored by the coming pressures of the times in which it was written, the 1950s and 60s. The living room conversations among the women about the differences between North and South in their treatment of blacks were very recognizable. But, the book's power, for me, does not lie in the Tom Robinson trial and his subsequent fate, true as it was. That part moved along predictably enough, and Atticus weathers the town's outrages nobly, holding the klieg light steady for all who so choose to see the way out of darkness. No one does.Strangely, there was no portrayal of a married couple, to my reading. Most of the adult male characters' wives had died, and the women either lived alone or with a maid. Maybe it was meant to convey the dying South or maybe it reflects the author's own life or her assessment or faith (or lack of it) in the future of the South.Still, To Kill a Mockingbird is a portrayal of a once noble family, and a very decent family, grounded in some pretty good values and going out to experience life eagerly and with honor, not shrinking from anything.It's not a work of Great Fiction but there is something about it in line with great American works. What that something is, is hard to pin down. Maybe it is the richness in every sentence, the warmth and understanding. The recognizable history, the sweep of years and ages that one phrase embodies and evokes, and the nostalgia it stirs up. Maybe it is the everyday poetry of the language, instantly recognizable as classic American writing. Maybe it is the completely true characters, each one unique in a land where conformity was valued and enforced.The film necessarily cuts out a significant portion of the book but for the most part the choices made for what was left in are good ones. Still, the omissions include the development of important characters (Miss Maudie, Mrs DuBose, and Calpurnia among others), while other characters are left out entirely (Aunt Alexandra). A lot of family back-story is also cut. The result is that the outlines are there (albeit with some pretty steep mountains in the background!) and that seems to have satisfied a good many people.Phillip Alford as Jem was unquestionably the best casting choice of this movie, while Mary Badham's pampered background shows through. I picked up on a sullen, mocking reluctance in scenes requiring a demonstration of affection and lovingness. Alford, more down-home, does just fine, and is all boy, with a lovely voice. Dill is hardly anyone's notion of a beautiful child contest winner and is clearly not Southern. Peck certainly looks the part of Atticus Finch, and while Atticus clearly is a reserved man, I don't think he is a dead one. Too bad the one actor who most looked the part, the freckle-faced, tow-headed Walter Cunningham, did not also sound it.Perhaps it is the experience of watching the movie so soon after having read the book.

I picked up on a sullen, mocking reluctance in scenes requiring a demonstration of affection and lovingness. Alford, more down-home, does just fine, and is all boy, with a lovely voice. Dill is hardly anyone's notion of a beautiful child contest winner and is clearly not Southern. Peck certainly looks the part of Atticus Finch, and while Atticus clearly is a reserved man, I don't think he is a dead one. Too bad the one actor who most looked the part, the freckle-faced, tow-headed Walter Cunningham, did not also sound it.Perhaps it is the experience of watching the movie so soon after having read the book. There simply is no comparison. Read the book! It is so much better. ","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"28 January 2009","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" In the 2001 heist flick, The Score, Robert De Niro, Edward Norton and Marlon Brando -- three respected actors separated only be generations -- join forces for the first and last time to create a cast that often supersedes the movie they are in. Directed by Frank Yoda Oz, it's a slow-burning, yet stylish and classy movie that works well with a well-worn formula. Robert De Niro plays a seasoned thief\/nightclub owner set to retire from the lifestyle and live it up with his girlfriend (Angela Bassett), but not before completing one last job. Set up by his long-time partner in crime (Marlon Brando), he must join forces with a young and cocky criminal (Edward Norton) on what proves to be a very difficult and problematic job.Sure, the plot has been done to death in other films, but it's the actors and the cinematography that carry the film. It may not be jam-packed full of surprises, but for the two hours the movie takes to get to it's point, it never loses any steam. All three actors -- and even Bassett, who is given limited screen-time -- are on fire. De Niro plays the part naturally, as always, while Brando is a blast, obviously having fun with the role and responsible for lightening the load from time to time. Edward Norton, as always, chats up and chews up the scenery in a role that is marginally over-shadowed by his older counterparts. The direction by Frank Oz -- who has directed a few duds in his time -- is surprising stylish and accomplished. Less about action and more about suspense and character development, The Score doesn't break any new ground. Rather, it's a classic story delivered with a phenomenal cast and a good visual sense. Worth watching if for nothing else than to see three legends doing what they do best in one film.

Even though he didn't do much acting (for being a robot and all) he managed to pull his character, would i say perfectly If you haven't seen this yet i highly recommend it to everyone (but not little children off course).
