To wrap up the premise, it is definitely a love story, but it is much much more. The film features two stories of love... one is Count Almasy's passionate affair with his colleague's wife Katharine, shown in flashback; and the other, set in the story's present, is between Kip the Sikh bomb disposal expert and Hana the French-Canadian nurse who took care of Almasy after a deadly injury in WWII. While the central story revolves around Almasy's painful memories, it also contrasts his and Hana's experiences with love with a haunting style.The character of Almasy gives a golden chance to any actor. His plane got shot down in the Sahara and he was taken to Italy severely burnt, injured, and crippled, with an acute memory loss. He was put to an abandoned house with Hana to take care of him. As Hana read some part from the book he possessed, his memories kept coming back to him... memories of a passionate yet futile relationship. And yet he was surely going to die, his only motivation to live was to get the memory of the that love's fate back. Ralph Fiennes gives perhaps his career-best performance as Almasy. He portrays Almasy as a glum yet romantic man who himself never thought his capability to love someone could be so deep. His take on the burnt-faced, crippled Almasy is equally fascinating. He certainly deserved his Academy nomination.Hana is an extremely good natured woman, yet her own experiences with love had been also painful until she meets the Army bomb expert Kip Singh (played excellently by Naveen Andrews). She gets fascinated by his original romanticism and subsequently worries if he will also face the same fate as her previous lovers. Her relationship to Almasy is nothing extraordinary as such, but there remained a bond between them, formed by their choices and nature of love. Juliette Binoché won Oscar for this role and that sums up how she acted. She portrays Hana as one who's optimistic in the outside but bears a strange frustration and pain about love deep inside. Two contrasting scenes one, when she plays at the yard in the evening and two, when she rides the bicycle up to the bridge to see if Kip's alright.All the other actors were also great. Willem Dafoe gives a very realistic performance as the Canadian war victim with a hidden agenda. Kristin Scott Thomas perhaps, in my opinion, was not the best choice for the role of Katharine but what she did was magical. Colin Firth was also nice to watch as her husband.As a director Minghella is definitely breathtaking. Instead of discussing his style, I would only mention some scenes from the movie which remained unforgettable. One, the sandstorm; two, the scene where Almasy first courts Katharine; three, the first verbal exchange between Almasy and Caravaggio; four, where Kip shows Hana the paintings at the church... I see I can go on and on. Minghella also brings out a magnificent screenplay with some memorable quotes.The English Patient is a movie rich with every ingredient a serious film should have -- cinematography, original music, make-up, good script and of course, acting. Although it may seem a bit slow it is not boring, rather this slowness is one of its gifts.

Though I really wished it wasn't Tom Hanks who played Mike Sullivan. His steely hit-man look is achieved by furrowing his eyebrows. Should I be convinced that this is the look of a guy who's been killing people all his life? Let's face it. Tom Hanks make his characters likable. That's his thing, his gift. And it was totally wrong for this movie. This movie should have been like dark chocolate--bitter, dark, mysterious, with a tinge of sweetness. Instead, with casting of Tom Hanks, it became a milk chocolate--with a biteful of aluminum wrapper on the teeth to go with it.Otherwise, it was quite good in many aspects. The camera work is done beautifully--the way scenes flow, it's difficult to remain unimpressed. There is also one striking scene which everything that happens is seen through between Mike Sullivan's two feet. The look of the film, created by the use of light and shadows, dark and neutral color tones, are visually satisfying. The score is quite good, although it doesn't quite hit the mark in some scenes. The main score is one of my favorites in film.Good supporting cast--Paul Newman was great as the crime boss. Jude Law plays a slimy, balding hit-man with a taste for taking photos of those recently deceased from violent crimes.As for the other main character, the kid playing the son did a decent job. He does not overdo his part, for which I'm quite glad.The story does leave something to be desired. Predictable and hackneyed plot, with pretty weak story development. I have not read the original source material from which this film is based on, but I understand that the film took quite a few liberties with the plot anyway, so you can't really blame the book. But it's not really that bad, especially when you take the whole movie as a package.Just as a side note--keeping in line with the title of the film, it would have been better if the final twist on who killed who did not happen. After all, the kid learned more about his father in those six weeks they spent together than he has ever before--and during those six weeks, all that the father was concerned about was revenge. Not the welfare of his son, but revenge for done deeds. What a lesson for the kid. If the movie was truly about father-son relationships, it would make much more sense to continue the cycle of violence.Bottomline, it was a high 7. Satisfying, solid film.

Think of all the Billy Wilder comedies, like Some like it Hot and The Apartment, great movies, with sharp, intelligent scripts and a stylish direction. But still, in a film like those, one laughs, but nothing more. There is no deep emotion, no symbolism, no major theme or thematology, and no thinking. In a sense, the only thing that makes us like those movies is the use of humor. Now, when it comes to Dr. Strangelove. What is it that elevates this film from all other comedies it is not humor, it is wit. Never before have I watched a comedy where I am required to think as well. What I loved about this movie was the little details, the names, for example. Although I love 2001, ACO, Barry Lyndon and Paths of Glory, I think that DrS is the best Kubrick movie ever! Not only the brilliant, flawless script, of so many unexpected twists and turns, but the lovely satirical direction. Every aspect of this film has a humorous symbolic nature, such as the title sequence, with the two planes exchanging fluids. But one can't only view a film, and particularly this film, and like it as it is. One has to consider the time-frame in which it was made. In an era of desperation and general fear of a third world war, Kubrick dared to make fun of it all, reminding people to take it easy, and love the bomb.

In making movies, and, evidently, watching them, I discovered that such pure emotions as cry, laugh, fright, are quite easy to create. Comedies are made to make us laugh. Think of all the Billy Wilder comedies, like Some like it Hot and The Apartment, great movies, with sharp, intelligent scripts and a stylish direction. But still, in a film like those, one laughs, but nothing more. There is no deep emotion, no symbolism, no major theme or thematology, and no thinking.

As long as they are at least somewhat original - which sometimes seems harder to find than you would like to believe - I really can have a good time with them. But for some reason I feared that this movie wouldn't belong to that category and that's why it took me almost ten years to finally watch it. Now that I did, I know that I shouldn't have waited that long.Lucy is already in love with Peter for a very long time. The only problem is that she has never really spoken to him and that he probably doesn't even know of her existence. He's a commuter to who she sells a ticket for the metro every day. When on Christmas Day he's attacked by some muggers, he falls on the rails and lies there unconscious. Lucy doesn't hesitate, but immediately goes after him and saves him from the oncoming train. Then he goes into a coma and is transported to hospital. And that's where all the problems start. The hospital staff confuses her for his fiancée, which they also tell to his family. They immediately welcome her into the family and Lucy, who isn't used to so much family happiness and warmth, isn't able to tell them that she and Peter haven't got a relationship. To make things even more complicated for her, Peter's brother falls in love with her and when Peter himself wakes up, he too believes that she is his fiancée...Even though the story feels a bit like all other romantic comedies, I must say that I like the new approach of a man in coma as the subject of affection. Even though he plays a very important role in this movie, his performance only consists of lying there with his eyes closed. And somehow that feels more OK than seeing yet another clumsy guy who is able to win the heart of the woman of his dreams. But not only the story is OK, so is the acting. Sandra Bullock, Jack Warden, Bill Pullman,... were nice to watch and even though Peter Gallagher didn't really have a difficult part, he too did a good job.I guess the only 'problem' that I had with this movie was that it was situated during Christmas time, while I saw it in the beginning of September. I'm not saying that I wasn't able to get completely involved in it, but somehow it felt a bit weird to see snow and to see them decorate the Christmas tree. That's also the reason why I believe that this is a perfect movie to play in that time period instead of THE Christmas classic The Sound of Music. You're already completely in the right mood then and I'm sure that such a movie would only add to that perfect feeling of family happiness. But than again, it's not that you can't watch this movie on another day either.All in all this is one of the better romantic comedies that I've seen lately. I had some good laughs with it, the romance was a bit weird but believable, the acting was good and the story original. What more can you expect from such a movie.

First off, there wasn't a realistic,sympathetic character in the whole movie. Please don't assume this is because i don't get it. I was a teen once, and it was the worst part of my life, like most people. I love Catcher in the Rye, because it had a protagonist who could voice his feelings of isolation and cynicism. I can relate to this. The protagonist of Harold and Maude is a cipher, an emotional void. I know that was the point, but if you're going to have the protagonist be an empty shell of a person, you better show us why. Hal Ashby shouldn't just rely on the fact that we were all teens once, and leave it at that. And have some interesting supporting characters at least, to counteract Harold! Actually, this was provided for in the script as the elderly Maude, who was supposed to represent the opposite of Harold, meaning by this films logic she had to radiate vibrancy and love life to no end. But something went terribly wrong in the writing\/acting process. Maude felt like such a false character to me, such an abstraction. In nearly every scene she's in, she's smiling maniacally for no apparent reason. After initially feeling fear at this character's unrestrained looney projection of happiness, I reasoned to myself that her mania would be explained as an effect of drugs or psychosis. This didn't happen, and I'm still wondering who the hell would think any sane person could be so constantly, furiously happy! Oh, a sad past is barely hinted at in a last minute attempt at dimension(that Holocaust reference was totally non-sequitor and pointless) but rather than explain her inhuman joy it made Maude appear even more creepy and repressed..She is clearly a literary conceit created to match the equally false,over the top pessimism of Harold.Oh and speaking of Harold, his suicide attempts were milked for laughs far too many times. Granted, the first couple of times, it was shocking and funny. But the fact that they needed to repeat this gag about thirty times really showcases the creative bankruptcy of this film. I wouldn't even object to this gimmick(It might have worked as screwball comedy)if this movie wasn't so self-serious and sentimental about its message. I'm wildly guessing it has to do with being yourself not matter what anyone says and don't criticize other lifestyles.But the most grievous flaw to this film (besides its pedantic nature and detestable characters) is the fact that it betrays its message.It is hypocritical, and yes mean-spirited. Look at what his mother has to go through everyday! But I never thought of this while watching the film, because the film makes the mother a cold robot incapable of feeling any compassion whatsoever. She deserves to be f-ed with, this film argues in its subtext, just like the general does and the cop. Basically anyone in Harolds universe besides Maude. Why? Because they are rich buorgoise or establishment who don't understand Harold. And what about Sunshine, who seemed genuinely interested in Harold and didn't fall for his misanthropic pranks? I genuinely thought this film would provide a crumb of insight at the 11th hour and have some compassion(for anyone besides H and M) at this point by having Harold be interested in this girl. But no, she is tossed aside at this point in the script like so much garbage.Look, I'm all for skewering the upper-class, Luis Bunuel is my favorite director and his films are filled with contempt towards not only the upper-class, but conformity as well. But if you're going to properly attack or satirize any group, you must first portray them as at least faintly human and only then accentuate their human flaws.

Basically French nuclear tests have been going on in the Pacific Ocean, and it was observed by marine iguanas, so obviously the radiation has fused with one of these lizards to create a monster that first attacks Japan. Dr. Niko 'Nick' Tatopoulos (Matthew Broderick) is investigating a giant footprint found on the border of New York City, and soon enough this large dinosaur like creature, Godzilla, rages through the skyscrapers to terrorise the people. They know that Godzilla is fulfilling some kind of need, so they decide to lure the monster back and plan their attack to pile a mountain of fish in the middle of a road, and then fire at the creature, but this plan doesn't work very well. Nick comes to the conclusion that Godzilla is asexual, which means that he\/she will give birth to other babies that will also be pregnant and reproduce rapidly, but they supposedly manage to kill Godzilla on its way back to the ocean. Nick, French Secret Service agent Philippe Roaché (Jean Reno), Nick's ex-girlfriend and aspiring journalist Audrey Timmonds (Razzie winning Maria Pitillo) and cameraman Victor 'Animal' Palotti (The Simpsons' Hank Azaria) manage to find the nest in Madison Square Garden. The hundreds of eggs hatch and the baby Godzilla chase them, as they smell of fish, so they rush upstairs and try to get away from the creatures, and they manage to find a news casting room to give out a warning. The armed forces send out bomber planes to destroy the building, and all the babies are killed in the wreckage, but then all of the sudden Godzilla crashes through the floor and has returned, and it wants revenge for the death of her offspring. While trapped in a tunnel, Nick works out a way to possibly get the opportunity to attack Godzilla, by trapping the monster in a suspension bridge, so they head for Brooklyn Bridge, and it does indeed end up trapped in the suspension cables. It ends with Godzilla attacked by missiles and killed, Nick and Audrey possibly back together, and Roaché disappearing with Animal's camera footage of the monsters, but of course it returns to the wreckage of Madison Square Garden, where one egg remains and hatches.

The cast are I guess fine, but it is obvious most attention is drawn to the monster, using some pretty alright special effects to create the roaring beast and the buildings being destroyed, I think the most memorable sequence is the characters chased in the building by the babies. I can see however why the critics give it two stars out of five, it is not all that scary or thrilling like the original version, and it does at times feel very cheesy, but if you do like an easy watch with some fun action and a fair amount of destruction then I guess this isn't terrible, a sometimes dreary but relatively alright monster horror disaster movie.

The original play--and the countless high school or community theatre revivals--took place on a spare stage, but that was perhaps a little too adventurous for Hollywood in 1940.

I remember being stopped in my tracks by the tool the milkman uses to apportion out the milk (cream?) to his customers a kind of tubular shovel that allowed him to fill up their own containers and still give an equal amount to all. How on earth did Menzies know about such things? Was it his own memories he drew upon? Some have said that Thornton Wilder might have been horrified by the changes that were wrought in his work. It would be instructive for those people to consult the American Film Institute Catalog for this film. In the notes, the editors remark that no changes were made without Wilder's permission.

I used to look at my parents' yearbooks all the time. Those teenagers looked ancient. There was no culture of youth, no worship of childishness then the way there is today. Their goal was to grow up as soon as possible, and they worked hard all through their adolescence and teenage years. For me, seeing the baby-face of William Holden, looking almost unrecognizably young, the last thing I thought of was whether he looked too *old* for his part!

Here, however, the muddled storyline is too ordinary or to put it another way, the Coens seem to want some kind of mainstream acceptance that has otherwise not been their goal before. The cast does well in their respective roles but there is something too familiar about the whole set up. Yes, there were a lot of rural dramas in the 30's and 40's but the Coens seem too much in love with these movies to satirize them. That means that it is more of an homage than reinterpretation and that's a shame because they had so good luck with their ode to screwball comedy The Hudsucker Proxy. All the Coens' favorites are here including John Goodman, John Turturro and Holly Hunter but most of the time is wasted on crass southern stereotypes and to make fun of them is acceptable but it's annoying to see it for the umpteenth time. The best thing about this is the tinted photography which gives the film a worn out look that goes great with the rural setting.

So tired of watching homogenized films about stealing the groom from the bride; cheating on the bride-to-be while on a road-trip in wine country; the sad\/depressed bridesmaid\/maid-of-honor tragically gets dumped by her escort; blah-blah-blah. What this film offers us instead is something in the eyes of four Af-Am buddies who get together before one of them ties the knot. And there are no race cards pulled. The film does not zero on one of the characters and their drug\/alcohol problem, or gang-related problemos, or any stereotypical stuff like that. No- what Malcolm Lee did instead was deliver us with an ensemble cast who just happen to be black, mix in a smooth R & B soundtrack with it and a give us a fun premise.It's simple Harper (Diggs) is on the brink of publishing his first novel with characters loosely based on his friends from college. He flies to New York to get together with his buddies before attending his friend's wedding. During that time, he encounters an old flame that got away; the changes in ideology and values with others. But on the night of the bachelor party, Lance (Chestnut) gets his paws on a copy and reads it, puzzling together the composites while blaming Diggs for cheating with his fiancée.Taye Diggs, Nia Long, Morris Chestnut, Terrence Dashon Howard, Harold Perrineau, Monica Calhoun, Sanaa Lathan, and the rest of all the cast get the fattest props because without their acting, this would've been a train wreck. What makes these characters so unique and human is that they're not stereotypical caricature's and each of them all evolve their own style. Taye Diggs is the quiet pragmatist of them all, yet he's no dork. Morris Chestnut is Lance the football player\/groom-to-be. Harold Perrineau is the hopelessly, pathetically whipped brother-man with heart and Terrence Dashon Howard (from this year's Crash)steals every scene he's in as the cynical but cool cat musician buddy. Nia Long is the former flame of Taye Diggs with Sanaa Lathan as his girlfriend.Yeah, the story is a little predictable. Yeah, it's a little lewd and sexist (the scene at the poker table, but I love those lines Bite it!, Grow it!). The very ending is something we've seen before, yet it's funny anyway. Only problem was that this film was probably labeled as a black film at the time and that was probably why it received such poor box office (a'la Waiting to Exhale, Boomerang). Perhaps Hollywood wasn't ready to see that and preferred a movie about a suburban, white, dysfunctional family instead. Oh, and gave it Best Picture, too.

Marky Mark, however, was a disaster. He has absolutely ZERO on-screen presence, he can't act well enough to even convince me that he is a human being, much less a astronaut, and the movie suffered badly because of this. I didn't care about his lead character, I had no idea what was going on in his head at any time, he never showed fear, anger, happiness, or any of the myriad emotions that most real people have. It was truly awful. Charleton Heston may have overacted in the 1968 version of this movie, but at least you could associate the word act with his performance. And Charleton had the on-screen presence that was so lacking in this version.Others have mentioned some of the various plot problems, including the ending, so I won't go into them except to say they are there and they make a number of plot events implausible. I would also like to point out that, once again (just as in the original POTA), the presence of horses on this planet is yet another obvious plot problem.As a straightforward action film the movie is pretty decent. The ape makeup and the ape movement is pretty damn good.Overall, I was considerably disappointed in this version of Planet of the Apes It had no originality, they chose the wrong leading actor, and the plot had huge holes. If you want to experience Planet of the Apes rent the original...it's so much better that there isn't really any comparison (except for the title).

Does this movie make too much use of violence. When it first came it brought up a lot of debate. Some refused to show it because of it's violence. When I saw it, I wasn't shocked by it and I found that frightening. However, it made me start to think about the world we're living in and the power the media has to affect peoples meanings and opinions. This movie is one of the most anti-violent movies I have ever seen. Some say it is just violent, but I clearly see a anti-violent message in there along with criticism of the media making heroes without thinking about the consequences first. While some action movies got you all worked up with all the shooting and heroes this movie just makes you sit there and think What the...?. It may not rise as much debate today, as we are getting used to more violence, but it certainly opens you're eyes and it's criticism of the media is now probably even more topical then it's ever been.I think Oliver Stone did this Tarrantino story very good. On the other hand there was some elements I found confusing and effects I didn't quite get the meaning of. However, this is one of them movies you can watch several times and still see something new each time. This is probably not the last time I've seen it.The acting is great. There is really not much more to say. The casting did a good job finding the right actors for the roles and the actors deliver.The cinematography is also very nice done. There are no boring or unnecessary shots and the lightning is just magical. The change between color and black and white is also nice. You notice it at the beginning, but then the you don't notice if the color is changed from green to red. It all just seems natural and right at the moment. It's the same with the sound. You notice some songs, but mostly it's just there creating the atmosphere just as it should.This is a movie everyone should see.
