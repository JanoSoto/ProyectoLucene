[{"date":"23 August 2008","score":"","review":" Frank Capra's 1934 film It Happened One Night paved the way for many copycats; even the soap opera General Hospital had a story arc that involved a runaway - bridegroom this time - and those famous Walls of Jericho. Not only that, but it changed the undershirt industry and inspired a famous bunny pose.The story takes place during the Depression, when hitchhiking was common. It concerns an heiress, Ellie (Claudette Colbert) who runs away from her father to join her sort-of husband in New York. On the bus, she meets a reporter named Peter (Clark Gable) who is down on his luck. The strike a bargain Peter can have an exclusive on Ellie's story if he'll help her get to New York.Though many actors turned down the lead roles, the combination of Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert is perfect. Gable is appropriately a gruff know-it-all with oodles of sex appeal; Colbert is beautiful, spoiled and uppity. My favorite moment is when she coolly informs the bus driver that she's leaving so hold the bus for her.Any even peripheral fan of the film has heard that when Gable undressed and was wearing no undershirt, sales of undershirts plummeted. Perhaps a little less well known is that Gable's standing by a fence talking with a carrot in his mouth is allegedly the inspiration for Bugs Bunny. The most famous scene, of course, is Gable demonstrating how to hitch a ride and failing and Colbert lifting her skirt to get one immediately.Frank Capra is known for his feel good, idealistic films, but there was much more to this director than that, as It Happened One Night demonstrates. He gives the film a wonderful pace and gets marvelous performers out of his cast, which includes Walter Connolly as Ellie's father, Roscoe Karns, Alan Hale and Ward Bond. It's a comedy, but Capra shades it with earmarks of the Depression. A slice of life in the 1930s, a wonderful comedy - well, in the end, it's a feel good film after all.
