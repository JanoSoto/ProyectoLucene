So let's get the film's controversy out of the way Is it wrong for a white person like Mark Watson (C. Thomas Howell) to disguise himself as a black person? In most cases, yes. Is it wrong to do so to obtain a scholarship? In all cases, double yes. Does it make a bad idea for a movie? Not necessarily.The problem with Soul Man is not so much its premise as much as its execution. You have a white college student, Mark, from L.A. who learns that he and his friend Gordon (Arye Gross) have been accepted into Harvard Law School. The only problem is that even though he comes from a well-to-do family, his father decides not to support him financially. Mark tries every way to pay for his tuition and living expenses, including applying for financial aid, for which he is immediately turned down. I'm not so sure if that would happen in real life, but then again, I haven't applied to law school. Plus, anyone can apply for student loans, right? Regardless, Mark eventually comes across Harvard's only viable full-ride scholarship he can find, which happens to be solely for African-American students. In a fraudulent and risky move, he decides to turn himself black. He does so by taking tanning pills that increase the melanin in his skin, and dons a Jheri curl.There are two problems with this transformation 1.) Howell does not look African-American at all when he darkens his skin. In fact, I thought he looked like an Indian-American with a really bad hair stylist. Yet, in this movie, no character seems to think for a second that this guy isn't black, not even Harvard Professor Banks (James Earl Jones), who seems way too educated to be fooled.2.) Most importantly, you never actually see Mark Watson come to the conclusion that posing as a black man is a good idea. The film just suddenly jump cuts from his vain attempts to seek financial support to his racial transformation, all with no explanation whatsoever. I wanted to see him take those pills and at least get an idea of what was going through his head. Also, why did he decide on a Jheri curl as a haircut? I would imagine that a Jheri curl, which already requires an ozone-killing amount of hair spray as it is, would be more difficult to maintain than simply shaving his head. John Howard Griffin employed the latter hairstyle choice while doing research for the novel Black Like Me.I could go on about the character weaknesses of Mark Watson, such as the fact that he doesn't seem smart enough to mop the floors of Harvard Law School let alone be a student there, nor does he have the motivation. He made the dumb decision to attend Professor Banks' criminal law class simply because Professor Banks was a brother. He doesn't seem to register how intimidating James Earl Jones is as a Harvard professor, whereas I got the impression immediately as Jones was taking attendance in his first scene.It's not C. Thomas Howell's fault that the Mark Watson character is the way he is, although his career suffered because of it. It's just that Mark should have been developed more, and not just be made a carbon copy of a member of the Delta Tau Chi frat in Animal House (1978). If Arye Gross's character was made that way, that's fine, but making both characters inept really ruins the base of the story.Otherwise, I actually liked the parts of the film where Mark begins to realize that racism is not something that just died after the 1960's. He does say at one point that, This (the 1980's) is the Cosby decade! America loves black people! Well, not so much. While racism is not as obvious as it was before the Civil Rights Movement, it's still alive and well even in liberal Massachusetts.I liked how Howell gets fazed little by little over two white classmates who like telling racists jokes to one another. I also thought his time in jail with unruly white disgruntled baseball players was stinging enough. The basketball montage (featuring Ronald Reagan's son, Ron Reagan) was also very funny.I thought most of the supporting actors were convincing. Rae Dawn Chong was charming as ever, although her career also fizzled after this movie for some reason. Leslie Nielsen was also good as Mr. Dunbar, a building superintendent who does not take kindly to his beautiful daughter's (Melora Hardin) attraction to black Mark. The scene when he envisions Mark as a watermelon-eating pimp who shouts Whatchu lookin' at!?! was biting, but funny.The fact that all these characters, black or white, were fooled by Mark being a black man is still what contributed to this movie's lack of credibility. Apparently also, not everyone was laughing at this movie either. Spike Lee and Eddie Murphy publicly denounced it. Then again, though, Richard Pryor reportedly found it funny.Films about characters who make bad choices are not necessarily bad choices for movie plots. This wasn't a bad idea for a movie, but it could have been stronger if vital pieces of exhibition were not skimmed over haphazardly. What results is a film that is not black or white, but too gray.

They often rely on the audience gaining some sort of emotional investment out of seeing an adorable baby character, or young toddler, that says lines that no young kid would say, and the usual reaction is Aaawwww! (Full House did this for years). These types of cinema have no reason for existence, and usually try to serve as cheap entertainment that families can enjoy together. This movie is chalk full of little children doing things children would never do, no doubt with the director feeding them lines that they don't understand because they can't read yet. But, where this film is different is it's set up. The universe that these little rascals live in isn't the one we live in. It's some kind of parallel universe where children own their own cars and have very elaborate clubhouses, and where very young children go on romantic dates. And never once is this particularly corny. What could be a by the numbers movie turns out to be a sort of charming little movie that is fun and funny in a surreal way.Little Alfalfa (Bug Hall) is in a group of girl-hating little boys, and they find out about his upcoming romantic date with Darla (Brittany Ashton Holmes), and they sabotage him. Meanwhile a new rich kid Waldo (Blake Ewing) has just moved in and Darla finds him quite appealing, so Alfalfa is down in the dumps. Hopefully the up-coming go-cart race is a chance for Alfalfa to get his lady back, in addition to beat Waldo, and bond with his child pal Spanky (Travis Tedford).This kids in this movie are actually all really good actors, and that's one thing that makes this movie work. Bug Hall is one of the better young actors out there, and all the ridiculous silly lines that the kids say (though kids clearly wouldn't say in real life) are said with enough conviction, yet with a clear wink from the director and writer(s). The kids say their lines well, but with a slightly over the top script, and the mixture comes off as pretty funny. The film runs at a brisk pace, with enough jokes to make up for it's overall lack of plot. The sets would have to be pretty cool looking to a child (at least they were to me!). The clubhouse that the kids built is designed to look like it was built by kids, but at the same time, it's so surreally elaborate. And this movie has plenty of surrealism and absurdest humor. Things will happen that make very little sense, but come off as hilarious because of how ridiculous the situation is. In one scene during the big race at the end, giant daggers come out of a kid's car and start stabbing another car. It's so ridiculous, but in the context of the movie, it comes off as normal in this universe, and jokes like this that might normally seem very over the top, play off quite well. If anything was unnecessary here, it was the numerous cameos that usually show up for no reason at all. A few of them were funny, but most of them seemed somewhat forced. Kids probably won't know who most of these people are anyways, so they won't understand that these are cameos.Overall, this is a very enjoyable family film, with good performances (from kids no less), and a lot of really silly jokes that hit the mark. In an average episode of Full House, I probably cringe about 10 times, but in this much longer film featuring even more kids including cameos by the Olsen Twins, there was not one moment of cringing. It's actually pretty fun.My rating *** out of ****. 82 mins. PG for some rude humor.

And I remember it was a dark, cold night... And I couldn't wait to see Batman Forever! Me, little kid back then, very thrilled, anything could please me! I remember waiting in front of the cinema, freezing my ass of, waiting to get inside and get me a little bat-bliss. Then it goes... lights out, it's warm, me and my family, thrilling Eliot Goldenthal's score, roles... and then goes a wild action, neon lights... lively characters, hot lady, annoying partner, explosions, two hot chicks... new kind of image of dark knight. Wow! I was happy and excited... and thinking to myself... what a cool film.Than... YOU GROW UP!!!! And you start to have toughts... and world is real and different to you...2011... saw this film again, well I have seen it many times before, since I have it in my film collection. And I am still thinking to myself, being a Batman fan... what a hell did I just watch? Tim Burton, the man who set this wonderful franchise for us... he gave us an amazing picture of Batman... just that Joel Schumacher (spawn of Satan) can ruin it for us! The fact is that Joel didn't even read the comic books, he just took characters and put them in this terrible world of neon lights... in this bitchy colored world... this terrible looking Gotham City, perhaps the worst version of Gotham City I have ever seen. Too much lights, damn it! This film is for kids and kids only! Joel rather watched those campy old Adam West TV series and he was like let's put it in 95... let's see how it goes... it goes bad! Schumacher ruined everything about Batman, about the character, comic book and the franchise. Lee Batchler who created a story... die, man! The most childish story ever! Akiva Goldsman, I wonder... how come that Bob Kane didn't kill that pr..k! How come that Bob Kane didn't get a heart attack during filming... Jesus! This is one happy, merry version of Batman for dumb kids and people who definitely can't use their intelligence in proper way, or for people that don't have a taste for something better.Let's begin with the characters and actors and their credit for this. Val Kilmer... visually not Bruce Wayne at all, he is good actor, but not good as Bruce Wayne or Batman... those lips of his, disgusting! But, his voice was cool. Tommy Lee Jones... well... Jones is a great actor! Amazing actor! And he really did good, over the top acting here. He amazed me from time to time... but he missed the character! He based Two Face upon Jack Nicholson's Joker! Two-Face is supposed be calm, psychotic, cold blooded death bringer... a real life grim reaper with a coin to toss, if you like... Jones ruined character here forever! Jim Carey as Riddler... don't know about that choice, Carey was pretty powerful back then as a comic actor and this was a mistake to cast him. He was funny, yes, I was amazed on his performance too, but... not a real Riddler. Riddler is also a cold, calm mastermind. Ruined! Nicole Kidman... well, nothing but smoking hot chick shrink who is interested in dark knight... blonde hair, full, red lips, dark clothes, black stockings... 90s were really hot! And Kidman was extremely hot back then. And of course Chris O'Donell... what to say about this little no talented little bastard... that little sonuvabitch! The little guy can't act, can't do anything! Really unnecessary character! Annoying and dumb! Takes away your time and plot! Now, for some other things... we have pretty weird, so called neon gangs... what a hell is that... that's mental! Batmobile? The first Batmobile model... upgraded with stupid lights... no, wait.. it's ruined! The only thing I like about this film is Eliot Goldenthal's score. The guy is brilliant. No matter how the music sounds, I think he is the only one who was serious during his film. Love the score. A fine replacement for Danny Elfman. And of course... Alfred. Michael Gough... may he rest in peace, I think that he was the best Alfred. He has this old, gentleman posture, astringent eyes, but resonant and soft voice.And for the end... one more thing. Why the f..k is everybody traumatized with nipples on Batman's costume?! Joel Schumacher, being known as openly gay, he stated that the movie costume desingers wanted to give more anatomic look to the costume... by who's orders... hmm? I don't understand why is everybody disturbed? What a hell do you think this is? Superbowl?!??! Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake?!?!? What a hell?! People say - that's gay! Well... poor hell... I think that people who noticed nipples on Batman costume are gay! Nothing but a pseudo aggressive male a-holes that notices small things that makes you think that's gay... and now the world is going to be destroyed because of the nipples on Batman's costume! People can't concentrate on something far more important than nipples... f@@k nipples!!! Damn it...Anyhow... I don't recommend this film, unless you are a 4 year old kid... But, if you are a fan ready to watch it again... squeeze your fists and teeth and endure that ordeal! Good luck!

We can't go back to 1950s Rome. Or 1950s Hollywood. The alluring city of Rome is a wonderful setting for the film. It's Rome as we'd like to remember it, a Rome that in many ways doesn't exist anymore. Life was just different back then. Simpler, probably happier, definitely more charming. The movie is also the product of a Hollywood that no longer exists. This is a movie with a very definite 1950s style and feel. Unfortunately that 1950s style doesn't always translate for the modern viewer. It was a simpler time in movie-making as well as life but this film is perhaps a little too simple for modern tastes. The plot is threadbare. The movie doesn't have much energy to it. It's all very relaxed. Too relaxed. For whatever charms the movie has it just isn't entertaining enough. There's just not enough going on.Aside from the wonderful 1950s time capsule look at Rome the film has one other thing clearly working in its favor. Audrey Hepburn. In this, her first major role, Hepburn is relentlessly charming. It's so easy to see why she would go on to become one of the world's most beloved stars. But all her charms aren't quite enough to overcome the problems with the story. The central problem being that there isn't enough of a story at all. Hepburn plays Ann, princess of an unspecified European country. She's on a grand tour of Europe, appearing before teeming crowds of thousands everywhere she goes. She is obviously a quite notably famous person. Which makes the fact that she goes completely unrecognized by anyone when she slips away from her royal duties to wander the streets of Rome more than a little hard to believe. Even the supposedly astute reporter who will become her companion on her little getaway has no idea who she is until he sees her picture in the paper. Mind you, this guy was supposed to be interviewing the princess that very day. Is he really that much of a dunce? And then this story, hard to believe as it is, just kind of sits there. This is a movie which could really use some bursts of energy to drive it forward.The story of a princess who longs to be a regular woman, to get out there and live and love a little, has its possibilities. But this movie doesn't do enough with its story. And for a movie billed as a romantic comedy the laughs are very few and far between. Hepburn is terrific, no quibbles with anything she does. You just wish the movie gave her the chance to do more. Hepburn's co-star Gregory Peck comes across as a little wooden and unnatural. He's a Hollywood legend in his own right but there's no doubt that in this film it is Hepburn's star which shines much brighter. Peck's character of reporter Joe Bradley is so bland you wonder how the princess could possibly find herself falling for him. Maybe after leading such a sheltered life she's just so grateful to have the chance to fall for anybody. But the romance never really rings true. At least there's Joe's photographer friend Irving to inject some personality into the proceedings. Irving, as portrayed by Eddie Albert, has got a little life to him. But that's just a supporting part. If the main character of Joe doesn't work, which it really doesn't, the movie suffers. It's easy to understand why Roman Holiday was so acclaimed and generally loved upon its initial release. It has some things going for it, the wonderful Hepburn first and foremost. But it's a movie with a style which suits the era in which it was made, not playing nearly as well today. Not a bad movie but not notably better than average either. For as much as Hepburn may charm you the movie does not do enough to entertain you.

At the end, Leo walks away from Tom, at Miller's Crossing ...And that is the summum bonum of the entire film ... the slow turning of the tables. The entire experience remains unforgettable even for the unpredictability and ambivalence Byrne brings to his portrayal of Tom Regan, imbuing the character with an underlying menace which pervades his portrayal throughout, so that his query, towards the memorable close of the film, What heart? assumes a significance all its own. Though John Turturro's turn as the homosexual Bernie Bernbaum is often touted as the star performance in the film, I myself was not so enthralled by it; the character appears to me to be a bit sketchily drawn, with some gaps remaining to be filled in. And Turturro, in my view, pitches his act just a wee bit overboard, so that it does not remain entirely credible.No ... The film, in my view, belongs to Byrne and Byrne alone. Further, it is also memorable because it essentially abandons the usual bullets-and-bloodshed formula which most gangster epics adopt, and concentrates on the psychological aspect of the whole thing ... it's a fascinating exercise in mindplay and, perhaps for that very reason, is intellectually draining as well.What was going on in Tom's mind at the end of it all?

To keep it, all they have to do is wait.A Simple Brilliant !.. what can i say, one of the best movies in the 90's, this film Reminds me of Fargo (Small town, Snow, crime, money and greed) The difference was on the plan and how the plan comes up Suddenly, the storyline in the film was excellent you wouldn't expect anything so there was many great scenes i will leave the rest for you to watch .Sam Raimi's direction is incredible, as is Scott Smith's script, really i didn't read the novel but i will soon, in the film i know there was a many changes but i'm really enthusiastic to read all Events .What makes this movie work is that it forces us to ask ourselves questions about our morality. Not everyone will like the ending. I think it is perfect.The Performances are universally excellent. Especially Billy Bob Thornton, who gives a truly great, and at times heartbreaking performance as a not very bright nor pretty middle-aged man that is doomed to life of loneliness.5\/5 ","genre":null},{"date":"9 September 2011","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Director by Sam Raimi Two brothers and a friend find $4 million in the cockpit of a downed plane.

One of only a small handful of comedies that I will watch repeatedly. As other reviewers have said, George young and old is great. It's a superb ensemble though.

Camryn Manheim's small but pivotal role always brings on a smile) I only gave it 9 stars, but that's because I'm a tough critic. It's a spectacularly good movie. It just isn't at that stratospheric ten level. IE Star Wars IV combined with being seven years old, or Clerks. If you haven't seen it yet, do so.

This, the British troupe's second cinematic expedition, is neither as carelessly silly as The Holy Grail nor as manic and sketch-heavy as The Meaning of Life, but it's every bit as funny in its own dryly sarcastic way. Though it might not be as immediately gratifying as its peers, I've come to appreciate Brian as the Pythons' best-written picture over the years, with a razor-sharp wit playing excellently alongside the requisite amounts of lunacy and brow-furrowing topics of conversation. And, though it's clearly a product of the late '70s in many ways, its not-so-subtle warnings against blind faith in any organization (or the men at the helm) is still very relevant in today's world. It isn't the non-stop jaunt through the funhouse that you might expect from this cast, yet Brian delivers no less efficiently in different ways, especially during its hilariously bleak song and dance finale.
