In the first 15-20 minutes it was not so badly done, but after that the story simply lost all dramatic suspense and conviction in a miserably failed attempt to turn an action film into some sort of artistic dance with overly-emphasized use of slow motion sequences. I have never in my life watched an action film with so many karate chops and gunshots and explosions, and so little suspense, so little thrill. Some of the characters, especially the key villain, were unconvincing and sort of not fully formed (the writers could take a few cues from the Bond movies), and director Woo seemed to think so highly of some of his inventions that he felt the need to repeat them over and over again (more than he should have to achieve the desired effect, e.g. the waves during the fight sequence at the end). The music was overdone and badly placed at times, too. By the end, the story (along with the suspense and drama) seemed to have lost all importance - it was like watching a really long music video with scenes from an action flick in it.

I really enjoyed The General overall, more than I thought I would as someone who was born after The Godfather.The main thing that surprised me was the fact that I couldn't look down to write very many notes; any time I took my eyes off the screen I ran a serious risk of missing something. It seems to me that the film, even though it was long (or seemed so), it was very dense in terms of action. I imagine that since the movie has no dialogue, the filmmakers must make up for it by making it as visually interesting and entertaining as possible. I am accustomed to more modern movies with snappy dialogue and special effects and such-movies in which you can look down at your popcorn or kiss your date and not miss too much because you can hear pretty much what's happening. This was a nice change for me.Obviously, I've never seen a Buster Keaton film, and I'm not even sure if I'd heard of him before this class. But I can see why he is so appealing in his films. I loved his facial expressions, particularly the stoic-but-crestfallen look in his eyes on the train when something else goes wrong. He also has great control of his body, as we discussed in class, and a fine sense of comic timing.I found the film surprisingly funny. Many modern films that I think are funny (e.g. Austin Powers, Toy Story, American Beauty) rely largely on witty or outrageous dialogue for their humor. As a silent film, The General must rely mainly on images for its humor-the slapstick images of Johnnie falling over constantly, the unusual image of Johnnie riding up and down on the crossbar between the train wheels, the stereotype exploitation in the scene when the girl sweeps out the locomotive. I'm sure that some of the things that I considered amusing might not have been considered funny by the original audience, such as the record-scratch lightning bolts.I really liked some of the cinematic techniques and blocking that Keaton used. One of my favorite scenes in the entire film is when Johnnie is chopping wood on the train while the Southern army retreats in the opposite direction in the background. Even though the `real' army is pulling back, the one they didn't want is rushing into enemy territory. It's a nice integration of plot and character commentary. I also liked the way he kept cutting back and forth between the Yankees on their trains and Johnnie on his, at first the pursuer, then the pursuee. By continually showing us what both sides are doing, Keaton builds the tension between them, adds to the comic effect, and keeps the audience interested by always giving them something different to look at. This montage technique is used in nearly all action films and many comedy films today.I did not realize that the rain and fire sound effects were added in later. I think they are interesting, and I can see why someone put them in, but I think I would prefer that the film be left the way it was originally shown. Or at least they should take out the chirping birds. Some people complained about the repetitiveness of the music, but I found the music quaint and very much in the character of the movie. It was as if each person or group had its own theme music, perhaps to make up for the lack of dialogue. The use of the `Beautiful Dreamer' love theme reminds me of the `Dreamweaver' love theme in Wayne's World that plays when Garth sees the blonde woman.Although the battle scene was interesting, I agreed with much of the class that the movie could have ended earlier. The movie seemed to change a bit once the entire army got involved and the focus left Johnnie for a time. Perhaps they could have ended the battle scene with the Southern army lying in wait for the enemy, and then cut to a later scene in which Johnnie receives an honorary enlistment so he can get the girl. But hey, then Keaton wouldn't have gotten to play with the bridge fire and the dam; maybe audiences then weren't so different from us, and would prefer an exciting ending for a movie like this over a more subdued one. But I still think it changed the character of the movie and should have been changed somehow.Overall I give it a 9\/10. If you've never seen a silent movie, this is a great one to start with.

The man is the master of action films (Face\/Off, The Killer, Hard Boiled). You can tell that Woo, Tom Cruise and the stuntmen worked hard to give the audience five great action sequences.  The motorcycle scene at the end was spectacular. Yet, all of the action scenes are linked to a very poorly executed love story and another killer virus plot.Cruise's Ethan Hunt falls in love with team member\/thief Nyah (Thandie Newton), but not one person in the theater could believe that these two people had fallen madly in love with each other after just meeting 24 hours ago. This is crucial because the movie revolves around their relationship. The plot about the killer virus is simple, but it would have worked if the love story was stronger. Woo needed to make the love story more believable and he failed. Hey, if we were all able to look across the room at someone and fall madly in love, then maybe we could believe this so-called love story.Thandie Newton's performance was horrible; she looked dazed and confused at the camera half the time and I wasn't sold that she was this tough, international thief either. Dougray Scott was a formidable and evil villain. He gave a very good performance. Having Anthony Hopkins in the movie, though he is a great actor,  was a waste of time and money. Don't go to see this movie just to see him. Actor Czerny Henry, who played IMF boss Eugene Kittridge in the first film, should have returned to play Hopkins' part and perhaps the filmmakers could have saved some money and hired a better lead actress.The movie had the Woo effect a slow-paced, moody feeling broken by fast-paced action sequences and special effects.  Cruise's portrayal of Ethan Hunt was different in this sequel than the original. In the first film, Hunt was confident in his abilities but was scared of what was lurking behind the corner. In this film, Woo and Cruise make Hunt a force to be reckoned with and feared. So, if you're a fan of Woo's action films and you want to see Cruise act like Chow-Yun Fat, then go see this movie.

Perhaps I am simply at the right time and place in my life to appreciate the movie's messages (I can imagine some people, especially younger viewers, not having the patience for its leisurely pace and plot), but I feel privileged to have shared in a little of the journey (both literal and figurative) of Farnsworth and Lynch's Alvin Straight. One of the most resonant aspects of the movie for me was how it depicted the American heartland and its people and their very sturdy moral code (a major theme of Fargo, also).  And it isn't a religious moral code either, though it does adhere to the basic Protestant tenet of doing unto others as you would have them do unto you.  In this movie there is a definite sense of people wanting to do the right thing for themselves and for others--an all-for-one attitude.  This is, for my money, the type of movie that we of the spiritually-conflicted new millennium need right now, for it brings it all down to a basic level.

The direction is frankly awful in the first half. As an executive once said of 'Heaven's Gate', there is scene after scene of beautiful images, but no film. Too adverty, too many filters and irritating slow-mo. Curiously for an epic, Scott shoots a lot of the film in close up which does not work. How did Crowe escape execution in the wood?

Like, wow!  This really is a real Mexican film! Art! Cinema! More than just a bit of popular fluff!  Tender, compassionate and very witty, like the book on which it is based, this movie celebrates Mexican culture -- not just on the food, the preparation of which forms the premise of the story, but as kind of a rollicking take on the history of the young country at the turn of the century.  It celebrates the music, the style of life on a ranch, the strength of the extended family, the beauty of the land, and the ethnic mixing pot that is every Mexican.  There is so much reckless joy and passionate love in this film, even when it portrays pain.  It openly depicts female eroticism.

Like JFK, Nixon is a film that is long but never boring, always intriguing, and one that shows sides of people (particularly Pat Nixon) and events that for most of us have always been shrouded in mystery. (Nixon's strange upbringing is especially well-presented by Stone, even if it probably lacks some historical authority.)Nevertheless, I cannot recommend Nixon, mostly because the characterization of the President seemed to me to ring just a bit untrue. Much has been said about how Anthony Hopkins so skillfully portrayed Nixon as a deeply insecure man plagued by his own personal demons. This he surely was. He was also a man with not-terribly well-developed people skills, and was no stranger to occasional public humiliation. But Hopkins's Nixon seemed so *constantly* nervous, jerky, sweaty, and generally terrified of everything around him that I could not imagine such a man gaining support from people who had actually had contact with him. As I watched scene after scene of Nixon interacting with people, I wondered whether, after he had left a room, the other characters considered sending for the paramedics to help the poor, unbalanced, and dangerously hypertense man who had just left their midst.The real Nixon, one must remember, was well-versed in public debate and was the veteran of many a political campaign. Yes, there was the blatant hollowness of Checkers. Yes, there was the deeply embarrassing press conference of 1962. But if you see, for instance, his comeback appearance on the Jack Paar Show, you see a cool, confident Nixon, one who seemed ready to take on any challenge. He was also not so completely unappealing publicly that he could not gain over 49 percent of the vote in 1960. Moreover, his real-life aides were extremely loyal to him, mostly because they believed in him strongly, though in the film  they nearly always seem to think they are in the presence of a ticking time bomb. I suppose it would have been better to see a more well-rounded view of Nixon, both the deeply disturbed and paranoid fellow who pushed people and success away with equal energy, and the occasionally well-spoken, cleverly sinister Nixon with the big grin. The end of the first half does show a rousing speech given by Nixon at the 68 convention, but by that time, I think, the damage has already been done, and the point continues to be hammered in the second half.No, I don`t think Stone could have made Nixon likeable, but he, and Hopkins, did make him into a frightening caricature rather than a frightening man.

But Hopkins's Nixon seemed so *constantly* nervous, jerky, sweaty, and generally terrified of everything around him that I could not imagine such a man gaining support from people who had actually had contact with him. As I watched scene after scene of Nixon interacting with people, I wondered whether, after he had left a room, the other characters considered sending for the paramedics to help the poor, unbalanced, and dangerously hypertense man who had just left their midst.The real Nixon, one must remember, was well-versed in public debate and was the veteran of many a political campaign. Yes, there was the blatant hollowness of Checkers. Yes, there was the deeply embarrassing press conference of 1962. But if you see, for instance, his comeback appearance on the Jack Paar Show, you see a cool, confident Nixon, one who seemed ready to take on any challenge. He was also not so completely unappealing publicly that he could not gain over 49 percent of the vote in 1960. Moreover, his real-life aides were extremely loyal to him, mostly because they believed in him strongly, though in the film  they nearly always seem to think they are in the presence of a ticking time bomb. I suppose it would have been better to see a more well-rounded view of Nixon, both the deeply disturbed and paranoid fellow who pushed people and success away with equal energy, and the occasionally well-spoken, cleverly sinister Nixon with the big grin. The end of the first half does show a rousing speech given by Nixon at the 68 convention, but by that time, I think, the damage has already been done, and the point continues to be hammered in the second half.No, I don`t think Stone could have made Nixon likeable, but he, and Hopkins, did make him into a frightening caricature rather than a frightening man.

Like JFK, Nixon is a film that is long but never boring, always intriguing, and one that shows sides of people (particularly Pat Nixon) and events that for most of us have always been shrouded in mystery. (Nixon's strange upbringing is especially well-presented by Stone, even if it probably lacks some historical authority.)Nevertheless, I cannot recommend Nixon, mostly because the characterization of the President seemed to me to ring just a bit untrue.

There is drinking, hanging out in taverns, the occasional beef leading to a fight, karaoke singing, dangerous jousts and high speed chases in cars.The familiar scenario becomes less so with the appearance of a boyish-looking girl- Teena Brandon- who looks like an extremely un-macho high school male.Hilary Swank, the actress who portrays Teena, is in almost every scene of this perfectly plotted if suspiciously predictable story.Brandon lives in Lincoln, Nebraska, but she is having a lot of difficulty there.  Her attempts at bedding a member of her same sex are getting her into serious trouble. A male friend who lives in a trailer warns that her behavior will lead to violence against her after Teena is chased to his place by gay-bashers.Teena hits on a solution.  She decides to try her luck with other girls in another city Falls City, Nebraska. Right away, the young set she encounters there take a shine to her.  Teena  fools this new crowd into believing she is a guy.  At least she fools them for awhile.

I loved it even more than the classic play on which it is based.Remaking, and especially modernizing, a classic is a delicate business.  It's terribly easy, when bringing old truths into modern idiom, to fall so far into the pool of popular culture as to lose depth, or to work so hard at making an old story accessible to a young audience that the result is pure tedium for all ages. In 1999, She's All That, a very loose and unacknowledged update of Pygmalion, gave us a perfect example of this kind of failure.  Thankfully, however, the same year brought us this movie, 10 Things I Hate About You, an update\/remake of Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew - and a great example of how to do it right.  Doing it right, you see, is not about putting the thing into modern dress and language or adding gimmicks you think will appeal to people who might otherwise expect themselves to be bored.  Doing it right is about deconstructing something old until you get right down to the barest timeless truth of the thing, the reason why the author wrote the original, the reason why you are drawn to retelling the story in the first place, and then - and only then - reconstructing the story around that truth in the spirit of the original author, but dressing it according to your own zeitgeist.Ever since my parents took me to see The Taming of the Shrew when I was eight years old, I've had kind of a love\/hate thing going on with it.  I've loved the humor, the cleverness, and the fact that everybody who deserves happiness and love gets it in the end.  The parts I've hated are, first, the part where Kate is privately humiliated, and then the part where she has to appear subservient to her husband, even though she does it for love.  Without spoiling it for you, I can tell you this is not quite what happens in 10 Things I Hate About You.Strip away all the business and temporal context of Shakespeare's Shrew and this is the message you are left with Love, trust, and respect must be earned.  They are not simply consequences of being young and cute.  Having a good relationship, loving well and being well loved, require trust and respect.  These are earned in a relationship when two people are kind, generous, and honest with each other, and bound up in all that, a little humble and a little nakedly needful and desirous of each other.And guess what?  When you strip away all the business and temporal context, this is also the message of 10 Things I Hate About You!  Of course, it's been put into modern context, young language and dress.   And I love the fact that this version has also been thoroughly adapted to the modern consciousness that a young woman can learn this stuff herself, just by being smart and true to herself, and without being forced there by a bunch of men.  I also love the way that the boys in this version of the story have to go through the same painful process and learn the same lessons.  But all the best elements of the original - the timeless truth, the humor, the cleverness, and the just deserts - remain intact.  The really cool thing about this version, though, is something I don't remember from the original.  In 10 Things, we really get to watch all the main characters grow up.  We get to watch them make choices, right and wrong, hurt each other, heal each other, and learn.  We get to watch them all become more human.

I loved it even more than the classic play on which it is based.Remaking, and especially modernizing, a classic is a delicate business.  It's terribly easy, when bringing old truths into modern idiom, to fall so far into the pool of popular culture as to lose depth, or to work so hard at making an old story accessible to a young audience that the result is pure tedium for all ages. In 1999, She's All That, a very loose and unacknowledged update of Pygmalion, gave us a perfect example of this kind of failure.  Thankfully, however, the same year brought us this movie, 10 Things I Hate About You, an update\/remake of Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew - and a great example of how to do it right.  Doing it right, you see, is not about putting the thing into modern dress and language or adding gimmicks you think will appeal to people who might otherwise expect themselves to be bored.  Doing it right is about deconstructing something old until you get right down to the barest timeless truth of the thing, the reason why the author wrote the original, the reason why you are drawn to retelling the story in the first place, and then - and only then - reconstructing the story around that truth in the spirit of the original author, but dressing it according to your own zeitgeist.Ever since my parents took me to see The Taming of the Shrew when I was eight years old, I've had kind of a love\/hate thing going on with it.  I've loved the humor, the cleverness, and the fact that everybody who deserves happiness and love gets it in the end.  The parts I've hated are, first, the part where Kate is privately humiliated, and then the part where she has to appear subservient to her husband, even though she does it for love.  Without spoiling it for you, I can tell you this is not quite what happens in 10 Things I Hate About You.Strip away all the business and temporal context of Shakespeare's Shrew and this is the message you are left with Love, trust, and respect must be earned.  They are not simply consequences of being young and cute.  Having a good relationship, loving well and being well loved, require trust and respect.  These are earned in a relationship when two people are kind, generous, and honest with each other, and bound up in all that, a little humble and a little nakedly needful and desirous of each other.And guess what?  When you strip away all the business and temporal context, this is also the message of 10 Things I Hate About You!  Of course, it's been put into modern context, young language and dress.   And I love the fact that this version has also been thoroughly adapted to the modern consciousness that a young woman can learn this stuff herself, just by being smart and true to herself, and without being forced there by a bunch of men.  I also love the way that the boys in this version of the story have to go through the same painful process and learn the same lessons.  But all the best elements of the original - the timeless truth, the humor, the cleverness, and the just deserts - remain intact.  The really cool thing about this version, though, is something I don't remember from the original.  In 10 Things, we really get to watch all the main characters grow up.  We get to watch them make choices, right and wrong, hurt each other, heal each other, and learn.  We get to watch them all become more human.  And that's the kind of transformation that makes a classic.

A genuine B movie that costed one million dollars turned out to be one of the most beautiful and inspiring things ever placed on the screens, Rocky is the result of the effort and  determination of Sylvester Stallone, who wrote the story and played the humble and simple-minded boxer who is willing to risk his own life to go the distance for self-respect. Burt Reynolds was in talks to play Rocky, and in spite of me consider myself Burt Reynolds's biggest fan in the whole world, Sylvester Stallone was  the only actor who could give life to that character, because Rocky is in a certain way Stallone's own history. At the time, Stallone  worked in films of third category and  suddenly,after the risk he took to star in Rocky, he became one of the greatest Hollywood's stars.This touching, old-fashioned film tells the story of Rocky Balboa, a guy who really never had any chance in his life.Rocky is a small-time boxer, he fights in clubs and also lives in a poor neighborhood. Everyone humiliates Rocky, including Mickey (Burgess Meredith, in a terrific performance), his trainer  you've got heart but you fight like a goddamn ape!, Mickey yells at Rocky. Then something happens. Rocky has his life turned upside down when, for some reason of the destiny, the indestructible heavy weight champion of the world Apollo Creed chooses the Italian  Stallion for an exhibition fight, that actually should be just a show for Apollo. But for Rocky, the fight is not just a show, but the last chance that he has to show to the world that any loser has the chance to conquer redemption. In the day of the fight, the arrogant Apollo is surprised by the small-time boxer who not only goes the whole distance with the champion ,but also teaches a lesson Apollo will never forget. Rocky is one of the greatest films of the century - excellent performances, a superb direction by John G. Avildsen, an involving and touching story and beautiful moments that will stay in your hearts forever - who can forget Rocky's running up the steps of the museum of Philadelphia and Bill Conti's unforgettable song, or even the scene in which Mickey (Burgess Meredith), the old trainer who never gave a chance to Rocky, lowly asks for forgiveness. When you feel sad or without hopes, watch this film. Something will change inside of you.

I must disagree. I think I liked this better than any other Hitchcock movie I've seen.Where should I start? I guess the thing I loved the most was the long takes, but hey, I'm a sucker for long takes if they're done well. The thing I liked most about the recent film Snake Eyes was the opening shot that follows Nicholas Cage all over the place for the first 8-10 minutes or so. I love the beginning of The Player because it shows the busyness and interconnectedness of life at a Hollywood studio. I love the long takes here because they are largely responsible for the pervasive creepy tension and atmosphere of the film. We, the audience, are stuck in the apartment with the two murderers and the body for the entire movie. Since the location never changes, we learn the layout of the apartment, and come to know where everything is at all times, including the body. No matter where the shot takes us, we're always thinking about that body. We wonder whether someone will find it or not, who it will be, and even if the body is actually dead (perhaps I've seen too many horror flicks, but at times I wondered if the body would suddenly wake up and pop his head out of the chest\/coffin).We also wonder where Philip is and what he is doing. Is he acting normally like Brandon, or is he still having a conscience attack and making everyone uncomfortable (including us!)? The whole effect is very claustrophobic, and it really forces the audience to identify with the characters and many of the emotions they are feeling. Our obsession with the body is surely shared by the anxious Philip, who is terrified of getting caught. Our concerns about Philip's behavior are shared by Brandon, who is surely worried that Philip will do something stupid enough that someone figures out what happened.A few parts really stand out in terms of effect. One is the part in which the maid is clearing off the chest after dinner. The camera shows her and the chest, but offscreen to the right the men are talking-either about David or something else, I can't remember. I think it's David. The tension created by this scene is incredible, for we know that once she finishes with the table, she might put the books back in and find the body. Another particularly effective part (I guess I can't say `scene,' can I?) is the very end. Hitchcock doesn't try to `enrich' it with dialogue; he simply lets the images and sounds speak for themselves.I will admit that some of the cuts were quite contrived, but I guess that's unavoidable. In a movie with 7 cuts connecting 8 extremely long takes, the cuts are bound to be relatively noticeable simply because of their rarity and the fact that we are looking for them. OK, maybe some people aren't actively looking for them, but I was. Anyway, we're so used to films with dozens or even hundreds of cuts that a movie like this really stands out. I don't know if there is any way for Hitch to make the cuts any smoother (i.e. without zooming in on Brandon's back or the chest), but for me the cuts were a bit of a distraction. One of the only things I don't like about the film.I wish more video stores carried Rope, because it is truly a fascinating movie that deserves study. 9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"28 May 2000","score":"","review":"  According to the IMDB, this wasn't one of Hitchcock's favorite movies, and is considered by many (perhaps even himself) to be an `experiment that failed.'
