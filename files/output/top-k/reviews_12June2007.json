And such ventures, unless you are blessed by a very wealthy and powerful father, as with JFK and more recently George Bush -- are totally exhausting experiences in which the candidate can feel that he is absolutely alone and that the people around him are just sucking him dry.

So he loved the sex, but what else? And who doesn't? He had a childish dream, which he casually puts forth, of wanting to be President.

Can it be that these presumably politically sensitive Hollywood stars do not sit at the feet of the Democratic Party's latter day Saint Francis?

In the mid-1920s Willis O'Brien became the first great master of the form, and in 1925 THE LOST WORLD became the first feature-length film to display it. The film was a sensation, but the stop-motion process was laborious and extremely expensive. The early 1930s found O'Brien at RKO, where he worked on a stop-motion film tentatively titled CREATION. As the Great Depression deepened, however, studio executives became increasingly wary of the cost involved and ultimately canceled the project.This would have likely been the end of O'Brien's career--but for a quirk of fate. Production partners Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack, famous for such exotic films as GRASS, CHANG, and THE FOUR FEATHERS, had arrived at the studio, and Cooper had a fantasy project a movie about a gorillas. When Cooper saw O'Brien's footage for the scuttled CREATION, he had a brainstorm that would become one of the most celebrated films of the decade KING KONG.Much of KING KONG's fascination arises from O'Brien's stop-motion animation process. At the time, it was the only way in which a film such as KING KONG could be realized, and the frame-by-frame animation process is hand made in a classic sense; adding to this fascination are the models themselves, beautifully rendered, and the miniature sets they inhabited. But KING KONG would go quiet a bit further than stop-motion; it was made with considerable technical creativity, a film of rising technology that utilized everything from rear-projection to in-camera processes to laboratory techniques. It captures a sort of critical mass in state of the art of its era.1933 audiences reacted to the film with amazement--and much may be said for contemporary audiences, albeit for considerably different reasons. Where 1933 audiences found the film frightening real, modern viewers are stunned by the meticulous detail of its pre-digital accomplishment. But if KING KONG were only a window on past cinematic technology, it would not be as widely embraced today as it is.The film has considerable merit in its directness, its pace, its score, its cast, its script, and the way in which the overall setting for O'Brien's stop-motion animation operates. It has tremendous charm, a strangely innocent quality, and it deals in archetypes that boil in our culture as powerfully today as they did more than seventy years ago. But most particularly, O'Brien and his artists and technicians succeed in endowing Kong with personality, and even today we relate to Kong in an emotional way.The recent double disk collector's tin package as a great deal going for it. KING KONG is one of the most frequently censored films in Hollywood history, with bits removed in virtually every re-release. With the exception of the Spider Pit sequence, which is likely forever lost, these cuts have been restored, and the quality of the restored cuts is as fine as the quality of the picture as a whole, something not always the case in previous video tape releases. As for the visual quality of the release, it is quite fine indeed, easily the best I have seen. Some complain that the sound has not been bumped into stereo, but I have no complaints on this point; KING KONG was filmed before the advent of stereo recording, and we hear it here very much as audiences heard it in 1933.The collectors tin is quite nice and the various paper items are enjoyable, but the bonus DVD material is of mixed quality. Two documentaries are available, and both I'm King Kong! The Exploits of Merian C. Cooper and RKO Production 601 The Making of Kong, Eighth Wonder of the World are quite good. I found the latter particularly interesting inasmuch as it demonstrates how difficult modern film makers found it to reproduce the stop-motion animation process used in the 1933 film. Peter Jackson, director of the 2005 remake, also spearheads a recreation of the lost Spider Pit sequence to extremely interesting effect, and stop-motion master Ray Harryhausen offers commentary on the surviving and very interesting snip of the aborted CREATION.Unfortunately, the audio commentary is chiefly remarkable for being utterly dismal. Archival comments by Merian C. Cooper are interesting, but Ken Ralston clearly has only very superficial knowledge of the film and effectively leads Ray Harryhausen away from making any interesting remarks of his own. As for archival comments by Fay Wray, you'll have to pay very close attention to catch them; they are so short and so insignificant that it seems likely the producers of this package included them only in order to put her name in the commentary line-up.This seems a tremendous pity, for Wray gave numerous interviews over the years concerning KING KONG; it is an opportunity missed. But most shocking of all, once again Willis O'Brien gets the short end of the stick. He figures prominently in the two documentaries, but he is never given the same level of interest as Cooper. It is an opportunity lost. But even with such drawbacks to the overall package, KING KONG remains KING KONG. One can only hope there will be a more comprehensive package in the future. Until then, we will have to make do--and with such a beautiful print of the film itself, making do is a pleasure.GFT, Amazon Reviewer ","genre":null},{"date":"12 June 2007","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Stop-motion animation was invented long before movies learned to talk.

Inspired by the director's childhood, The 400 Blows (Truffaut's first film) is primarily about a young boy growing up with his mother and stepfather in Paris and apparently heading into a life of crime. Most adults see the boy as a troublemaker, but in the film, he is meant to be the protagonist.Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre Léaud) is the boy's name. He is resourceful, quiet, and does what he can to get by. At home, he has a struggling relationship with his parents, especially his mother. She is a woman of curious interests, always distracted by her incommodious son and a secret affair with a man from her job. Antoine's stepfather appears nice enough while treating his son as an equal in a good manner, although he is not really attached to him. However, both parents share common traits they are away from home quite a bit and do not pay close enough attention to their son. Sadly enough, they only judge him by his behavior and by reports they get from other people.At school, Antoine's teacher classifies him as a menacing troublemaker. Not that it is entirely Antoine's fault, he just has terrible luck. In the opening scene of the film, we see a poster with a half-naked woman on the front being passed around quietly by the students. The teacher is sitting at his desk with his head down, grading papers, until the poster comes to Antoine and he finds it. He sends Antoine to the corner of the room, where he writes a note of resentment on the wall. As punishment for that, he is to diagram the exact words that he wrote. At home that night, Antoine's homework is interrupted. Because he did not complete it, his good friend René convinces him to skip school the next day, although Antoine is reluctant at first. They walk around France and notice Antoine's mother kissing a man that is not her husband. She and her son make eye contact, but René assures his friend that everything will be alright. The next morning, as the boys return to school, Antoine lies to his teacher and says the reason he missed school was that his mother died. Everything is alright until his mother, furious, arrives at school and her son is immediately identified as a liar.And yet, we see Antoine alone at home in some private, subtle, and hopeful moments. One of them being, his love for Balzac. He adores him, and we see him reading his biography and lighting a candle in a shrine in his honor at home. One day, at school, the students are proposed to write an essay on an important event in their life, and Antoine chooses the topic of his grandfather's death, in which he incorporates a phrase from his Balzac book. Alas, the teacher identifies this as plagiarism, and sends Antoine out of the classroom, along with René. The two boys stay at René's house for quite some time, living up to the expectations of a life of crime, until they steal a typewriter leaving Antoine caught trying to return it. He is later sent to a juvenile delinquent detention home.The 400 Blows is not meant to be a tragedy. Rather, it is a character study following Antoine Doinel's life and decisions he makes as a direct result of the many things going on in it. Even The 400 Blows captures a few moments of happiness joy. One of these is a priceless sequence in which a gym teacher is leading Antoine's class for a jog through Paris, not realizing that the boys are peeling off and running away two by two. There is another scene after Antoine's shrine for Balzac catches on fire and his parents are stressing and yelling at him. His mother suggests an outing to a movie theater, where they end up going. After the film, we see the trio in the car, laughing and reflecting on what they had seen. We see this as a moment of hope for Antoine and his family, for this being the only time they are all happy together.There are many poignant moments however, emerging late in the film after Antoine is caught for stealing the typewriter. His father is fed up with his behavior and escorts him to a police station where he is sent to a jail cell and later in a police wagon full of prostitutes and thieves, with his face peering through the bars, full of tears. His parents discuss with the authorities that they cannot not take him back because they believe he will only run away again. So, in turn, their son is taken to the juvenile delinquent school. These sequences express a reality of Antoine's life, in tune with the outcome of himself. He remains quiet and reserved towards the end of the film, as if he has nothing to say. The story of Antoine Doinel and his many experiences allow a life to be filled with curiosity and exploration. Every second of the ninety-nine minutes of the film is not wasted. Truffaut allows every minute to be overflowing with creativity while still maintaining the central story of the protagonist. It is not a film that can be taken lightly as a family movie to be watched every Saturday night. It is a film to be given plenty of thought, carefully examined, and given a conclusion. The genius of the film does not rely on that, moreover, it relies on how much is put into the film. Down to the smallest detail, the film is able to maneuver and progress. The story contains elements of sadness, regret, family, warmth, happiness, humor, values, and choices. Just like life itself.

Sadly enough, they only judge him by his behavior and by reports they get from other people.At school, Antoine's teacher classifies him as a menacing troublemaker. Not that it is entirely Antoine's fault, he just has terrible luck. In the opening scene of the film, we see a poster with a half-naked woman on the front being passed around quietly by the students. The teacher is sitting at his desk with his head down, grading papers, until the poster comes to Antoine and he finds it. He sends Antoine to the corner of the room, where he writes a note of resentment on the wall. As punishment for that, he is to diagram the exact words that he wrote. At home that night, Antoine's homework is interrupted. Because he did not complete it, his good friend René convinces him to skip school the next day, although Antoine is reluctant at first. They walk around France and notice Antoine's mother kissing a man that is not her husband. She and her son make eye contact, but René assures his friend that everything will be alright. The next morning, as the boys return to school, Antoine lies to his teacher and says the reason he missed school was that his mother died. Everything is alright until his mother, furious, arrives at school and her son is immediately identified as a liar.And yet, we see Antoine alone at home in some private, subtle, and hopeful moments. One of them being, his love for Balzac. He adores him, and we see him reading his biography and lighting a candle in a shrine in his honor at home. One day, at school, the students are proposed to write an essay on an important event in their life, and Antoine chooses the topic of his grandfather's death, in which he incorporates a phrase from his Balzac book. Alas, the teacher identifies this as plagiarism, and sends Antoine out of the classroom, along with René. The two boys stay at René's house for quite some time, living up to the expectations of a life of crime, until they steal a typewriter leaving Antoine caught trying to return it. He is later sent to a juvenile delinquent detention home.The 400 Blows is not meant to be a tragedy. Rather, it is a character study following Antoine Doinel's life and decisions he makes as a direct result of the many things going on in it. Even The 400 Blows captures a few moments of happiness joy. One of these is a priceless sequence in which a gym teacher is leading Antoine's class for a jog through Paris, not realizing that the boys are peeling off and running away two by two. There is another scene after Antoine's shrine for Balzac catches on fire and his parents are stressing and yelling at him. His mother suggests an outing to a movie theater, where they end up going. After the film, we see the trio in the car, laughing and reflecting on what they had seen. We see this as a moment of hope for Antoine and his family, for this being the only time they are all happy together.There are many poignant moments however, emerging late in the film after Antoine is caught for stealing the typewriter. His father is fed up with his behavior and escorts him to a police station where he is sent to a jail cell and later in a police wagon full of prostitutes and thieves, with his face peering through the bars, full of tears. His parents discuss with the authorities that they cannot not take him back because they believe he will only run away again. So, in turn, their son is taken to the juvenile delinquent school. These sequences express a reality of Antoine's life, in tune with the outcome of himself. He remains quiet and reserved towards the end of the film, as if he has nothing to say. The story of Antoine Doinel and his many experiences allow a life to be filled with curiosity and exploration. Every second of the ninety-nine minutes of the film is not wasted. Truffaut allows every minute to be overflowing with creativity while still maintaining the central story of the protagonist. It is not a film that can be taken lightly as a family movie to be watched every Saturday night. It is a film to be given plenty of thought, carefully examined, and given a conclusion. The genius of the film does not rely on that, moreover, it relies on how much is put into the film. Down to the smallest detail, the film is able to maneuver and progress. The story contains elements of sadness, regret, family, warmth, happiness, humor, values, and choices. Just like life itself.

The Quick and the Dead came at a time in Raimi's career when he started gravitating to slightly more mainstream fare. Before that, he was known more for fantasy and horror like the bizarre but entertaining Evil Dead films, and the quite extraordinary dark avenger film Darkman.But the Hollywood mainstream genre is not always something Raimi feels at home in. And his output in the mid to late 90s has been a little disappointing. First off was TQATD which was a box-office flop. Then he rebounded with the superb crime thriller A Simple Plan, his best film of the 90s. But then floundered with two hideously dull films For Love of the Game, and the surprisingly boring clairvoyant thriller The Gift, a film that had none of the pizazz of Raimi's earliest efforts. He then regained strength with the increasingly brilliant Spider-Man trilogy.And although TQATD was one of Raimi's less successful endeavours, its actually quite enjoyable. Raimi may have created one of the quirkiest Westerns ever made. Its filled with his trademark dizzying whip-pans and close-ups. And he infuses it with an appealing kinetic energy that helps the film gallop along at a cracking pace.Starring and co-producing, Sharon Stone is Ellen, the mysterious gunslinger who rides into the town of Redemption on a personal vendetta. She has an old score to settle with Herod (Gene Hackman on fine vindictive form), the villainous mayor of Redemption. He holds sway over the townspeople with an iron fist, and he has quite an ingenious method of rooting out his enemies.Every year, the town holds a tournament where the best gunfighters square off against one another for an enormous cash prize. But no one ever wins. Because Herod is the fastest gun in Redemption. And he can out-draw anyone. Ellen intends to change that. So the gunfighters sign up. Including Herod's son, the Kid (Leonardo DiCaprio), and a former outlaw turned preacher, Cort (a pre-stardom Russell Crowe).Although TQATD is quite slim plot-wise, its a bit hard not to get carried away by the film. The eclectic cast goes some way towards making the film more enjoyable than it should be. Its nice to see Sharon Stone trying to shake typecasting as a sex symbol. In fact I never thought it possible that someone as beautiful as Sharon Stone could look so weatherbeaten, but it seems it is. Even so, she is an actress with a limited range, and her stolid performance is a fundamental flaw that works against the film.Everyone else in the cast looks like they're having a grand old time. But Stone walks around the set trying to sap the fun out of every scene. And as such, its difficult to root for her as a heroine. Even a burned out wreck like Sigourney Weaver's Ripley had a wry sense of humour.Its in the supporting cast where we get some vitality. Gene Hackman steals the film right out from under everyone else as the monstrous Herod. He's clearly having a ball as the lord and master of Redemption. He shoots people with nary a glance. And he loves antagonising Cort.Cort used to ride with Herod's gang of outlaws, but changed his ways and became a preacher. Herod loves making an example of him, putting him on public display, trying to get him to embrace his dark side. Those scenes are reminiscent of Darkman, about another inherently decent man who found himself giving in to his destructive urges.Russell Crowe spends most of the film chained up and dragged along saloon floors and dirt, but its a quietly intense performance on his part. And he knows his way around a shooting iron.And then there's Leonardo DiCaprio as the Kid. DiCaprio is an actor who tends to do best when his enthusiasm and cocky charisma is really allowed to shine. And the slick, trigger-happy Kid is a character perfectly suited to his acting style. He's a real sharp-shooter, who fires off wisecracks just as hard and fast. Although I think his character arc could have done without the subplot about wanting to prove himself to his old man. It makes his death a little odd, and even unintentionally mawkish.But there are other pleasures to be found in the wonderful variations Raimi gets out of the different gunfights. There's some amazing camera angles, like a POV shot through a bullet wound. There are too many to recall, but its a constant source of interest what Raimi will cook up next. And the musical score from Alan Silvestri recalls many a Spaghetti Western.Good ending too with the exploding clock tower, the haunting flashback into Ellen's past, and Herod's last stand. The Quick and the Dead will never be a classic like some other Westerns, but I found it a lot of fun, a nice change of pace for Sam Raimi, and a reaffirmation of why Gene Hackman is one of the finest actors in the world.

However, the far more common approach for such films is one which glorifies Hollywood, celebrating the business which brings magic into the minds and hearts of millions of people every day. Far less common are films like Robert Altman's The Player - films which dare to show the inner workings of the movie industry without the shiny, day glow exterior, and expose some of the darker and grittier aspects of the industry, while still maintaining a quietly satirical touch. Director Robert Altman cunningly paints his film with a very realistic, almost documentary feel, as if as well as following the plot the viewer is also watching a behind the scenes feature on Hollywood producers. But at the same time, the film itself proves to be essentially an immense inside joke in the sense that it pokes fun at certain conventions of Hollywood films, but at the same time works them into the plot itself, in a smarmy, mocking fashion. (note a gratuitous sex scene, a disturbingly happy ending, even an almost contrived feeling mystery element complete with occasional violent bits) The script, by Michael Tolkin, is quick, clever and unflinching, and is without a question what really makes the film most worth watching, as well as the simply brilliant editing and cinematography (filming a sex scene only showing extreme close-ups on the actors' faces was a particularly garish touch which suited the tone of the film exquisitely) which perfectly capture the film in a fresh and innovative fashion. Rather than launching a huge smear campaign against the monstrosities and immense luxuries of the movie industry (it would be interesting to see how such a movie, one which attempts to tear down the industry producing it, would be marketed...) Altman is content to nudge gently rather than shove angrily. The film is subtle in its criticisms of the Hollywood way of life, but still makes its points abundantly clear, without shoving its ideology into the audience's face. This show rather than tell narrative structure proves far more effective, as the audience is free to come to their own conclusions regarding the ethics of the movies, rather than having a viewpoint shoved down their throat in an abrasive fashion. Altman is also insightful enough to add a quietly comic touch to the film; while the film does serve as a commentary on the movie industry, it maintains an ever so subtle satirical touch, making it difficult to decide if the movie is meant to be more of a cynical exposé or a black comedy. It seems most likely that the result is somewhere in between the two, and either way a refreshingly different take on storytelling - which is ironic, given the film pokes fun at the static creativity in Hollywood. Tim Robbins is a perfect piece of casting as Griffin Mill, the slimy, Machiavellian Hollywood producer. Robbins exudes a laid back, almost reptilian charm which perfectly compliments his character - although Mill is essentially a despicable character who commits unethical action after unethical action, always getting away with it, we can't help but still be taken in by him. Greta Scacchi is a bizarre but beguiling presence as the mysterious painter who drifts into Mill's life, and Peter Gallagher is a perfect fit for the part of a naive Hollywood super agent. Whoopi Goldberg is an unquestionably odd choice for the role of an eccentric detective, yet the role fits the quirky tone of the film well. Vincent D'Onofrio shines in his brief role as obsessive screenwriter David Kahane, and Sydney Pollack contributes a wonderful little role as Mill's lawyer. It is also impossible to refer to this film without mentioning the immense quantity of lovingly tongue in cheek celebrity cameos, (John Cusack, Jeff Goldblum, Malcolm McDowell, Burt Reynolds, Julia Roberts and Bruce Willis, whose appearance near the end of the film, a scathing stab at the stereotypical action film is arguably the film's most enjoyable moment) and it really shows Altman's directorial clout that so many stars were willing to come in and poke fun at their industry, almost unanimously for free. Their presence not only strengthens the believability of the plot itself, but also re-enforces that the points Altman is attempting to make in regards to his industry are not altogether unfounded, or such vast quantities of celebrities would not be so openly supporting his film. All things considered, The Player is a fresh take on the increasingly common topic of show business, but it's Altman's cinematic voice, and Tolkin's crackling script, underhanded but twinkling with quiet wit, which really makes the film worthwhile. Robbins perfectly convinces in his part, the greasy soul of the film, and his casting is enough to carry the occasional plot misfires which do arise from time to time. On retrospect, the entire gist of the film can be summed up in a single scene, where Griffin Mill goes to an independent art theater in search of writer David Kahane and ends up watching the end of The Bicycle Thief, an old Italian classic. Mill's response to the film, an attempt to win over the favour of scorned writer Kahane is by saying That was a good movie, I should do a remake of it.

I really was hoping I would like it even though the trailer didn't impress me. Well, it turned out being worse than I thought. Meanwhile, Fincher continues to get worse with each effort. The only reason I didn't rank this as 1 was on account of the brilliant Ed Norton. Pitt just plays himself the same way he usually does. The violence gets really old quickly and so does the film.

It doesn't take long or it is decided that this group leaves their homes for the trip of their lives.The movie isn't so much about finding the body of the deceased kid, it also isn't about the trip. It actually is about friendship, growing up and how friendship and people change during certain events in their lives.As they continue on their hiking trip, they have to deal with certain personal issues that everyone encounters in their life. By the end of the film, they haven't physically but mentally grown up because of what they experienced together... as friends.I always have been felt moved by Stand Be Me because of what they go trough and their friendship. Because the whole situation is so real, some moments do come over as a bit scary.The ending of the movie is what's most touching. Both his character and eventually himself later in his life share the same fate. This gives the ending of Stand By Me a more powerful and emotional meaning.Also seeing Richard Dreyfus as the grown up Gordie LaChance with his kids playing outside is powerful kids grow up and go their own ways often 'forgetting' their friends. Even though this happens, deep inside them the friendship still goes on forever.For their age, all 4 boys did a superb acting job. I don't think it's easy to find talented actors at that age today.My score for Stand By Me is 9 out of 10.

It had a pretty high rating at IMDb and it's praised all over the place, but I just wasn't so interested of it. Well, it turned out to be an excellent movie. The movie tells a story happening in Los Angeles in the 1950's and it tells about a corruption occurring all over the police force and a committed murder, which three different polices start to investigate in their own unique ways. Ed Exley, the golden boy of the police force, smart and the one obeying the law. Bud White, a rough man ready to break the law to seek justice. Then there's Jack Vincennes, a celebrity detective being the one who does the job for publicity and press photos, but still managing something with his smart, yet somewhat crooked ways.There are two things about this movie which make it so magnificent; The storyline and the cast. The storyline is filled with excitement and it keeps on going all the way through. After the first hour the movie kind of stops a little bit and it seems like it starts to stumble, or that's at least what you think. There are these scenes which seem like irrelevant, but they eventually get important for the whole plot in a genius way. This movie is a perfect example of how to make a real crime\/detective movie, there's the crime in the beginning and after that there's just this fantastic progression of the whole investigation from the very beginning till the very end, detectives finding interesting and also very surprising clues during the progress. Then there's the amazing cast; Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, James Cromwell, Kim Basinger, David Strathairn, Danny DeVito.. Honestly, can you think of any better? Great indeed.This leads up myself to the acting the movie has to offer. The role performances are all in all fantastic. Ed Exley is played by Guy Pearce and I really haven't seen Pearce in a role like Exley before, but I am happy to say that he is great in it. Then there's the always superb Russell Crowe playing Bud White, the real bad ass cop. If someone can play a bad ass and look so furious it's Crowe without a doubt. He's just so frightening. Finally there is Kevin Spacey as Jack Vincennes and as I've watched more than a few Spacey movies recently I'm starting to like him more and more and he is starting to be one of my favourite actors. In this movie he still is as excellent as you can pretty much expect from him. Pearce, Crowe and Spacey shine with astonishing role performances and they are the best thing the cast has to offer. I'm not underestimating the rest of the cast at all though, as there is the fierce James Cromwell, the beautiful Kim Basinger, the somewhat charismatic and cool David Stathairn and then there's the tiny but incredible Danny DeVito, who I haven't really seen in a more fitting role and he does some damn fine job in it too. Cromwell is enjoyable as usual, Basinger does what she does best and Strathairn is the coolness itself, though in my opinion he was better in Good Night, and Good Luck. Still a great achievement though.L.A. Confidential offers you a great movie experience. It sets mark on how detective movies should be made and how the whole crime investigation process should be progressing. It's exciting and it's interesting, doing that all the way through. It includes fantastic role performances and brilliant characters which all in their vivid personalities will most certainly not disappoint the viewer. It doesn't get messy in any part so the viewer won't be missing anything and won't get lost, so the film is also easy for your eyes. Directed by Curtis Hanson who captures the real essence of 1950's through images and music and based on the novel by James Ellroy which is translated to a magnificent screenplay in the hands of Brian Helgeland and the director Hanson himself, it just doesn't go wrong. I'm recommending this movie to everyone; The pleasure was all mine when watching it and I hope it will be yours as well.

It is a little hard to get into, at first, as being a very strong film based on the sharply timed shocks and paranoia of Carpenter's horror as a director as well as the ideas presented by the writer, and it does veer into going into the same wild level of deliriousness that soon enough becomes the lead character. But it's a work as well where Carpenter is testing himself, and succeeding in a carefree but controlled way, where he goes for having his cake and eating it too. He gets to throw up on the screen some grisly (and, as a possible tip of the hat to the groundbreaking effects from the Thing, a sometimes funny knock-off) special creature effects and with some masterful displays in editing through the images of abstractions into the character's subconscious, while questioning what he's doing all the time, or at least the genre he and others (notably Stephen King) make their bread and butter.It's a sort of slightly smarter pulp sci-fi\/horror piece, not quite at the insane brilliance of They Live though perhaps in its more deliberate fashion a little creepier, as investigator John Trent (Sam Neill) is investigating the disappearance of a severely popular horror novelist, who's books sometimes make people go a little nuts. Trent sees this first-hand from novelist Sutter Cane's agent, who comes at him wielding an axe (it's one of those pure points in the film that mixed the macabre and satire, something Craven didn't quite get at with New Nightmare). He thinks it's a hoax, and soon discovers that he may be in a (fictional?) town called Hobbs End in New Hampshire. What he finds, in typical Carpenter fashion, is describable as being a psychological flip-flopper, where Trent goes from thinking it's all a gag with it being very elaborate, to it suddenly not being, at all. Creatures (supplied wonderfully by KNB) start popping out, disgusting ones that aren't much human, and it even gets to Trett's female companion\/literary liaison on the trip. Soon Cane is found in some dank cellar (Jurgen Purchnow, one of Carpenter's most chilling villains in how subtle he is), and he has a new book ready for Trett to bring to the world...This isn't quite where the film gets weird, though it's probably a little before or a little after this point, and the kind of weirdness I had been hoping to build up. Although it does get close for writer De Luca to being shaky with balancing really dark humor- however in small doses, and depending on how seriously one takes the more overt horror elements- and at the plight of Trent's mind-set in the midst of total Armageddon, Carpenter levels the playing field without missing too many beats. I kept having my mouth hang open either in a 'what the hell' mode or just in sort of plain shock. But it's an entertaining mix and match all the way for a genre fan, and Sam Neill is definitely up for the challenge of playing as well level-headed and rational Trett for the first half, then slowly but surely descending into his own subconscious state of peril- or, perhaps, Trent losing sight on what is perceived as reality or not. Only Neill could go between serious dramatic roles to films like this and Jurassic Park, where his characters' confidence as the practical pragmatist starts to waver as a descent into disaster goes further and further.What Carpenter ends on in the last section of his apocalypse trilogy isn't necessarily a closed-and-shut ending either; I sense that he wants things to be a little closer to the Thing's end, where it's all doom and gloom but there's a wink to the protagonist's state of mind. Trett's last minutes wandering the streets and going into the movie theater watching himself doesn't really spell anything conclusive, I think, which adds all the more to the fun and intrigue. He could just be still in his hospital room, still in the world that dismisses Cane as pulp-sensationalist trash, albeit successful pulp-sensationalist trash (a little relevant today, eg Dan Brown), and not among the total bat-s*** mess that the world has become while locked in his padded room. It's a question left to the viewer, and a smart one to put up in a film that has by this point thrived mostly on its own sensationalism as well, tongue-in-cheek in the guise of crazy small-town break-out scenario.

Only Neill could go between serious dramatic roles to films like this and Jurassic Park, where his characters' confidence as the practical pragmatist starts to waver as a descent into disaster goes further and further.What Carpenter ends on in the last section of his apocalypse trilogy isn't necessarily a closed-and-shut ending either; I sense that he wants things to be a little closer to the Thing's end, where it's all doom and gloom but there's a wink to the protagonist's state of mind. Trett's last minutes wandering the streets and going into the movie theater watching himself doesn't really spell anything conclusive, I think, which adds all the more to the fun and intrigue. He could just be still in his hospital room, still in the world that dismisses Cane as pulp-sensationalist trash, albeit successful pulp-sensationalist trash (a little relevant today, eg Dan Brown), and not among the total bat-s*** mess that the world has become while locked in his padded room. It's a question left to the viewer, and a smart one to put up in a film that has by this point thrived mostly on its own sensationalism as well, tongue-in-cheek in the guise of crazy small-town break-out scenario. As a Carpenter fan, I say, bring it on.

Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Thomas F. Wilson, and (strictly in Part III) Mary Steenburgen for their superlative acting. (If you have not yet seen any of the trilogy, DO NOT read any further.) The basic premise of Part III is that Marty McFly (Fox) must travel back to the Wild West in the year 1885 in order to save Dr. Emmett L. Doc Brown (Lloyd) from being shot by the notorious gunman Buford Mad Dog Tannen (Wilson), who happens to be the great-grandfather of Biff Tannen (Wilson again), Marty's arch nemesis from the first two movies. While in 1885, Doc falls in love with schoolteacher Clara Clayton (Steenburgen), with their common interests being a love of science and a fascination with the writings of Jules Verne.My favorite highlights from Back to the Future Part III include the following. Obviously, the most thrilling sequence in the picture is the perilous train ride back to the future! At the film's conclusion, Doc summarizes the whole trilogy by telling Marty and his girlfriend Jennifer (Elisabeth Shue) that their future is whatever they make it. Upon first arriving in 1885, Marty panics as he speedily drives the DeLorean time vehicle away from a Native American attack and then witnesses an exciting charge of the U.S. Cavalry! Marty tries to escape Buford and his gang from a saloon but is easily overpowered as Buford ropes & drags him to his potential hanging site. At the climactic shoot-out, Marty replaces his handgun with his fists in order to defeat Buford. And at the Hill Valley Town Festival (probably the most fun scene for the cast & crew to film), one of the lively dance tunes we hear is actually the ZZ Top hit Double Back. Doc mentions in Back to the Future Part III how he wishes he had never invented his DeLorean time machine, claiming that it has caused nothing but trouble, but in reality, Doc is wrong. In the end, Doc avoids being shot by Buford, marries his sweetheart Clara, and raises two kids with her, along with his ever faithful dog Einstein. As for Marty, over the course of the trilogy he not only greatly improves his family life but also learns not to lose his cool whenever someone calls him a derogatory name such as chicken. Overall, the entire Back to the Future trilogy is so well done that I am still enchanted whenever I watch it.

Though I've seen every 007 films, some several times, I cannot describe myself as being an avid fan, so I can't be bothered with who was the best Bond and which film was most faithful to the books and which Bond girl was the best, etc. Differentiating one Bond film from the next is almost like differentiating one Twinkie from another Twinkie simply put, it's formula film-making. With GOLDEN GUN, I can sorta see why some might think it's not up to the usual 007 extravaganza it just doesn't follow the formula like other Bond films. There are no gadgets here and the ending is not as spectacular as other Bond flicks or some characters (the sheriff) might seem trite but of all other 007 adventures, this is the most down to earth one. I love the fact that there's no huge battle at the climax or ridiculous gadgets (the invisible car in DIE ANOTHER DAY, for example). This a Bond adventure that can actually be described as being sorta believable, which is no mean feat. What's remarkable about GOLDEN GUN is the cinematography. The composition, the natural colors, the realism of it all. I've just watched the latest DVD edition and the image is clear and beautiful. Gone is the grubby cinematography of LIVE AND LET DIE. But it's also not as super-slick as other Bond made before or after this one. It's an odd thing to cite beautiful cinematography for such a commercial project as this one. The most stunning scenes are at the end, when Bond flies to Scaramanga's secret base.The other great thing about GOLDEN GUN is casting Christopher Lee as Scaramanga. It's his best role\/performance ever. And he's the best villain in any 007 film. Scaramanga is a real character, not a cartoon villain like 90% of Bond villains. The fact that the story is about two men going mano a mano is also a nice change from the tired villain who wants to dominate the world plot line. Casting Lee as Scaramanga was a stroke of genius. He's what makes THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN so memorable.Lastly, the other memorable element is John Barry's score. It's one of his most evocative for a James Bond film. When I hear it, I can't get it out of my mind.As Bond girls, Britt Ekland and Maud Adams are absolutely gorgeous. Though Adams' acting can be described as stiff, she's one of the classiest and is the saddest Bond girl ever (her actions propel the story) while Ekland is funny as the ditsy operative. The belly dancer at the beginning was, hmm, scary looking though.

And let's not forget about Herve Villechaize as Nick Nack. He almost steals every scene he's in, which is either good or bad, depending on how you like him.

Though I've seen every 007 films, some several times, I cannot describe myself as being an avid fan, so I can't be bothered with who was the best Bond and which film was most faithful to the books and which Bond girl was the best, etc. Differentiating one Bond film from the next is almost like differentiating one Twinkie from another Twinkie simply put, it's formula film-making. With GOLDEN GUN, I can sorta see why some might think it's not up to the usual 007 extravaganza it just doesn't follow the formula like other Bond films. There are no gadgets here and the ending is not as spectacular as other Bond flicks or some characters (the sheriff) might seem trite but of all other 007 adventures, this is the most down to earth one. I love the fact that there's no huge battle at the climax or ridiculous gadgets (the invisible car in DIE ANOTHER DAY, for example). This a Bond adventure that can actually be described as being sorta believable, which is no mean feat. What's remarkable about GOLDEN GUN is the cinematography. The composition, the natural colors, the realism of it all. I've just watched the latest DVD edition and the image is clear and beautiful. Gone is the grubby cinematography of LIVE AND LET DIE. But it's also not as super-slick as other Bond made before or after this one. It's an odd thing to cite beautiful cinematography for such a commercial project as this one. The most stunning scenes are at the end, when Bond flies to Scaramanga's secret base.The other great thing about GOLDEN GUN is casting Christopher Lee as Scaramanga. It's his best role\/performance ever. And he's the best villain in any 007 film. Scaramanga is a real character, not a cartoon villain like 90% of Bond villains. The fact that the story is about two men going mano a mano is also a nice change from the tired villain who wants to dominate the world plot line. Casting Lee as Scaramanga was a stroke of genius. He's what makes THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN so memorable.Lastly, the other memorable element is John Barry's score. It's one of his most evocative for a James Bond film. When I hear it, I can't get it out of my mind.As Bond girls, Britt Ekland and Maud Adams are absolutely gorgeous. Though Adams' acting can be described as stiff, she's one of the classiest and is the saddest Bond girl ever (her actions propel the story) while Ekland is funny as the ditsy operative. The belly dancer at the beginning was, hmm, scary looking though.

Why? Probably because when the first movie showed up in 1988, McClane stood out as a normal guy, as opposed to the various Rambos and Terminators that kept invading the screens. He was an ordinary man in an extraordinary situation (think Jack Bauer's elder brother), and that's what's helped cement his status as one of the most enduring action heroes of all time.The franchise-opener (and arguably the best of the three) sees Willis' police officer trapped in a huge building (the Nakatomi Towers) where his wife (Bonnie Bedelia) and several other people are being held hostage by German criminal Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) and his team. The situation looks hopeless, unless someone decides to take down the terrorists one by one. And given the lack of more suitable heroes, it seems like McClane will have to do it.The character's popularity is indelibly linked to his vulnerability unlike Sylvester Stallone or Arnold Schwarzenegger, who walked out of their movies with no scratches and a pack of dead bodies behind them, Willis leaves the scene bruised and battered (in one installment, he even gets to say It looks so easy in the movies!), even though the body count remains very high. Another thing that sets him apart from his predecessors is his verbosity whereas Arnie and Sly killed without as much as whispering, McClane keeps on talking, using quick wit and effective curses to comment on his bad situation.

And that's why I love this movie so much - It has this factual atmosphere, which I think is far more realistic that if it would have been dramatized; because in this documentation style, everything that happens seems to be so real. For sure this is a question of taste whether you rather like it realistic or bloody, but I think it is good the movie is so factual.- The figures in this movie are worked out really good, for example the crazy hitch-hiker, the emotionless-seeming Kirk, (sexy) Pam with her bad presentiments (as the movie shows, she was perfectly right), and not to forget, the filling station attendant with his rough attitude and his mixture of sympathy and lust for kill. The actors are all really good and you can identify with the group of teenagers.- Tobe Hooper is very good in building up excitemtent. For more than an hour, there is nothing cruel or scaring, just a few bad signs (the hitch-hiker of course, or the drunken guy telling them sinnister things), everything seems to be so happy, but then Kirk gets careless, and at one go, the whole day turns into a massacre.- There is a lot of brutality in this movie, but Tobe Hooper isn't in need of bloody slasher scenes like in Hostel or in the remake. All brutality is rather in the viewer's fantasy than on the screen. It's the atmosphere (for example this legendary starting scene) and the insinuated sequences that make this movie so scaring.- It is thrilling till the end. Sally, who will be the only one to survive, is not personated as the hero of the movie (like Jessica Biel in the remake), and she is captured in the house and nearly killed.

For more than an hour, there is nothing cruel or scaring, just a few bad signs (the hitch-hiker of course, or the drunken guy telling them sinnister things), everything seems to be so happy, but then Kirk gets careless, and at one go, the whole day turns into a massacre.- There is a lot of brutality in this movie, but Tobe Hooper isn't in need of bloody slasher scenes like in Hostel or in the remake. All brutality is rather in the viewer's fantasy than on the screen. It's the atmosphere (for example this legendary starting scene) and the insinuated sequences that make this movie so scaring.- It is thrilling till the end. Sally, who will be the only one to survive, is not personated as the hero of the movie (like Jessica Biel in the remake), and she is captured in the house and nearly killed. Even in the last sequence of the movie is is not clear until the end whether Leatherfae gets her or not.

Only the name says it all On the one hand it sounds hard, cruel and dramatic, on the other hand, it might be the title of a documentation as well. And that's why I love this movie so much - It has this factual atmosphere, which I think is far more realistic that if it would have been dramatized; because in this documentation style, everything that happens seems to be so real.

I have this rule because the only thing worse than a bad movie is a bad movie thats really long. This movie wasn't really bad, but was really just OK, and definitely not worth the 4 hour run time (directors cut). The back story of how the characters grew up and was good and the plot, sets and costumes made up for the bad kid acting in the first section of the film, but things go way downhill from there.First off, the movie is like a ride in a broken time machine. why does the director or editor think its appropriate to jump around from decade to decade? How does that help tell the story? It doesn't, it just makes a long and complicated story very difficult for the viewer to follow (and I had the subtitles on so i didn't miss a word). The dialogue gives the actors very little to work with as Deniro has a blank stare throughout the film. Then there is the timing of the delivery, its like who is it? 10 seconds later its me. And I'm left thinking, wtf? Is that extra 10 seconds supposed to be 'dramatic'? Well its not its annoying and in a film this long, you'd think you'd want to keep the action moving. There are a few scenes where Max (james woods) is able to show us his ability to act but it happens in a way that makes the story seem unbelievable. I am left thinking, good acting but why would this character behave like that? This guy goes from never robbing a bank, to wanting to rob the federal reserve? its just too stupid, and Max isn't that stupid.The love story that develops makes absolutely no sense and is interrupted with other scenes of random and quite disturbing bizarreness. I could go on, but unlike Sergio Leone, I know when to stop. The movie had a good start and a good premise, but the plot went everywhere, too many people did too many things that didn't make sense, none of the characters are electrifying, and the film is just waaay too long to be enjoyable in spite of all of that.
