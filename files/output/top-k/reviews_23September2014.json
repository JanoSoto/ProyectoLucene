Its been almost 7 decades since this movie has been shot and what the movie is trying to convey can still be applied to our day and that is, the problem with being a teenager. The problem with not knowing where you belong and where you should be.Time Stark and his fellow friends each represent this problem. However, the movie's main concern isn't this problem. In my opinion, the movie's main concern is how parents lead to this problem and lack in bonding with their teenager to fix this problem.The movie does a great job in showing reckless teenagers, but does an even better job showing the more reckless parents. Society should question themselves here. Why are teenagers having these problems? What is the core of the problem? The answer is easy; family. In the end of the movie this is what I understand and I believe that it is a great message to give. So one factor that makes this movie successful is the main theme and message it gives. There are other factors also; like the acting of the main characters and especially Tim Stark. However, without going onto further detail with the other factors of why the movie is good, I want to also mention why I dropped 4 stars out of the movie.The movie is definitely saying something but it loses one star from the lack of ability to combine effective music with the scenes. It loses the second star from the inefficient acting ability of the background actors. Next, it loses the third star from some unneeded scenes that just took up time. For example, the scene with Tim's parents and his dialogs with his father were very lengthy. Lastly, it loses the fourth star because of lack of emotion in the movie. The movie could have raised its standards with the use of more emotional scenes. After all, teenage years are one of the most emotional years of a human's lifetime. Therefore, it can be said that it is a sufficient movie with a nice little message that could have been conveyed better.

The reason or motive behind these attacks is unknown but the birds show absolutely no remorse.Hitchcock was always great at giving us incredible female leads, and Tippi Hedren's 'Melanie Daniels was no different. You don't even find out a lot about her character, only that she is determined to bring the two love birds to Mitch, a recently stranger turned friend. The film alludes to the fact that the attacks only begin once she arrives on site. But even then we don't truly know the motive behind it all. I didn't find the supporting performances to be all that great, in fact i found the mothers to be a bit revolting at times. The children were also at times obnoxious.The first hour of the film is very calm and reminiscent of a Hitchcock romance but when the attacks begin, they don't let up. The scene at the schoolhouse is iconic and is impossible to remove from your mind. The way Hitchcock shows Melanie's point of view all the way to the hundreds of crows just waiting to attack was marvelous. In what started as a soothing first hour, ends with a terrifying last 50 minutes. Much like every fantasy like story, most people don't believe the attacks are real until they eventually witness the downtown explosions with several people dying.

He creates such a style and performance originality, in this real out there offbeat film, we are still reminded, of what a super great or more correctly, unique actor, he was, his acting talent and versatility, stretching more, than that of De Caprio. Along with Reeves, who's fair here, they're homeless hustlers, who dirty old pervs, mainly men, pay them for their services. Phoenix is on a search to find his mother, that takes him, with best friend Reeves, across a few states, to no avail. The film has comical moments, as well as some intriguing scenes, this fascinating piece of work, is not tainted one bit, in it's twenty two years of it's existence when watching it. Rich handsome, older perv, Hans (Udo Kier) has one trademark scene, where he's doing an exotic dance, lamp and all, to an old fifties tune, for our two hustler's benefit. A later scene has the three in a naked menois de trois of pose shots, Phoenix wearing bra and panties, that honestly wanted to make me puke, as a couple of other scenes did, like one young hustler, describing some sexual wants of his customer. I loved James Remar in this, his confrontation with Phoenix, when trying to pass him off as not his real father, his corny story I loved. The scene stealer here, was the veteran homeless drunk, Bob, a deep charismatic, and thespian orchestrated performance. What was the real heartbreaking moment of the film to be honest, was the severing friendship of Phoenix and Reeves towards the end, as Reeves falls for someone of the opposite sex, while turning his back on his whole homeless troupe. Reeves living up the high life after pop passes away, had me questioning if this was real, as it just seemed weird, in light of all that happened before this. o me this part didn't seem real. A lot of images to this film (dolphins flying through the sea, a barn crashing down, etc) and many other offbeat attractions, make this film, one of those fascinating and undying classics of peculiar tastes. I couldn't understand though as a hustler in this, Phoenix, wasn't attracting much female clientele. The whole attraction to this film is it's weirdness, and it doesn't stop, being weird right up to the end. If you love River Phoenix, you have to watch this film. Gus Van Sant's most daring work.

That is all I was looking for - a nice little cat and mouse chase with laughter and fun thrown in throughout the film - sadly you get none of that here.I'm aware that this film has been adapted from Homer's Odyssey, but I'm not going to claim I know much about this work. I am aware that some of the characters and scenarios depicted in this film are based on this Odyssey, but does that make it a good film? God no!!!! The problem with this film is that many characters are introduced and then disappear seemingly without any point or purpose. Let's look at a few examples;GEORGE NELSON - a mobster whose character is presumably meant to be some kind of parody of Baby Face Nelson whose real name is also George Nelson. His character arrives and the only memorable scene involving his character and our trio of fugitives was a rather disgusting scene which involved him shooting cattle and then their pursuers running a couple of cattle over. Is this meant to be funny? It was pretty sick if you ask me. His character is then randomly introduced at the end when he's arrested and sentenced to death - again possibly a parable of the life of the real life character. TOMMY JOHNSON - a hitchhiker that our trio pick up who has sold his soul to the devil. He then quickly disappears and then reappears later in the film when he's captured by the KKK who wish to sacrifice him because he sold his soul to the devil??? I honestly couldn't believe how stupid it all was.DAN TEAGUE - a religious fanatic whose character served no real purpose in the film other than to shock the audience. I like John Goodman, but his presence in this film wasn't enough to save this catastrophe of a film.Added to a whole host of pointless characters the Coens also present you with a screenplay that's a complete mess - they'd go from one scene to the next without any sort of logical connection. As I've mentioned characters are introduced and then disappear without any real explanation and then are reintroduced in the most ridiculous and contrived of ways. Factor all of this with a stupid sub plot involving two government officials both fighting to win people's vote. What the hell did that have to do with anything? Also, I thought this was meant to be a film where the fugitives are being pursued. Did anyone really get the feeling that they were actually being chased? I think I only saw the law enforcement official about 3 times during the entire 105 minute running time.I would have forgiven most of the above if the film had even been remotely funny, but it couldn't even fulfil that basic need. We have the running joke of RUNOFT. Is that supposed to be a joke about how people speak in the Deep South or is the joke that they are thick and are unable to spell? That was lost on me. Then there's the scene at the start where our trio of fugitives randomly enter an establishment and start singing into a pan. What the hell was that all about? I kept scratching my head and wondering if I just didn't 'get' it.The main failings of this film are simply that there's too much going on; too many characters who serve no purpose, too many sub plots, it wasn't remotely funny, poor chemistry between the 3 leads. I think the Coens may possibly have been trying to weave stories together, but it doesn't work because there's just too much going on and too much for the average viewer to take in. The only positive I took from this was the initial scene with the blind man on the rail road where he says 'There's a fortune out there, but there's a long road ahead of you to reach that fortune'.

Is this meant to be funny? It was pretty sick if you ask me. His character is then randomly introduced at the end when he's arrested and sentenced to death - again possibly a parable of the life of the real life character. TOMMY JOHNSON - a hitchhiker that our trio pick up who has sold his soul to the devil. He then quickly disappears and then reappears later in the film when he's captured by the KKK who wish to sacrifice him because he sold his soul to the devil??? I honestly couldn't believe how stupid it all was.DAN TEAGUE - a religious fanatic whose character served no real purpose in the film other than to shock the audience. I like John Goodman, but his presence in this film wasn't enough to save this catastrophe of a film.Added to a whole host of pointless characters the Coens also present you with a screenplay that's a complete mess - they'd go from one scene to the next without any sort of logical connection. As I've mentioned characters are introduced and then disappear without any real explanation and then are reintroduced in the most ridiculous and contrived of ways. Factor all of this with a stupid sub plot involving two government officials both fighting to win people's vote. What the hell did that have to do with anything? Also, I thought this was meant to be a film where the fugitives are being pursued. Did anyone really get the feeling that they were actually being chased? I think I only saw the law enforcement official about 3 times during the entire 105 minute running time.I would have forgiven most of the above if the film had even been remotely funny, but it couldn't even fulfil that basic need. We have the running joke of RUNOFT. Is that supposed to be a joke about how people speak in the Deep South or is the joke that they are thick and are unable to spell? That was lost on me. Then there's the scene at the start where our trio of fugitives randomly enter an establishment and start singing into a pan. What the hell was that all about? I kept scratching my head and wondering if I just didn't 'get' it.The main failings of this film are simply that there's too much going on; too many characters who serve no purpose, too many sub plots, it wasn't remotely funny, poor chemistry between the 3 leads. I think the Coens may possibly have been trying to weave stories together, but it doesn't work because there's just too much going on and too much for the average viewer to take in. The only positive I took from this was the initial scene with the blind man on the rail road where he says 'There's a fortune out there, but there's a long road ahead of you to reach that fortune'. It's clever because it makes the audience believe one thing, but by the end it's interpreted as something else. That is the only positive that I got from this film.

This movie introduced Japanese cinema to the West back in 1950 and pretty much launched Kurosawa's international career.The main innovation Rashomon introduced in the film world is portraying the same story over and over, in four ways it was perceived by multiple characters. This was ground breaking back in the day when films usually carried a straight-forward storyline. We're never told the correct way the events unfolded and are left with our imagination on what actually happened in the grove. The characters twist the story depending on their class or honour. For example, the sword fight between the bandit and the samurai is seen as an epic, polished battle through the eyes of the bandit, but also as a life-or-death struggle between two desperate men in the eyes of the woodcutter. The characters retell their testimonies to the camera, making it appear like the audience itself is the judge.The music is great and very fitting. A lot of people are put off by the version of Bolero played during the wife's story, but I think it fits wonderfully and is the best version of Bolero I've ever heard.The cinematography also deserves a mention. Characters' motives and actions in the film aren't painted in a black and white manner and the visuals reflect this, showing them covered with the shadows of the forest, by the sun seen through the trees, which is, like the truth, partially obscured (by the way, despite the popular opinion, this wasn't the first film to point the camera at the sun, Kurosawa did it earlier in his Stray Dog). There's a heavy downpour throughout most of the film and adds to the bleak atmosphere of the scenes at the gate. In the end, when hope for humanity is found, the sun finally appears and shines through.The performances are notably over-the-top but that's what makes them memorable, be it Noriko Honma's performance as the creepy medium, Toshirô Mifune as the maniacal bandit (Kurosawa had him act like a lion for a full effect), or Machiko Kyô as the samurai's wife (who also had a great main act as lady Wakasa in Mizoguchi's Ugetsu, another film which popularized Japanese cinema outside the country itself).

I must be one of the few people in the country to have watched this, but I'm glad that I did.I've always been a Michelle Trachtenberg fan, right since I watched 17 Again and Eurotrip. That's not just because of her adorably cute face, but also because she is a very fun and light-hearted person. When I first heard that she got her very own movie in which she starred as the main character at the age of 12 (6 years before I was born), no questions asked I went and watched that film straight away.To begin with, I was never familiar with the story of Harriet the Spy, since it's such an old series I couldn't even read by the time it was already several years old. At first, I thought it was about an actual 'child-spy' who uncovered some kind of secret plot, and I thought it was just going to be another one of those Home Alone-type movies. But when it came to watching it, I found something much, much better.Michelle's acting was amazing for a 12-year-old girl, and when she wanted to look intimidating, she looked intimidating as hell. As the story began to unravel, revealing the typical problems with friendships (just in a more exaggerated and horribly cruel way (I mean, paint buckets? That's traumatizing.)), I found myself either making an awfully loud Aww sound every few seconds or quietly sobbing as I felt sorry for Harriet.To sum the whole thing up, Harriet the Spy is a heartfelt and truly touching film with guffawing comedy, bawling drama and everything in between. For me, it wasn't just a family movie (I also watched it on my own, so that's another weird thing to add on to how I am 14 years old, at an age where no-one watches such emotional tales) it was a life lesson to helping your friends and never leaving them no matter what.

Well, 'T2' has so many that I won't go into it. This movie contains so many iconic scenes that has become an icon itself.8- So, what else? I urge all cinema fans and directors to watch this movie a zillion times as I've already done, and take notes all along. but not in order to rip-off from it as many others have done, but to learn, learn, learn, learn and learn how a movie should be done. CITIZEN KANE? You must be joking.

Everyone in the film, both the ones on screen and the ones who are simply allusions, is a perfect archetype. They are simple figures whose traits are summed up in no more than an adjective or two an alcoholic country singer, a pious and patient widow, a glitzy but troubled Opry singer. To the film's credit, its shoe fits the simplicity of the people is matched by a terseness of expression and a plain setting somewhere outside of Austin&#x97;not in one of that city's prettier Hill Country environs, either. The dialogue is especially direct in the case of the intensely personal questions that flow ceaselessly from a young boy to his widowed mother and stepfather. It's helpful, and rare for a serious drama which might be expected to strive for nuance and ambiguity, to know exactly what characters are thinking and feeling.The tradeoff is that what the characters think and feel is, to go back to this word, pretty simple. It's almost painfully uncomplicated, like a screenwriter's perception of what common, everyday folks' lives are like, but without being accidentally patronizing. The movie has no elitism, no detachment that could hint at superiority it is warm and forgiving and non-judgmental to its characters, perhaps to a fault in the case of Robert Duvall's protagonist. The movie passes lightly over his history as a domestic abuser, a fact that might not be so uncomfortable if our knowledge of the women in his life were not so filtered through his eyes. One of the best scenes in the film takes place when he is away from home for a day and a night, and his wife and stepson are left to talk to each other. Most of the time, though, we see what he sees in pretty much the way he sees it. Could our perception of the Opry singer who was his ex-wife be limited to glitzy but troubled if we saw her in the long years of her single parenthood rather than in the emotionally-fraught circumstances that are the only intersections between her and Duvall's character? Similarly, his young adult daughter is written in a way that says more about him than her, and her arc seems to exist primarily to give him a reason to comment on his arc. She is the quintessential teen trying to grow up too fast in a manner that is thought to add depth to males but bring females to tragedy, just another example of moralistic fiction trope stretching back centuries.The plotting, then, is unsatisfying, and the characters too. The acting is capable, but it's nothing mold-breaking for Duvall, who nevertheless won an Oscar for it. A generation later, the movie Crazy Heart (2009, also featuring Duvall, but in a supporting role) would take the very same subject matter and throw in a few new twists and a couple of big, chewy, Oscary scenes that won its star Jeff Bridges the same award. The music alone is a sufficient reason to watch Crazy Heart, which did for outlaw and alternative country what O Brother, Where Art Thou? (2000) did for American traditional folk. The music in Tender Mercies is also worth a listen, especially for fans of classic country in the Nashville and Bakersfield modes. The songs don't quite make it a must-see, but they are highlights of a pleasant enough hour and a half.

I find those kinds of pictures less than satisfying because they seem to cop out of a final resolution to the story. Rashomon takes a somewhat similar approach, but instead of setting up a dream narrative, Kurosawa has his characters relate the circumstances of a murder from the perspective of four different observers. I can't say that that isn't a valid approach, but the problem I have is that the characters relating their stories don't seem to have credibility on their side. If I had to make a personal judgment, I'd say the woodcutter's appraisal of events seemed most valid because he didn't have a personal stake in the outcome of a murder investigation.Looking individually at each of the players - the bandit Tajomaru (Toshiro Mifune) relates a tale that builds up his own self esteem - he valiantly fights the husband (Masayuki Mori), crossing swords with him twenty three times. The wife (Machiko Kyo) relating her version of events seems to be seeking atonement for her shame in being victimized by Tajomaru. The husband, telling his story through a medium after his death, seems willing to spare his wife the agony of betrayal and for suffering the shame of her rape. Finally, the woodcutter, who has nothing to gain by telling what he saw, except for the possible humiliation for not intervening because he was cowardly, was probably the closest to the truth about what happened.

The synopsis on the Blu-Ray case says that Three Kings is 'a surreal comedy and a powerful drama of human compassion'. That is the problem with the film, it strives to be two things at once and ultimately fails in succeeding at either.The foundations of its trite, formulaic narrative are laid in the film's early moments. Gates stresses that once they get their gold from the bunker they're getting straight out of there, but naturally their swift plan goes awry when the men's conscience throw them into a union with the noble Iraqi rebels and a bloody conflict with Saddam Hussein's army. This is second-rate Rambo territory, yet it gets over 90% on Rotten Tomatoes.There are moments of style and surrealism, for example there are several scenes that show what happens to one's innards when a bullet passes through them, the effects are terrifically grisly and macabre. The first gunfight is also in a strange, choppy slow motion that's silent apart from loud, single gunshots. However, when the tension, of which there is some I admit, is broken by the sound of American and Iraqi rifles, there is a palpable sense of safety amongst the Americans; despite the overwhelming numbers of Hussein's troops, I never felt that the Three Kings were truly in any danger. Even when Troy is captured and subjected to moments of nasty torture, I wasn't particularly bothered because I knew he'd be rescued. It is Troy's capture that, with a few exceptions, signals the steady decline of the film.Jean Baudrillard said that 'the Gulf War did not take place', referring to how the United States-led coalition engaged in a war of safe distances with vastly superior technology. Baudrillard also believed that the media coverage was mere simulacrum, a sanitised recreation of events that ignored Iraqi suffering and championed US objectives. Seasoned journalist Adriana Cruz (Nora Dunn) is a personification of this, she's depicted as being self-centred and interested only in her career rather than her subject. There's a scene where she cries at the sight of oil slathered animals, however it's quite apparent that she's really mourning the absence of a good story.Baudrillard's notions are corroborated in exchanges between Troy and Iraqi Captain Said (Said Taghmaoui) that serve as the film's main moments of war moralising. With Troy bound to a chair and wired with electric cables, Said tells him that his son died in the bombing of Baghdad, asking Troy how he'd feel if his daughter was killed in similar circumstances, a thought that he acknowledges as sheer hypothesis 'Very nice for you bro, she's safe in Arizona without the bombs and concrete'. The impact of this scene is intensified by cutaway clips that visualise their dialogue of war and death; despite Said's torture of Troy, the scene highlights fundamental similarities between the two men, giving Said humanity. Indeed, the film succeeds in giving many of the Iraqi characters a sense of identity. Despite of all this, I felt the film was following the well trodden path of Hollywood war moralising in a rather hackneyed manner.After what feels longer than 110 minutes, the film confirms just how formulaic it is when its farcical story is wrapped up so very neatly, it sucks out any modicum of credibility that may have remained. What's left is a film that is by no means terrible but a rather mediocre affair with the odd flash of political commentary and explosive spectacle that has been done better elsewhere. I shouldn't be too surprised by its mediocrity, after all who talks about Three Kings anymore?

However, do not be fooled. This film still holds on to its integrity as an action-packed crime drama just like previous Dirty Harry films. Jennifer Spencer (played by Sandra Locke) is a 30-something-year-old woman who continues to suffer from the horrendous memories of a gang rape to which she and her teenage sister fell victim at the hands of local hooligans in a California town north of San Francisco. The rape gang that attacked her and her teenage sister 10 years earlier consisted of mostly men and one woman. A major flaw can be found in humanity rather than in the movie itself when a flashback is shown where Jennifer Spencer allows herself to be talked into taking her teenage sister to a gathering below the boardwalk at a noisy amusement park. The woman-rapist who invites her to this gathering acts so touchy and pushy with her when Jennifer Spencer almost declines the invitation that the audience questions why anyone would be naive enough even to show up to such a gathering when God only knows what kind of people will be there. Jennifer Spencer is in public when this woman-rapist extends this invitation. When anybody sees this scene, everybody probably wonders why anyone in their right mind would even entertain the idea of bringing their teenage sister to a gathering of strangers who are probably just as creepy as the woman-rapist who extended the invitation. Most of us would just not show up after promising to do so, right? Well, so we tell ourselves. Nobody is perfect and most of us have been caught in a moment of weakness in one way or another no matter how aggressive we may believe ourselves to be in dealing with all the bullies of the world. Whenever we fall into trying situations, we all hate the unwelcome remarks later on from others who have never been in such situations, telling us what we could have done differently to prevent the situation from ever coming about, because reality has it that one never knows what it is like to be a victim of any kind of atrocity unless one has been a victim of one. Moreover, if Jennifer Spencer had not shown up with her teenage sister at the gathering, there would have been no movie. Anyhow, after seeing the graphic gang rape in Jennifer Spencer's flashback, most of us come to the realization that rudeness is sometimes the best defense we have against low-lifes who deserve no courtesy whatsoever regardless of how we have been brought up.What makes this movie interesting is the psychology it promotes that both rapists and former rapists who live by the misguided faith that revenge has a statute of limitations of some kind and that violent sexual assaults become things of the past after so many years are actually living in a fool's paradise for believing so. This movie shows the reality that most rape victims do not forgive nor forget such violations upon them even after the passage of one or several decades no matter how reformed their attackers may become in the future. The anger only builds up through the years to be released at a much greater magnitude than if the revenge had occurred immediately. We all sense that rage coming from Jennifer Spencer as we see her bump off her and her sister's former attackers one by one, especially when she violently blows the woman-rapist's breasts off with a shower of bullets after the woman-rapist asks her how her slut sister is doing. Even that comment alone that the woman-rapist makes about Jennifer Spencer's sister causes the audience to feel that the woman-rapist is getting exactly what she deserves and that she is just another mole being wiped off of the backside of society.The story becomes interesting when Dirty Harry and Jennifer Spencer finally meet and hook up with one another. You can't help but to sense the chemistry that exists between both of them in the form of their similar outlook on the cruel and crime-ridden world. You always get a strong feeling that Dirty Harry will be on Jennifer Spencer's side throughout her entire ordeal no matter how her situation turns out for her and no matter which side of the law she ends up on in her vendetta against the men and the one woman who had gang raped her and her sister 10 years earlier. As in previous films, Dirty Harry fears no evil no matter how sinister and diabolical of people he must confront. Every time he says, Go ahead. Make my day, you really hope that the scumbag at the other end of his gun will do something to give him a perfectly legitimate reason to shoot them into the ground.

A major flaw can be found in humanity rather than in the movie itself when a flashback is shown where Jennifer Spencer allows herself to be talked into taking her teenage sister to a gathering below the boardwalk at a noisy amusement park. The woman-rapist who invites her to this gathering acts so touchy and pushy with her when Jennifer Spencer almost declines the invitation that the audience questions why anyone would be naive enough even to show up to such a gathering when God only knows what kind of people will be there. Jennifer Spencer is in public when this woman-rapist extends this invitation. When anybody sees this scene, everybody probably wonders why anyone in their right mind would even entertain the idea of bringing their teenage sister to a gathering of strangers who are probably just as creepy as the woman-rapist who extended the invitation. Most of us would just not show up after promising to do so, right? Well, so we tell ourselves. Nobody is perfect and most of us have been caught in a moment of weakness in one way or another no matter how aggressive we may believe ourselves to be in dealing with all the bullies of the world. Whenever we fall into trying situations, we all hate the unwelcome remarks later on from others who have never been in such situations, telling us what we could have done differently to prevent the situation from ever coming about, because reality has it that one never knows what it is like to be a victim of any kind of atrocity unless one has been a victim of one. Moreover, if Jennifer Spencer had not shown up with her teenage sister at the gathering, there would have been no movie. Anyhow, after seeing the graphic gang rape in Jennifer Spencer's flashback, most of us come to the realization that rudeness is sometimes the best defense we have against low-lifes who deserve no courtesy whatsoever regardless of how we have been brought up.What makes this movie interesting is the psychology it promotes that both rapists and former rapists who live by the misguided faith that revenge has a statute of limitations of some kind and that violent sexual assaults become things of the past after so many years are actually living in a fool's paradise for believing so. This movie shows the reality that most rape victims do not forgive nor forget such violations upon them even after the passage of one or several decades no matter how reformed their attackers may become in the future. The anger only builds up through the years to be released at a much greater magnitude than if the revenge had occurred immediately. We all sense that rage coming from Jennifer Spencer as we see her bump off her and her sister's former attackers one by one, especially when she violently blows the woman-rapist's breasts off with a shower of bullets after the woman-rapist asks her how her slut sister is doing. Even that comment alone that the woman-rapist makes about Jennifer Spencer's sister causes the audience to feel that the woman-rapist is getting exactly what she deserves and that she is just another mole being wiped off of the backside of society.The story becomes interesting when Dirty Harry and Jennifer Spencer finally meet and hook up with one another. You can't help but to sense the chemistry that exists between both of them in the form of their similar outlook on the cruel and crime-ridden world. You always get a strong feeling that Dirty Harry will be on Jennifer Spencer's side throughout her entire ordeal no matter how her situation turns out for her and no matter which side of the law she ends up on in her vendetta against the men and the one woman who had gang raped her and her sister 10 years earlier. As in previous films, Dirty Harry fears no evil no matter how sinister and diabolical of people he must confront. Every time he says, Go ahead. Make my day, you really hope that the scumbag at the other end of his gun will do something to give him a perfectly legitimate reason to shoot them into the ground.

So as soon as it premiered in Liverpool my cousin and I went to see it immediately at the first-run cinema The Gaumont in Liiverpool City Centre. There it was paired with a gung-ho action movie called Mozambique and the sound was not up to standard for the start of the movie, but even these shortcomings could not detract from the fabulous experience of seeing this film. We knew all the Sgt Pepper songs off by heart and it seemed to encapsulate what the Beatles were all about at that moment in time. As for those cinema bosses in London well they were just blue meanies. Zoom to 1999 and the Liverpool re-release of the remastered film at the Philharmonic Hall. Tribute bands were playing outside the town hall and a character dressed as a Blue Meanie was walking around. I went to see the film again. It had survived all that the cinema bosses could throw at it and was louder and more colourful than ever. It is another revolutionally piece of cinema under the Beatles name and is an absolute animated classic.

This film may have some issues (mainly involving editing and a little script issue), but there is no denying the personal affection we feel for the characters as they struggle to survive. For a 1993 film, this film has some good special effects as the plane crash was very convincing.Frank Marshall's film is about the fore-mentioned crash in the Andes and it talks about how these men survived in the harsh winter environment with nothing but chocolate and wine. Later on, the film goes on to mention the last resort effort in cannibalism to stay alive, which is really hard to watch even though this is what saved their lives.For a film that doesn't have a big-name cast, the acting was really good and they all added depth to their characters. The only familiar names are Ethan Hawke and Vincent Spano. I really valued Hawke's character, Nando because of his bravery as he went out to find civilization.Overall, Alive is a movie that does the unthinkable and effectively tells an unfilmable event into a harrowing, emotional story. This film has one of the best endings you'll ever see in film, and it will be difficult to hold back the tears while Aaron Neville's Ave Maria, is performing.

Harrelson's character is a man who does everything in his power to innovate and provoke the society, in order to expand the idea that we can't just accept what people say to us; we have to use our minds and do what we feel like doing, as long as it doesn't negatively affect other people's lives-- and that's an ideology I've always agreed with.

One sad thing I have to admit is that I actually LAUGHED at her behavior; I mean, she looked so junkie and crazy, mainly in the court scenes, that it felt absurd to see her that way. The juridical aspect of the movie isn't very elaborated or analyzed, given that the dramatical aspects of Flint's life are more in evidence than anything else.
