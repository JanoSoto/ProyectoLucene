He eventually comes to a cabin, or something like that, and once inside it he faints and ultimately goes into another of his famous comas. Thanks to the resident hermit, Michael gets plenty of rest for a whole year...Now telepathically linked to her uncle, young Jamie(now mute and unable to make use of her vocal cords)waits anxiously in Haddonfield Children's Hospital, exactly one year later. She knows that her uncle is coming, but cannot express herself with speech. Thankfully Dr. Loomis is still around, and he senses that Jamie knows something but believes that she is protecting Michael. Jamie's sister Rachel(Ellie Cornell)reprises her role for about ten minutes, unfortunately, since Michael eventually kills her in one of the many well-directed scenes in this installment. Replacing her is Tina(Wendy Kaplan), the widely hated bad actress who I actually kinda liked. Aside from being a bit annoying, I still don't think that she was as bad as some of the buffoons from part six...Anyways, I used to believe that Halloween 5The Revenge of Michael Myers was superior to its predecessor. However, having recently watched the two back to back, I realize that I was wrong about that. This sequel still has some redeeming qualities, though. While part four delivered some great scare scenes, director Othenin-Girard capitalizes on this formula and delivers even better scares this time. Examples are the aforementioned death scene with Rachel, the chase scene with Jamie in the hospital's basement, the car-chase scene with Tina, and a very suspenseful scene with Jamie in the Myers's laundry chute. In fact, every scene that takes place in the Myers house is superb. Overall I rate Halloween 5 a 7\/10. Some of the editing and voice-overs were absolutely awful so I had to take away a point. Other than that I think that this installment is at least worth a viewing, and the ending will certainly leave you craving more. Too bad we had to wait about six years for another one, and sadly Danielle Harris(who plays Jamie in four and five)does not return. So, to end this, part five is at least better than the next sequel, Halloween 6The Curse of Michael Myers.

Although they did serve a purpose in showing Vincent early on, that he could beat the odds regardless of what he was always made to believe. Nonetheless, I think this film is a masterpiece because of its intelligent and nuanced script. For instance, the method of recruitment by means of genetic analysis is not legal in the near future that GATTACA depicts, but that doesn't mean it isn't used by employers. There is no formal distinction between the upper and lower class, but there is a practical one. The writer didn't take the whole concept and implementation of genetic discrimination too far, he didn't make things outrageous. And that's where the strength lies.

Her driver stops at an odd location on Mulholland Drive, which is a twisting, thickly wooded two-lane road full of mansions overlooking Los Angeles. Just as her driver and another man in the passenger seat turn around to kill her, two drag racing cars from the opposite direction come crashing into the limo. Only the dark-haired woman survives. She works her way down the ridge to Sunset Boulevard and hides in a vacationing woman's apartment. Shortly after, Betty (Naomi Watts), the vacationing woman's niece, shows up at the apartment and runs into the dark haired woman, who now has amnesia. The bulk of the first part of the film is Betty and the dark haired woman trying to figure out who she is, why people were trying to kill her and why she had thousands of dollars and a strange key in her purse. This is interspersed with oddly surreal threads about Hollywood producers and directors, with occasional forays into a land of hoodlums and prostitutes.The above may sound a bit complicated and disjointed, but that's not the half of it. The film is constructed so that the meaning will always be open to interpretation. It's basically guaranteed that you will not understand this film and you will not have very much confidence arriving at your own interpretation the first time around. Even if you have a lot of experience with like-minded films--such as Memento (2000), Donnie Darko (2001), The I Inside (2003) and The Butterfly Effect (2004)--you may not understand it on a second viewing, either. The studio was aware of this to the extent that they had director David Lynch write 10 clues to unlocking this thriller and they put it on the back of the chapter listing insert in the DVD. Lynch being of a particular disposition, these clues are almost as cryptic as the film itself. It doesn't help when trying to figure it out in the early stages that the structure is extremely complex. It takes a very long time to figure out what parts are supposed to be real and there is a complex nesting of flashbacks in some sections, with only contextual clues that they're flashbacks.But is the film worth watching, or worth trying to figure out? That depends on your tastes, obviously. On a surface level, the film is certainly attractive if you are a fan of surrealism, although it will tend to seem a bit slow and overly disjointed to some viewers. But those qualities, and many other surrealist aspects of the film, are typical of Lynch. A prime Lynchian moment is the old couple in the beginning bizarrely smiling almost as if they're alien pod people trying to put on a front. If you're familiar with that style and like it, you'll find much to love here, although in many ways, Mulholland Drive is fairly understated for Lynch. It's also worth noting, for viewers who'll primarily be interested in it or who enjoy it just as much as other aspects, that Mulholland Drive has a quite steamy lesbian scene. It's not gratuitous, although I have no problems with gratuitousness, but is instead an important hinge in the film.Like all of Lynch's films, it's easy to become enraptured in his unique approach to every aspect of filmic art and his attention to detail. Any serious student of film (including armchair students\/cinephiles) should study Mulholland Drive; many will love it. Lynch doesn't let anything pass unmanipulated. He includes brilliant color schemes (such as the plethora of reds and pinks) with important symbolism. He makes unusual use of sound, such as the ringing telephone carrying over into the section of score that follows it (when Betty first arrives at the airport). He directs his actors to deliver their lines in a plethora of bizarre ways, such as his characteristic odd pauses. He lets his odd and surprising sense of humor poke through, such as the name Winkie's, and the Hot Dogs--made for Pinks sign that provides a clue to some of the color symbolism.Lynch's attention to detail in production design provides important, subtle clues throughout the film to help one unlock the meaning. It's interesting to note that Lynch even apparently demands that the DVD programming be unusual--there are no chapters on the disc; you must either watch the film in real time or fast forward or rewind to get back to particular points.If the surrealism and veiled meaning of the film are attractive to you, or if you're just fond of puzzles, then Mulholland Drive is well worth watching for that aspect. There is a fairly accepted interpretation of the film, at least on a broad, generalized level. I won't recount the standard interpretation here--it is worth researching, but only after you've seen the film a couple times and have reached your own conclusions. Many articles and monographs have been written on the film and interpretations; there are even websites dedicated to it.For my money, however, although I generally love Lynch and find many things about Mulholland Drive attractive, it is not quite a 10 for me, at least not yet (I have a feeling that my score could still rise on subsequent viewings). To me, though, the twist aspect of the film is done much better in other works such as The I Inside and The Butterfly Effect. Mulholland Drive is more attractive to me for its surface surrealistic touches, but the plot doesn't carry them as well as some of Lynch's other films.Still, Mulholland Drive is certainly recommended for the right crowd.

I expected a dull movie, not something so dreadful. Rollerball has all the elements to make one of those bizarre cult classics from the 70's and 80's. Except the fun element.The movie starts with the worst police chase in years. Believe me, any Lorenzo Lamas movie, even one featuring appearances from Dolph Lundgren, can be capable of a car chase better than this we see Chris Klein running from police in a mix of skateboard and racing-car, in San Francisco. Then, helped by his friend LL Cool J., he goes to an Asiatic country. There, the most popular game is the Rollerball, a mix of basketball and roller-skating that seems to be deadly and a great money-maker. Rollerball is controlled by Jean Reno's character, the average mad-business-man stereotype.

Some compare it to Shakespeare's Tempest, but this is a stretch, and, in some ways, an insult to the scifi genre. Stripped of what makes it a scifi film, sure, its The Tempest, but how many hundreds of films can you say something similar about? Underneath, this is a cautionary tale about progress and technology and the social evolution necessary for its appropriate and safe use. Yet the film still proceeds with all the hopefulness for our future that we have come to expect from shows like Star Trek.Anne Francis is not the only reason why this film is best described as beautiful. The special effects, and even the aesthetics of the backdrops are powerful enough to make the uninspired directing and uneven acting almost unnoticeable. If it were not for the goofy retro-art-deco-ness of 1950s sci-fi props, you might think you were watching a 1960s piece.This is a classic of that very special sub-genre of sci fi I like to call 1950s sci-fi, and, though not, in my opinion, the best it is certainly a must see for anybody interested in sci-fi film and special effects. The clever plot, now rendered trite by its reuse in six or seven episodes of Star Trek, Lost in Space, and even Farscape, is worth paying attention to, and will sustain the interest of most scifi fans. Trekkers will be particularly interested in the various aspects of the film which seem to have inspired themes of Star Trek's original series aired about 12 years later, though they may find themselves disappointed by the (relatively mild) 1950s sexism and the lack of any kind of racial integration. While I do not mean to nitpick, the lack of social progress manifest in this film was the one major problem I had with it. Some will probably see this film simply to catch a glimpse of young, good-looking Leslie Nielsen in one of his first starring roles. Unfortunately, Nielsen's performance is only average, and at times down-right poor (especially at the climax of the film).

There are so many comments written on this site but I found it necessary to make my voice heard. I am an EXTREMELY open-minded movie viewer. --mild spoilers ahead---- but please continue readingAs an aspiring director, I understand that ugliness and sadness are two very powerful emotions to use to get your point across. This film indeed shows the vile and disgusting sexual habits of people. However, it makes no attempt to justify what is seen, nor does it come to any conclusion concerning the sick and twisted habits. From domestic abuse, pedophilia, the desire to be raped, and other human ugliness, Happiness has easily become the worst movie I have ever seen...ever. When it was finished I actually had to sit and talk to my friends and explain why this film bothered me so much, just so I could carry on with my day.

Sounds both original and strange doesn't it? The American Astronaut proves to be both of these (and strange definitely in a good way, believe me).The story is centred around space trader Samuel Curtis (played by writer and director Cory McAbee), who we find in a bar on an asteroid belt, landing in order to make a deal. The scene in the bar is extremely funny, and introduces us to the fact that this is partly a musical. In the bar, unbeknownst to Curtis, is his intermittently-reoccurring nemesis, Professor Hess. Hess, a psychotic killer, pursues Curtis throughout his subsequent journey, in which he performs a number of deals, culminating in travelling to Venus to provide a suitable male to the women of Venus, in order that they release the body of their late suitor, Johnny R), and the dialogue between the two is one of the highlights of the film.This film is stylishly shot in black and white, and Cory McAbee manages to convey the idea of outer space extraordinarily well with some simple direction. Especially impressive is the collage of still photographs showing Curtis explaining why Professor Hess is in his pursuit - it is funny, original, and ingeniously simple. Shot on a low budget, this film does not suffer from the fact in any way. McAbee's use of light and shadows is reminiscent of Orson Welles' direction in Citizen Kane - simple, but astonishingly effective.With a superb soundtrack from McAbee's band The Billy Nayer Show, and the script as impressive as the direction, the film's slightly abrupt ending is the only chink in this otherwise flawless masterpiece; although even that has an upside, in that it leaves you wishing to hear more of Samuel Curtis, and the others.Hopefully more from the same director will do.
