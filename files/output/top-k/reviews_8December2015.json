The stock high school comedy characters all all here; the hyperactive know it all student, the dumb quarterback, the moody depressed teen, the nerds, the creepy teacher. At first I found it hilarious that the teacher's face would be the one crumpled up in tears (and there is a great bit of misdirection with the loopy handwritten love note), but also surprising that the roles had been reversed and the adult had becomes the perceived victim (later we learn that Dave was a frequent bed wetter, even more prominently displaying this theme). But we trust what is supposedly Broderick's character, the good natured history teacher Jim, because his voice-over sounds so soothing, so mature. The slight of hand is gradual. Opposing him we have the bane of every teacher's existence, the enthusiastic Tracy Enid Flick, who busts up and down and on the spot at every question, hand firmly thrust up in the air. As if that was not annoying enough, it's even suggested that Jim blames her for seducing his former best friend, and is anxious that he is her next target, which is visualised by these seductive whispers in his mind, and speaks a lot more of him than her. Another technique that Payne likes to use is the sudden freeze frame, which warps Tracy's facial mannerisms into something ugly and demeaning, no doubt the same process that is churning away in Jim's mind, and dismissed her speech. Reese Witherspoon's performance is perfect - she toes the line between enthusiastic and annoying, but that line itself is warped from Broderick's perspective, and little actions become large annoyances. The screenplay is based on Tom Perrotta's novel, but Payne's vision is so much more appropriate for showing us just how lively these characters are. When Tracy first discovers Paul's campaign for student council, the soundtrack flares up like some Spaghetti Western with Morricone's Navajo Joe, and it is clear just how little she is used to being challenged, and Witherspoon's voice-over and the music both speed up in intensity as her angers grows. The same soundtrack later slows to a grinding halt as Jim proposes the widow Linda, and we like her are incredulous that our good guy image has been shattered. Broderick's stupid little grin is telling; he shoots for the little pleasures, and daydreams incessantly - in a green-screen sequence, he imagines himself driving a luxury Italian car, before the graceful backing track stops as he steps out onto the school parking lot. And on the pivotal election day, the music is once again key, the slow beats of the bass drum providing tension that would not be out of place before a large scale battle in some war film. Tracy seems to think so. We have the naivety of the teenagers pronounced via voice-over, with a complete sincerity that makes it funny but also a bit sad; Tracy insisting that she does not miss a father figure before perfectly describing one in Dave, Tammy musing on how she's not a lesbian even though every single one of her love interests have been female, Paul's various good natured ramblings about others and the gift of his penis...and of course his monotone, face- down speech delivered without an ounce of showmanship that Tracy possesses, but which Jim eagerly applauds anyway. And after it all? He is barely affected by the whole ordeal and has an awesome senior year. An early scene has Jim absent-mindedly tossing the food of his colleagues out of the teacher's fridge, with even less care for where it lands, splattering sauce onto the floor as the janitor shakes his head. Later, the same janitor is part of the visual assault on Jim as the cuts between their dead-straight stares speedily bore into Jim's conscience. Election's triumph is that it almost manages to make us feel a little for him; the breakdown of his marriage, the bee sting, the fury at Tracy's little celebration victory dance. And as he narrates his new life at the close, his happiness at being an educator, the new woman, and the modest yet lovable apartment, we think he is well adjusted, and content, and we are instinctively drawn to movie endings like this one. And he almost manages to fool us with his voice-over, his disappearance of contempt for Tracy Enid Flick. And for what? For tearing down a poster and denying it? For aiming further and higher than Jim will ever experience? His crusade becomes so sad and funny as he flees the scene, but I'm sure in his mind he has won.

After that, he starts to doubt his life. Finally he figures out that everything around him is very strange.

This was just released on Blu Ray; I purchased it with great trepidation. I had already been let down by some of the other prehistoric 'classics' that older relatives have enshrined as 'immortal treasures.' First, the invisibility effects are quite well done there are only a few shots of Rains talking where the camera is inexplicably shooting up into the bandages and we can clearly see his nose and jaw bone beneath the coverings. I only detected wires in the moving bicycle scene and a couple of heavy objects being levitated. On the whole, given that it is over eighty years old; the effects will surprise you. The reason I own the movie is Claude Rains; his performance here is the star of this movie. All he has to work with, as he becomes more and more murderously psychotic, is his voice tone. Think of the difficulty and if you want to appreciate this reading watch the dreadfully bad Memoirs Of An Invisible Man that even John Carpenter could not save. The contrast is due completely to the differential in acting ability between Claude Rains and Chevy Chase. Even with far superior effects, Chase could not modulate and use emotion in his voice tone to convey his personality. Chase's performance is why that movie is so obscure and this one a legend.Rains is able to truly scare with his voice and violence; I concur with the above reviewer, a little of Uma O' Connor goes a long way but she is here for comic relief. She bullies and pushes her poor husband all about shrieking and yelling. This is the only old 'classic' horror movie that I kept. The other ones just didn't do anything for me. Rains' delineation begins as slightly odd progressing to increasingly dangerous. This is spread over the short length of the movie giving realism to the depiction. Those who have read Plato's Republic, know that the Ring Of Glaucon was the center of a moral dispute with Socrates arguing that morality would be unchanged. This movie vaults over the issue, addressed better in Hollow Man, by blaming the rare drug for causing the murderous psychosis that Rains transforms into. The print was a little bad in spots, as you might imagine, but nothing like I Married A Witch which was fifty dollars on Blu Ray and unwatchable. Here, it has brightness and debris issues but is still worth the purchase. This is the peril of buying movies from the thirties; the terrible state of the prints after nearly a century.If you enjoy Claude Rains, as I do, you will want this in your inventory. He is so young here but his skill is just as powerful as it was in his tiny final roles like Lawrence Of Arabia. The supporting cast is quite good with some strong English actors giving good balance to Rains' craziness. The shortness of the movie is actually a big plus. It runs so quickly with hardly any boring development like we got in Memoirs. When the movie begins, he is seeking refuge in a snowstorm already transformed into the invisible man covered in bandages. For all the attacks on Uma, I found Stuart to be histrionic at times, yet this is the culture of movies back here. She doesn't swoon, as is a standard staple of movies from the 30's, but she does work herself up into hysterics. Uma serves to lighten the movie from its quite dark tone for the period.

Was it bad? No. Did it make a huge positive impact to the franchise? Not really. Don't get me wrong, it is not horrible, but there some major flaws and obvious inferiorities, when compared to the classic.As much as i hate to admit this, i didn't enjoy Hannibal Lecter nearly as much as when he was imprisoned and seemingly incapable of doing anything. His dominant demeanor in The Silence of the Lambs just made him look like a god, he was like an indestructible master of manipulation, here he doesn't lose his appearance completely, but he seems a lot more vulnerable and at some parts i just couldn't believe how easily it was for his rivals to trick him, it just isn't relatable to his character. This film used gore in excess, in my opinion, it wasn't as elegant as its prequel, using gore is not necessarily a bad thing to do, just Hannibal Lecter was portrayed differently before so it does not quite fit. The film had many movie making flaws and illogical actions, that were quite annoying and obvious, but i would like to put that aside, because it was more important to see how the things unfold rather than pointing out the flaws. A huge upset is Jodie Foster not returning to play Clarice, not that Julianne Moore was horrible, it just is not the same, Foster was just loved and praised for her role in The Silence of the Lambs, so that's a slight downgrade. Anthony Hopkins himself was great as Hannibal Lecter, even though as i mentioned above, i didn't enjoy Hannibal Lecter's character here as much as i did before, i still think Hopkins was outstanding in this movie.Unfortunately, this is another case when the sequel of a classic blockbuster movie doesn't come close to its original. I can guarantee you if there never was The Silence of the Lambs, just Hannibal this movie would have a much higher rating than 6.7, at least 7.5. I admit it is a huge concern for me as well and i base my judgement highly on whether the second installment out shined the first or not.

Don't get me wrong, it is not horrible, but there some major flaws and obvious inferiorities, when compared to the classic.As much as i hate to admit this, i didn't enjoy Hannibal Lecter nearly as much as when he was imprisoned and seemingly incapable of doing anything. His dominant demeanor in The Silence of the Lambs just made him look like a god, he was like an indestructible master of manipulation, here he doesn't lose his appearance completely, but he seems a lot more vulnerable and at some parts i just couldn't believe how easily it was for his rivals to trick him, it just isn't relatable to his character. This film used gore in excess, in my opinion, it wasn't as elegant as its prequel, using gore is not necessarily a bad thing to do, just Hannibal Lecter was portrayed differently before so it does not quite fit. The film had many movie making flaws and illogical actions, that were quite annoying and obvious, but i would like to put that aside, because it was more important to see how the things unfold rather than pointing out the flaws. A huge upset is Jodie Foster not returning to play Clarice, not that Julianne Moore was horrible, it just is not the same, Foster was just loved and praised for her role in The Silence of the Lambs, so that's a slight downgrade. Anthony Hopkins himself was great as Hannibal Lecter, even though as i mentioned above, i didn't enjoy Hannibal Lecter's character here as much as i did before, i still think Hopkins was outstanding in this movie.Unfortunately, this is another case when the sequel of a classic blockbuster movie doesn't come close to its original. I can guarantee you if there never was The Silence of the Lambs, just Hannibal this movie would have a much higher rating than 6.7, at least 7.5. I admit it is a huge concern for me as well and i base my judgement highly on whether the second installment out shined the first or not.

In how-to-draw portrait books, we are taught to start with sketched lines to define a classic head shape, then to divide the face into perfectly even segments &#x96; few people in real life actually fit those idealised proportions, however Kate Beckinsale does &#x96; and she has never been more lovingly photographed than in this movie.Along with her polished English accent, and her understated style, she is a disarming package. It actually makes believable that John Cusack's Jonathon would keep her memory fresh after meeting her for only one night five years before.Cusack is interesting for other reasons. There always seems to be something else going on beneath that somewhat cynical surface. I'm not sure romantic comedy is as natural for him as it is for her. He seems more defined by edgier fare such as The Grifters or The Frozen Ground. However, that may be just the right energy for this role because for much of the film Jonathan is engaged to another woman while desperately seeking Sara.The production is a stylish one, and exudes a romantic quality. If there is a disappointment it is that genuinely witty lines are a little hard to come by in Serendipity.Normally a comedy can get a lot of mileage out of best man speeches, but the one delivered by Jeremy Pivan's character is a bit of a misfire. Other lines although milked hard, don't quite make it.Fortunately, the scene where Jonathan encounters the sales clerk played by Eugene Levy delivers laughs lacking in other places &#x96; sales clerks, whether acid tongued, prissy or totally obsequious, rarely fail to get laughs in comedies, especially when in the hands of expert practitioners such as W.C. Fields, Paul Lynde or Larry Miller in Pretty Woman.Serendipity doesn't quite line up with my personal favourites of the genre Four Weddings and a Funeral, Sleepless in Seattle and You've Got Mail.

He proved his premise They don't look like soldiers, they don't act like soldiers, why should they be expected to fight like them? To his detractors, I say, you are applying your norms of behavior to a man who saw beyond battles to the entire campaign; he appears cruel to people who are alien to the Warrior ethos.

Ambulance chasing Boston shyster Jan Slick Schlichtmann, John Travolta, gets himself involved in a toxic waste dumping case that over the last 30 years has cost a number of children in the small town of Woburn MA. to come down and die of deadly leukemia. At first not all that eager to take the case Jan soon, by checking out the dumping of toxins in a local river, smells big bucks and decides to file a major law suite against the small tanning company own by multi billion Beatricefoods and W.R Grace Chemical for major damages to the people of the town.Right from the start W. R Grace was willing to make an out of court settlement with Jan for a cool 20 million but not apologize publicly for it's actions that leads to a falling out among some of Jan's clients. Who then, against the strong advice of his fellow firm of lawyers, Jan goes the whole nine yards despite the obstacles he faces in going on trial. That in the end leads to a costly victory for him where he ends up going bankrupt together with the members of his three man law firm. It was defense lawyer Jerome Facher, Robert Duvall, who's endless and expensive holding actions in court that left Jan's law firm not only bankrupt but in debt for some 8 million dollars. The saving grace to Jan's self made financial disaster was that finally someone who worked at the tanning plant was willing to talk and thus bail him out of the mess he made for himself.*****SPOILERS**** After almost two hours of suffering through the movie a happy ending was finally on the horizon but by then nobody really seems to care not even thous involved in the law suite. You had to have a Harvard as well as Yale law degree to even grasp what the movie was all about in just how complicated it was with its endless court scenes that never seemed to go anywhere. It was good that in the end justice was done but even those who benefited from it like the major complaint in the case Anne Anderson,Kathleen Quinlan, seemed to have lost, like those of us watching, all interest in it! There's also a pre Sopranos James Gandolfini as W. R Grace employee Al, the father of 8 children, Love who among others breaks the case wide open by finally admitting that the company he works for has been responsible for polluting the countryside and poisoning the people. As for the spaced out looking Al he looked as if he himself was poisoned or on drugs in showing almost no emotion, like a Zombie, in almost all the scenes that he was in!

Why was the film so long? In my view an obsession with minutiae. From what I've read, the film is more historically accurate than most such epics. But did we need so much detail? Does the detail get in the way of telling a good story? Despite a near obsession with Elizabeth Taylor in the early 1960s, this is just too long. It's a good example of when less actually improves understanding. I understand that there was some thought of dividing this into 2 films -- the first about Cleopatra and Julius Caesar, the second about Cleopatra and Mark Antony; in my view, that would have been the perfect solution, particularly because the film divides so perfectly upon Caesar's death and the ascension of Antony, and in approximately equal lengths.The second negative is Richard Burton's acting. Particularly when being expansive, Burton's style of acting probably worked very well on stage where one needs top be heard, but it doesn't work so well on film where one need not yell. Yelling rarely equals good acting.However, aside from those two downers, there's a lot of great stuff here. For one, it's a lush production...in fact, you can't help but wonder if the real historical settings looked anywhere near this good. The costumes, particularly Elizabeth Taylor's, are stunning.The rest of the acting -- aside from some of Burton's -- is top notch. This may be Taylor's pinnacle, although it's doubtful Cleopatra looked anything like Elizabeth Taylor. And it occurred to me -- could the leader of Rome and the Queen of Egypt communicate so easily in their different languages? I was more interested in the acting by Rex Harrison. I saw Harrison perform at the Kennedy Center one year, and believe it or not, I could barely hear him even though we were sitting in center-orchestra. Even the Washington Post noted the issue in their review of the play. So, I would have to say that film was more conducive to Harrison's talents...and here, he is superb. And I mean really superb. He dies almost exactly half way through the film, and it occurred to me that the studio could have easily divided the film into two parts, which was actually considered, and they would have made twice the profit by releasing them separately. At any rate, despite enjoying Harrison's performance immensely, I was sorely disappointed in the scenes relating to the assassination of Caesar. Instead of in real time, the event is seen -- without speech -- through the eyes of a fortune teller. Harrison was robbed of the dialog in what could have been his best scene.I have never been impressed with Roddy McDowall, and was not here in his role as Octavian.Although it was not a large part, I particularly enjoyed the role played by the wonderful Hume Cronyn. And it was interesting to see Carroll O'Connor in a very different role than Archie Bunker -- as a Roman senator. Martin Landau, whom I generally did not care for, was very good here as an officer under Caesar and Marc Antony.The first half of this film relies on superb acting by Elizabeth Taylor and Rex Harrison. The second half of this film relies on superb acting by Elizabeth Taylor and the drama of Marc Antony's spiraling descent toward death.On balance, a good film, although just for the record -- odd how almost all the Egyptians were White people!

The Patriot is a jumbled, uncoordinated mess without a sense of moral ambiguity that insults the memory of American soldiers who gave their lives for a coordinated cause. It also attributes Nazi mannerisms to the British, led by Colonel William Tavington, who is portrayed by Jason Isaacs.The plot is as similar to other Roland Emmerich productions (Godzilla, Independence Day, 10,000 B.C.) as it is insultingly simple. A colonial man named Benjamin Martin (played by Mel Gibson) is beset with disaster (the Revolutionary War), and must face it bravely, lest he lose his life as well. In the view of some, this is more of a disaster movie (both figuratively and literally) than a war movie, because Emmerich chooses to place the focus of the nearly 3-hour-long movie on the atrocities (most of which are apocryphal) committed by the British rather than the struggle of the well-meaning protagonist. In reality, church burnings by the British never occurred, there is no evidence Banastre Tarleton (renamed as Tavington in the movie and portrayed by Jason Isaacs) ever broke war rules and shot a child in cold blood, and prisoners of war were never needlessly shot down. This movie also decides that the character shouldn't own slaves (so why choose the location of South Carolina?), or it would make him look bad. This film decides to put big- budget profitability instead of historical accuracy, and hence fails to provide a proper story.Interspersed throughout the movie are various hilarious segments meant to provide comic relief from a serious topic. Fake black teeth, a well- dressed Frenchman, a young lady's deaf father (who wasn't on the screen long enough to provide us anything to laugh at) and Gibson's children, offer nothing more than a simple pleasantry to distract us from Gibson mutilating a corpse with a tomahawk. However this comic relief is misplaced and takes away from the harsh realities of war. While all this may offer half a chuckle at best, one cannot miss the main problem with The Patriot it follows a familiar storyline with monotonous characters whose struggles are too clichéd for us to sympathize with them. Additionally, the actors in this movie are curt and apathetic - e.g when a character dies, a potentially emotional and powerful scene ends up becoming a jumbled mess of pointless reassurances and quick recovery . Gibson's performance is not only limited by his monotonous drone in place of much needed emotion, but also hindered by a mediocre script and a too-liberal Americanized accent. However, his is not the only reviled performance. Heath Ledger is apparently sparing his talent for a later movie, as he seems to act uninterested in the production as well. Ironically, the only decent performance in this film was that of Jason Isaacs's, whose character was basically reduced to nothing but a cartoony bad guy left hopelessly for the audience to hate. The movie doesn't care to focus on character development and emotions as much as it does on glorifying its special effects and slapping on a story at the end. Artistically, it provides nothing of significant merit whatsoever. For those who are looking for a film studio's excuse to show off their excellent CGI and special effects, this movie will suit their purposes. However, if you appreciate a truly compelling story, studded with wisdom, historical accuracy and a powerful message like I do, then let this disaster blow over without your help.

However, if you're deep into cars as a fascination, you presumably not only want one or two cars, you want several, and you want them customized and rigged to your liking. Customizing and optimizing the performance on one car is grossly expensive, but having a garage of half a dozen or more customized\/optimized vehicles could cost as much as your house and your neighbor's houses put together. This is why, each and every day, I'm more and more satisfied with my lack of interest in cars and my own obsession with the Honda Accord I drive.The Fast and the Furious also gives gearheads that kind of adrenaline rush and visualization of their dreams realized because they, themselves, often don't have the means, the vehicles, nor the kind of closed-range courses to carry out the kind of eye-popping stunts and mayhem the characters in these films cause. It caters to that level of unbridled excitement, when you're actually racing in a vehicle and that moment where you get that indescribable pang in your chest reminding you know that you're alive. I was fully ready to embrace this franchise for its fantastical elements, but unsure if I could still be entertained watching car chases and death-defying stunts for an upwards of two hours.What's pleasant about The Fast and the Furious is that it focuses on the relationships the characters have with one another in the midst of all the racing.

Led by Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), a suave know-it-all when it comes to vehicles, the gang is known for their heavily armed carjacking activities of large eighteen wheelers, in addition to their work at auto-body shops where they modify and customize cars, some of which flirting with and others unabashedly breaking the laws of what is street legal. Also working in Dom's crew are Leticia Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez), his longtime girlfriend and mechanic at his shop, in addition to his sister Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster), whom becomes the apple of Brian's eye late in the film.Brian's infiltration of Dom's ring soon becomes corrupted by his fascination with the culture Dom and his crew have created; it's a culture that specializes in prompting and maintaining a longterm adrenaline rush in the most unique and heart-pounding ways. Despite Brian's responsibility to uphold the law through all this, he finds his involvement with Dom going above and beyond the call of the law, as far as hooking up with Dom's sister and helping Dom plot a crackdown of former partners that have turned into rival gangmembers following a reneged agreement.No matter which way you slice it, The Fast and the Furious is slight in substance, but often very strong on a level of entertainment. At only one-hundred minutes, it pleasantly skates by without being too much of an assault on the senses and operates largely on the charm and infectious personalities of its actors. Walker is the standout of the crowd, maintaining a certain level of cool and street-smarts and his character never hitting the level of cocksure confidence, making him a more watchable and likable presence. That's not to undermine Diesel's role here, because without him, this film wouldn't be as much of a bromance as it already is. From the first race, it is clear that Walker and Diesel have enough chemistry to create a bond between two opposite characters in terms of life paths in order to go on many more adventures with one another. The supporting cast of Rodriguez and Brewster are fine, though even in more masculine roles, the two feel like nothing more than decorative pieces of eye-candy that help further the plot along when convenient.But perhaps such was just destined to be the case in The Fast and the Furious, a film where escapist tendencies take over and nothing else matters besides the moment when your car begins to redline or a part becomes misplaced in Dom's garage of odds and ends. Being that this film largely predicates itself on male bonding and the thrill of racing from both an illegal and adrenaline-charged angle, The Fast and the Furious largely possesses a homey quality that makes it believable and grounded in reality, despite a certain conclusion with a certain train that, I confess, was still entertaining in the realm of cinematic incredulity. This is a fun and effective film in being every gearhead's fantasy and being a damn fine piece of entertainment.Starring Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, and Jordana Brewster.

Directed by Rob Cohen. ","genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller"},{"date":"8 December 2015","score":"","review":" The Fast and the Furious is, at the very least, an intriguing franchise, for it gives gearheads the kind of inspiration and fantasy they need to have to keep sane. I've always found car hobbyists to face quite the paradox; the problem with cars is that they are grossly expensive, so if you're a middle class man, having two is quite the luxury. However, if you're deep into cars as a fascination, you presumably not only want one or two cars, you want several, and you want them customized and rigged to your liking. Customizing and optimizing the performance on one car is grossly expensive, but having a garage of half a dozen or more customized\/optimized vehicles could cost as much as your house and your neighbor's houses put together. This is why, each and every day, I'm more and more satisfied with my lack of interest in cars and my own obsession with the Honda Accord I drive.The Fast and the Furious also gives gearheads that kind of adrenaline rush and visualization of their dreams realized because they, themselves, often don't have the means, the vehicles, nor the kind of closed-range courses to carry out the kind of eye-popping stunts and mayhem the characters in these films cause. It caters to that level of unbridled excitement, when you're actually racing in a vehicle and that moment where you get that indescribable pang in your chest reminding you know that you're alive. I was fully ready to embrace this franchise for its fantastical elements, but unsure if I could still be entertained watching car chases and death-defying stunts for an upwards of two hours.What's pleasant about The Fast and the Furious is that it focuses on the relationships the characters have with one another in the midst of all the racing. The film's slender plot revolves around Brian O'Connors (Paul Walker), an undercover Los Angeles police officer sent to infiltrate a ring of truck hijackers and street racers in the heart of L.A.. Led by Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), a suave know-it-all when it comes to vehicles, the gang is known for their heavily armed carjacking activities of large eighteen wheelers, in addition to their work at auto-body shops where they modify and customize cars, some of which flirting with and others unabashedly breaking the laws of what is street legal. Also working in Dom's crew are Leticia Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez), his longtime girlfriend and mechanic at his shop, in addition to his sister Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster), whom becomes the apple of Brian's eye late in the film.Brian's infiltration of Dom's ring soon becomes corrupted by his fascination with the culture Dom and his crew have created; it's a culture that specializes in prompting and maintaining a longterm adrenaline rush in the most unique and heart-pounding ways. Despite Brian's responsibility to uphold the law through all this, he finds his involvement with Dom going above and beyond the call of the law, as far as hooking up with Dom's sister and helping Dom plot a crackdown of former partners that have turned into rival gangmembers following a reneged agreement.No matter which way you slice it, The Fast and the Furious is slight in substance, but often very strong on a level of entertainment. At only one-hundred minutes, it pleasantly skates by without being too much of an assault on the senses and operates largely on the charm and infectious personalities of its actors. Walker is the standout of the crowd, maintaining a certain level of cool and street-smarts and his character never hitting the level of cocksure confidence, making him a more watchable and likable presence. That's not to undermine Diesel's role here, because without him, this film wouldn't be as much of a bromance as it already is. From the first race, it is clear that Walker and Diesel have enough chemistry to create a bond between two opposite characters in terms of life paths in order to go on many more adventures with one another. The supporting cast of Rodriguez and Brewster are fine, though even in more masculine roles, the two feel like nothing more than decorative pieces of eye-candy that help further the plot along when convenient.But perhaps such was just destined to be the case in The Fast and the Furious, a film where escapist tendencies take over and nothing else matters besides the moment when your car begins to redline or a part becomes misplaced in Dom's garage of odds and ends.

I've never been compelled before, but thought I'd register my disgust with this Bond title.I am a huge Bond fan. Grew up watching them and always find time to re-watch, especially when the latest flick hits the theatres. When I judge a Bond film, there are certain criteria I use to assess. Vehicles, gadgets, villains, girls, comedy, locations, plot, Bond himself and the direction to name a few.Diamonds Are Forever fails on almost everyone of these. The lack of vehicles and gadgets gets to me, but the casting for Blofeld was terrible. For starters, he's not bald, he's not menacing and he's just weak all round. When Sean Connery quit the role after You Only Live Twice, who would have thought we would have seen him back? I, personally liked George Lazenby's performance as Bond and enjoyed OHMSS. But this film was just one too many for Connery, and for me, ruined his legacy somewhat. It only cost the producers a whopping $1.25m for his services. He failed to live up to expectations.Guy Hamilton took the directors chair following; possibly the best Bond film ever in Goldfinger, his work here was awful. The fight scenes looked lazy and the acting was bad. How can Bond, looking for revenge for his wife's murder be so civil with Blofeld following OHMSS? The film started like a revenge mission but then things got friendly.The henchmen Mr Kidd & Mr Wint are by far the worse villains ever on a Bond film and again, the acting is appalling.The plot isn't even interesting. How many more times can Blofeld hold the world ransom? This time, he's doing it with the aid of a diamond-encrusted laser satellite. Considering this is the last time we see Blofeld, there was no explanation or closure to this character. We even get to see the super-villain and mysterious SPECTRE leader in drag. (Shocking) The whole film skimps on action.There are a few saving graces to this film. The locations of Amsterdam and Las Vegas gets the thumb up. The performance of Jimmy Dean as reclusive billionaire Willard Whyte was surprisingly a good casting job. (The only one) The pre-credit scene was good and should have continued in this vein. I score this movie 3 out of 10. It's the worse Bond film by far. Connery should have never come back. Maybe on my next re-watch, I'll skip straight to the Roger Moore legacy.

Here, Michael Bay steps into the war genre with this intense, dramatic retelling of the fateful event that pulled America into World War II in the 1941. Set near the dawn of World War II, Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett play Rafe McCawley and Danny Walker, two Airforce soldiers who have been best friends since childhood. As they grow up, they are caught in a love triangle when they both fall in love with beautiful nurse named Evelyn (played by Kate Beckinsale). Things get pretty complicated when Danny and Evelyn are transferred to Pearl Harbor where Rafe returns from fighting overseas in Great Britain to find the two are in a relationship. Next morning, December 7, Danny and Rafe wake up to find hundreds of Japanese fighter pilots dropping bombs on Pearl Harbor. The two friends arm themselves with the F-51s in attempt to fight off against the Japanese fleet. With the U.S naval base devastated and thousands of innocent lives lost, the U.S declares war against war. From there on, Dafe and Rafe and their army lead by Lieutenant Colonol James Dolittle (played by Alec Baldwin) prepare for a fight against Japan to overcome their country's catastrophic defeat. This film also features Cuba Gooding Jr. who plays Captain Dorie Miller, the first African- American in history to be awarded the U.S Navy Cross.The bombing of Pearl Harbor was one of the most shocking moments in the history of America, and it makes interesting subject matter to be told on on screen. Although this movie does manage to paint the horrors that took place during that fateful day, this film does suffer from some flaws that director Michael Bay is often known. Now with a war movie being directed by Bay, audience should go into this movie expecting abundance of explosions and this film plenty of these during the 40-minute action sequences that takes place during the attack on Pearl Harbor. The entire scene is very well done and the special effects are great. The scene really captures the grim details of what the civilians of Pearl Harbor suffered through as we watch countless of people killed from gunfire and drowning, as well as others who suffer some gruesome injuries. This entire scene is quite difficult to watch and it really pulls at your heart strings. Now here is where the film falters. Along with the whole Japanese attack and its aftermath, audiences are treated with a romantic subplot involving Josh Hartnett, Ben Affleck, and Kate Beckinsale that takes up a good portion of the film. What we get from this is poor acting and cheesy dialogue between Affleck and Beckinsale, including a line I love you so much it hurts, a line that is highly laughable and far too corny, especially when dealing with a war flick. The whole love story is not terrible, but definitely takes more than what is needed of the film. With the whole story, the film ends up running 183 minutes. Pearl Harbor is certainly not one of the best war movies in Hollywood and definitely not the best of what Michael Bay has to offer. I feel that this could have done better if it was handled someone like Steven Spielberg who has been masterful with the World War II genre (Saving Private Ryan, Schindler's List). Overall, this is film is not terrible. Despite some of its flaws, it still works and is entertaining to watch.

I realized that the quotable dialogue comes so often, I could perhaps contain a notepad full of lines to memorize and use when someone around me gets me angry. The dialogue indeed from the lips of the lead characters&#x97;trash columnist Burt Lancaster and his underling press agent, Tony Curtis, (who gets the dirt however he can find it, no matter who gets hurt) willing to do whatever he can to hopefully secure his own column in a major paper someday&#x97;when aimed does have a piercing sharpness which has a purpose to certainly hurt and maim.

JJ even has a photo of her right on his penthouse desk, which tells you exactly what she means to him&#x85;it is creepy. JJ has this military haircut and mathematician glasses, talks with purpose, rarely mincing words at any time, always working an angle that typically includes damaging the rep of somebody so he can continue to thrive financially (including his visits to the finest restaurants and clubs, maintaining a sophisticated, affluent lifestyle), and continue to use frenetic, always-moving, dastardly devious yes-men (in this case, Curtis' Sidney Falco) in order to remain at the top of the hierarchy in the world of gossip and intrigue so addictive and compelling to an audience with the taste for the salacious. Curtis amazes me in the film as this snake in the grass who wakes up, moves through the day, and scurries around the city, in whatever joint that might have the goods to benefit his ambitious goal to get ahead, while Lancaster is all cold-blooded, ice-water-in-his-veins, steely-eyed, egomaniac, who wants things his way and that's it. Martin Milner (Route 66 & Adam 12), as Susan's jazz musician beau that JJ despises for potentially taking his sister away, has a crowd-pleasing moment where he tells the columnist exactly who he is really is and what he truly represents. Emile Meyer, as a bad cop JJ uses when needed, David White, as competitor of JJ's who Sidney lures to a bimbo (Barbara Nichols) he keeps in his good graces for seducing men he needs to use for purposes to further his career (and keep JJ happy), and Sam Levine as Milner's long-suffering agent (trying to keep his client employed despite the impending crises arising due to Milner's involvement with JJ's sis) round out a solid cast. Every character has a monologue or conversation containing dialogue rich with ironic, poetic, mean-spirited, blunt, pointed, or manipulative design, Sweet Smell of Success has an acidic quality that stays with you, I think. Its reputation is justified in how the film is shot, scored, acted, and orchestrated, with the development of characters (most involved in something sleazy and\/or self-important) and plot (many out for themselves, using tactics that ultimately backfire) resulting in the two romantics still coming together despite all the efforts to keep them apart.

In my opinion the film is successful, because the act was very well done.I think the character that did the best was Lenie, because acting stupid is not an easy thing. The best part of the movie is when Lennie crushes Curley's hand because at first Lennie had to act frightened, what he did well, and then he had to act furious, in which he did again good job. The film starts and ends different from the novel. One particularly successful aspect of the film is that there weren't almost any special effects. The camera was always positioned on the right angle.I think the worst part from the movie was when Curley's wife came at the field where the boys were working and began asking questions about her husbands' hand (Curley). I think the portrayal of Curley's wife was incorrect because in the movie she is not as bad described as in the book. They could have made her look worse like in the book.My overall opinion is that the film is quite good, although there were some parts that were not good.

Even though The Mummy follows a typical plot like many other action adventure movies, it has something different that appeals to audiences. Based on Egyptian myth, this movie portrays walking mummies, unstoppable Egyptian curses, and mysterious Egypt's historical sites with wonderful computer graphics and sophisticated special effects. The movie begins in ancient Egypt. When high priest called Imhotep (Amold Vosloo) killed pharaoh Seti the first because of his relationship with the pharaoh's mistress. When the pharaoh's bodyguard caught Imhotep, they mummified him alive with a desperate curse and buried him under the city of the dead. 3000 years later in 1923, Evelyn (Rachel Weisz), who works at Cairo library as a librarian, is interested in an ancient Egyptian magical book of resurrection. To find the book, she hires Rick (Brenden Fraser), who is an American soldier, and they take a trip together through the Sahara desert. At the end of the trip, they finally find and read the book. They don't know what will happen after reading the book. They just release Imhotep from the cruel curse. In the movie, almost every action scene, such as gunfights and chase scenes, are filmed using computer graphics and special effects. It is because Imhotep is a perfect source of computer graphic and special effects since he is an undead mummy and has supernatural abilities. It's truly amazing that Imhotep completes his body as he eats men alive and makes gigantic sand storm in the middle of the desert. Moreover, the mysterious Egyptian historical site, where the action scenes are filmed, makes The Mummy even more thrilling. There are many kinds of deadly traps in the set, such as falling ceiling, pressurized acid, and man eating beetles, so audience can enjoy the thrill of near misses. The director of The Mummy effectively combined Egyptian myth with computer graphics and special effects. That's why he can successfully create the strongest mummy in the movie and he was able to make this movie special compared to other movies. This movie will please anyone who is sick of watching ordinary action movies.
