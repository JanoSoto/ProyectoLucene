Now the story to this isn't all that bad for a straight forward action movie. But the execution of it all just comes off plain ridiculous and over the top in a very unbelievable fashion. It seemed like the makers got together and mashed up things that would be cool to see Jet Li handle. Thus some of the action parts just comes off a bit random with some of the most incompetent bad guys. The story is simple a agent played by Jet Li gets framed by a inspector that is part of the police to feel more of his greedy wants. So Jet Li's character teams up with a prostitute played by Bridget Fonda to take down the bad guys with some martial arts and acupuncture skills. Like I said the story might be simple but it isn't awful and gets the job done. Just wish the direction and execution wouldn't have been so absurd. The corrupt inspector and his goons go around shooting up Paris without anything going wrong for them. The dialogue on the other hand is pretty bad to the point some audiences can't help but chuckle a bit at although it isn't trying to be funny. This is also the first movie I seen Cyril Raffaelli in and he does some cool acrobatic fighting in this against Jet Li.

Real close. Boxing Helena was so close of being good, so close of being an fine and greatly elaborated movie which flies high imagination and weirdness, with pivotal elements of a twisted cult movie. Directed by Jennifer Chambers Lynch, daughter of the great David Lynch, Boxing... can be very enjoyable, an guilty pleasure to some or even an masterpiece to a few. To me, it was quite good until I realize it was going nowhere, completely problematic and when her speech started to fade away into a nebulous emptiness the movie was out of salvation.With a plot resembling one of Douglas Sirk melodramas but mixed with the guts of a weirdo movie, perpassing the idea of an The Collector (Fowles book, Wyler's film), Boxing Helena tells the story of a doctor (Julian Sands) so obsessed with the beautiful Helena (Sherilyn Fenn) of whom he had one night stand (but we never see that), that after an accident she suffered decides to take care of her in his house. She hates him, humiliates him but she can't go anywhere because he amputated her limbs, remaining under his care, devotion, love and obsession for 24\/7. From this point on the movie evolves into a strange therapy where the doctor becomes the patient sharing (or forced to do so) his sexual insecurities with women, being analyzed by Helena the woman of his dreams and thoughts. Such transition is unexplainable, confusing, lacking in tension but filled of eroticism. The whole thing resembles an erotic film of the worst category. One can even claim to have seen soft core flicks better than this, with solid acting and far more exciting.The worst kind of criticism one can make about this film is saying that Jennifer Lynch failed to be like her father or that her work isn't so gripping like the ones the creator of Blue Velvet makes. Inspiration or similar sequences can be found in her work though (the opening scene for instance). She tried to find a way of her own (which is good) by created something more perverse, more melodramatic and more erotic in sensual scenes that lose their appeal very easily. Makes good use of the soundtrack (the scene where the doctor spies Helena, with Tears for Fears playing in the background) and that's the biggest achievement she controls here.What prevents Boxing Helena of being a good movie isn't its painful story or it's lack of imagination in having better moments. More upsetting than anything else is the bad performances from the main cast, something bad but so bad that you have to see it with your own eyes. Sands and Fenn are sexy and good to look at but boy, they do suck terribly here. Poor delivery of lines, unconvincing acting and the film editing that only made look ridiculous (the scene where he's running after seeing her with another man tops it all, is so pathetic that you wanna cover your eyes) and we feel embarrassed for them. And more embarrassing than that is seeing notable names like Bill Paxton, Kurtwood Smith and Art Garfunkel giving some good performances that go to waste in this little project. It's OK for a movie to be weird, twisted and disturbing as long as they have something plausible to say, something to see life with another perspective. Take a look at Cronenberg's Crash, another movie about strange obsessions, fully loaded with eroticism and weird aspects to make one walk out in shock. It was a great film because it has something to show, say and it was well-acted above all. Boxing... only ruined itself with cheap acting, the fluency of an rotten erotic flick and with a frightening ending. One can and should aspire for more than just watching films with some hot scenes but lacking in complexity or depth of character and situations. 4\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"17 August 2012","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Close.

Like with most of his other movies, Coppola seems to have had nothing in particular on his mind&#x97;and in this respect, a comparison between the New Hollywood directors&#x97;De Palma, Lucas, Spielberg, Scorsese, Coppola, perhaps even Cimino, Millius and Stone might be thrown in here --some of these I have badmouthed and cursed here countless times, writing about their outings in a dismissive and contemptuous way, even with certain nastiness, as if Kusturica cursing 'Die Hard', which you must have found out that he did&#x97;I like all of them, nonetheless, and gladly watch their flicks&#x97;a comparison between the main New Hollywood directors, dependable craftsmen, would prove enlightening; anyway, resuming, Coppola often seems to be on to nothing in particular, and this surely is the case with his take on the vampires. 'Dracula' is more of a palette, a study of approaches, devices, etc.. I have seen it many times, and enjoyed it&#x97;twice in a movie theater (the first times I was quite disappointed, I now seem to remember), countless times on a video cassette. Very glamorous, very playful&#x97;avoid those campy, corny, cheesy&#x97;much of it works; at the opposite end, a movie that also works this way is PSYCHO, austere, restrained, stark, unglamorous&#x97;it can be watched countless times&#x97;even on a daily basis&#x97;for the sheer joy, and one that doesn't work and even cloys is ANGEL HEART .... I thought Hopkins was very good in this. I hate Oldman's sunglasses&#x97;but Oldman clad in iron, with his medieval armor, that lavish Transylvanian teaser, with the return from the war . There is also a feel of Victorian corruption and spleen, insidious spleen, given in the over&#x97;the&#x97;top language of the big&#x97;budgeted kitsch ....Do you at least remember, chaps, that ghoulish orgy, that made Reeves, then still in his youthful days, as it seems, a person so envied and despised, that dreadful fancy of submission and of highly corrosive so&#x97;called pleasure? One would suppose it nonetheless takes a very deviant fellow to enjoy that creepy orgy&#x97;to say the least&#x97;yet it even got a Friesian admirer&#x97;yes, a Friesian philosopher quotes it&#x97;as he quotes yet another image from the very same Coppola roller-coaster . More about him, below. One might suppose&#x97;one would be entitled to presume&#x97;that such sicknesses pass unnoticed but by the very perverted .... Yeah, it looks as if for less than sane souls, for less than healthy minds, such rotten fantasies might prove of some interest .... A convinced admirer of Coppola's goth exercise is the Friesian philosopher Kelley Ross, who quotes at least two images from the movie&#x97;the three broads taking over their victim&#x97;and Dracula morphing into rats, dissolving, dismembering into rats, turning into a running hoard of rodents. I have found these two quotes in Ross' pages, after all he's a consumer of popular culture&#x97;Cameron, W. Allen, Lucas, etc.; the more important fact to be underlined here about Ross' fair use of the popular culture tropes is that he doesn't distort them, or twist them to mean arbitrarily assigned things. In his pages, these places in the popular culture mean what they originally meant, he keeps their intended meanings, and finds interest and joy in these their original meanings; you should read K. Ross, in case you didn't already.The unrecognizable Oldman under thick layers of makeup is a cartoon, but young Ţepeş's love is genuinely touching&#x97;that awesome line about the oceans of time&#x97;traveling oceans of time to find his lost wife&#x97;that's chilling, and mind&#x97;blowing . Drãculea whispers in a sonorous low tone that he had traveled oceans of time to find her, who had been lost . Other than that, Ţepeş&#x97;the Voivod of Muntenia, I mean, the historical character, the wild, perhaps demented cub of the Drãculeşti&#x97;has never been a favorite of mine, though we share the first name; I was 14 when I have seen, in that blessed summer of '92, my 1st Dracula movie, one starring Lee&#x97;but none surpasses or even matches that breathtaking, ravishing, heartrending and engrossing masterpiece, the NOSFERATU. Watch that one&#x97;in case you didn't up to now.These are the best two intros in the whole genre cinema, starring two of the most dashing leads&#x97;Oldman, leonine in his armor, at the beginning of Coppola's 'Dracula', and Crowe, before the battle, at the beginning of 'The Gladiator'. Do you know other intros as dashing?

In fact, he hates it so much that he uproots his family from their nice little home in the middle of anywhere is America to a jungle where he proceeds to build his own idealized utopia, complete with a giant ice maker he calls Fat Boy. For a brief time the restless Fox is happy and content, but his utopia is doomed to fail, leading to death, destruction, despair, and ruin. At the time it was released in 1986 director Peter Weir's The Mosquito Coast (based on the novel of the same name) got an at best mixed critical response and was a box office failure. Some believed it was because the film just wasn't box office material for the average American audience. Most however believed that the film failed due to the presence of Harrison Ford as Allie Fox - a role that, not surprisingly, had been offered to Jack Nicholson before Ford signed on. In the big scheme of the Hollywood game Ford built his career on playing sarcastic yet affable action heroes in big adventure films and thrillers, and by that point he had cemented his place as a pop culture icon with not one but two such roles - lovable rogue Han Solo from Star Wars and rugged archaeologist Indiana Jones. Ford had had some trouble gaining recognition for dramatic roles and had only just recently won praise for his role as a cop on the run in 1985's Witness also directed by Peter Weir (as of this writing Witness is still the only film where Ford was nominated for a Best Actor Oscar), and was looking for something different when The Mosquito Coast came his way. Its' easy to see what drew Ford to the part - Allie Fox was about as far removed from his two most iconic roles - and regular parts - as any part could be, and he was such an unusual, offbeat character, the kind that come along once in a lifetime, that it was simply too good to pass up (Ford has even confessed that he agreed with at least some of the character's criticisms about Americans not working hard enough and selling out their values). And therein lay the danger - after years of watching Ford save the day, either from Nazis or an evil intergalactic Empire, audiences just weren't ready to see him playing such an unsympathetic character. Which is too bad since this is quite possibly Ford's most dynamic performance, and certainly deserving of an Oscar nomination (Lord knows that lesser actors have won Oscars for lesser performances in lesser films). Ford embraces the unapologetic, self-destructive nature of the always critical Allie Fox with an unabashed go for broke energy that keeps the film charged from start to finish, and he is surrounded by an excellent cast, including the late River Phoenix as his oldest son (Phoenix later played the young version of Ford in 1989's Indiana Jones & The Last Crusade). Despite the terrible things Fox does in the name of his dream, even after that dream has obviously failed, Ford finds a way to make you feel sorry for him. The Mosquito Coast is a fascinating examination of how far a man will go to achieve his goal, as strange as that goal is, and a clash of ideologies (as seen in Fox clashing with the Reverend) and the ever fragile nature of family. It is not an easy film to watch, not the kind of film you'd want to watch after a long hard day at work, but it is a beautifully shot, fascinating film, and a unique experience for Harrison Ford fans.

However, there is also an obsessive part of me--the part of me that wants to see all the Best Picture Oscar winners. Apart from this film, there are maybe two others I need to complete this...until next year! And, my daughter assured me that the movie wasn't too gory. So, this film review is best appreciated by others who just aren't into gore, serial killings and cannibalism--though, oddly, a very high percentage of viewers DO like such plots.First, the bad news. I sure as heck thought it was a gory film...a very gory film. You see people with huge chunks of skin ripped off, a guy's face ripped off and lots of blood. I don't know how my daughter would think this isn't gory! Second, the not so bad news. Although I really didn't like the film very much, it was interesting and different. Anthony Hopkins did a nice job playing a psycho murder--though I also felt this performance was anything but subtle--but it was entertaining. So did the film change my mind about the genre or this film in particular? No. But, apparently I am in the minority here.UPDATE I recently began watching the TV show, Hannibal, and although I also think it's way too graphic, I much prefer Mads Mikkelson's version of Dr. Lecter. It's much, much more subtle and creepy--without the over the top theatrics of the movie version of the guy.

While this 1990 film is far from terrible, it is the weakest for me of the three Hamlet films I've seen- I loved Branagh's and especially Olivier's- and possibly Zeffirelli's weakest Shakespeare adaptation also. It does have some undeniably good points, it is very well made with very evocative scenery, beautiful atmospheric lighting, sumptuous costuming and cinematography that is moody yet shimmering. The music is haunting and the sound effects really enhance the mood. The script is condensed, but still is very powerful and moving when needed. Ian Holm is a very effective Polonious, the character is creepier than one would expect but it proved to be an interesting touch. Mel Gibson was better than expected, initially it does scream disaster but actually he is charismatic and delivers his lines with meaning. He is perhaps too old for the role(but understandably as other reviewers have pointed out) and Branagh and Olivier conveyed Hamlet's tragedy more convincingly but coming from a non-fan of Gibson this is not a bad performance at all. The acting honours go to Glenn Close, whose Gertrude is beautifully elegant, expressive and sincere. On the other hand, while it is a long play with much complexity and so forth(therefore a slow unfolding pace is necessary) there are some scenes that do come about as too drawn-out and laborious. Zeffirelli I do like for his sumptuous style and how directs actors(and singers), but he does bring forth ideas that are interesting in hindsight but don't do very well in terms of the motivations of the characters, Orphelia and Claudius in particular really suffer from this, and like his Jane Eyre it does get pedestrian in places. Two performances don't work. Alan Bates did have potential to, he is a great actor and has done creepy and evil very well before in The Shout for example. But, not helped by the fact that the scenes make Claudius the character he is are severely reduced, consequently Bates is never evil enough. The worst offender though is Helena Bonham Carter, she has given very good performances(A Room with a View, Sweeney Tood and Howards End) before and like Bates seemed ideal for the role. The reasons why she wasn't is largely again to do with Zeffirelli, the idea to not have Orphelia poignant and meek and instead have her as the complete opposite, strong-willed and almost headstrong was a big mistake, undermining her lunacy scenes. Whereas they should be moving, this change to the character is partly why Bonham Carter's performance feels wildly overacted. On the whole, didn't really work from my perspective but it is not a bad film. 6\/10 Bethany Cox ","genre":null},{"date":"17 August 2012","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" I saw this film as I love the play and I do like Franco Zeffirelli(especially for his opera films like La Traviata).

All of which, was due in large part to the surprising success of a small semi-autobiographical independent film called 'Dazed and Confused' in 1993 about one night in the lives of high school students after the end of the 76' school year.The sudden popularity in retro 70's Nostalgia entertainment during the 90's wasn't a new pop-culture phenomenon however. But merely a nostalgic repeat of a cultural phenomenon that happened in the 70's when an even bigger 50's nostalgic form of retro entertainment was kicked-off after the huge surprising success of the small semi-autobiographical independent film American Graffiti in 1973, which was written and directed by George Lucas about one night in the lives of high school students after the end of the 62' school year. Sound familiar? Despite its shoe string budget 'American Graffiti' became so popular and beloved by audiences in the 70's that Richard Dreyfuss, who played 'Curt' in the movie, said in an interview that co-star Cindy Williams called him shortly after the wide release of 'American Graffiti' and told him to, Go have dinner at a restaurant and see what happens.. When Richard Dreyfuss took Cindy's advice out of curiosity, to his surprise, he was greeted with a room full of patrons and restaurant employees standing and applauding his arrival. This could be considered the official moment when a whole new form of modern nostalgic entertainment began.Sure, there were nostalgic Westerns before that, but no one watching them was actually alive during the events depicted in the multitude of Western movies and TV Shows of the 50's and early 60's. And a lot of the War movies were made while the actual war in Europe and the Pacific was still being fought, and shortly after the war that eventually extended into South Korea during the early 50's. So the War movies were more of an attempt to romanticize current events, and not so much a nostalgic retrospective of the past.All that kind of changed after 'American Graffiti' was released, and the 50's nostalgic era of pop-culture entertainment was officially on. Happy Days, Laverne and Shirley, Grease were all huge hits during the 70's, while lesser known but equally beloved low budget cult classics like American Hot Wax, The Lords of Flatbush and The Wanderers contributed to the saturation of 50's pop-culture nostalgia as well.Also, Sha Na Na was a very well known 50's retro musical group that must have been popular with someone (don't ask me why?) because they were everywhere in movies, radio and TV.But, of course like every temporary pop-culture sensation from Jazz music of the 20's to Adam Sandler movies at the turn of the century. The 50's nostalgic period of the 70's was coming to a slow but definite end with the declining popularity of TV shows like Happy Days and Laverne and Shirley, and the release of only a hand full of movies like Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Outsiders' and 'Peggy Sue Got Married' in the 80's. And, the super retro group Sha Na Na had already broken up as well, although nobody noticed or cared at the time. Whatever your opinion is about the actual cultural landscape of the mid 50's-early 60's is?

They won't believe that one of their own elite could have suckered them all this time. You don't understand&#x85;when they look at you, they don't see you; they see me (my DNA). When Irene, who becomes romantically involved with Vincent discovers that he is an impersonator and also a 'God child' and not a 'science child', she is upset, angry and confounded as to how Vincent has been able to pull it off despite not having the potential &#x96; the right DNA. Vincent confronts her bias and prejudice and shows her how narrow her thinking has been become because of 'them'. You are the authority of what is not possible, aren't you Irene. They have got you working so hard looking for flaws that after a while that's all that you see. For whatever its worth, I'm here to tell you that it's possible.This is a must watch movie for those who suspect that the scientific establishment has abused its authority in the educational process of this now globalized culture to narrow down reality only into what 'they' think that 'they' have determined as valid knowledge. This is the presently unconscious terror that 'they' have unleashed upon this world, the terror of the most deadly kind of ignorance.

Face\/Off is such an inventive movie when it comes to style, the techniques are just dazzling and all the action scenes are well above classic shoot-em-ups. I especially love that scene where hero and villain are standing back to back, Woo already sorta did that in Hard Target but somehow it's even better here. Face\/Off is not all action scenes though. The plot, though completely nonsensical, is very compelling as well. It relies heavily on John Travolta and Nicholas Cage being able to switch characters without effort, and I'm glad to say neither actor disappoints. The way they pick up each other's traits is just brilliant. Even the family subplot of this movie is good, and family subplots in action movies are NEVER any good. Usually they're tacked on at the last minute in a desperate attempt to give characters depth, but in Face\/Off it's an essential part of the story. Face\/Off may be a dumb action flick to some, but it's a dumb action flick with one hell of a heart.

That is, if you don't mind sitting through a mess of a movie that's over 2hrs long, and you don't care what happens to any of the multitude of characters story lines. Except, maybe Diane Lane's character, because she was just that HOT.But, don't worry Cotton Club fans out there, I will include a few positive aspects in this review about the movie. That doesn't involve murder conspiracy's of drug dealing movie producers. Only because IMDb requires at least a 10 line minimum written review before it can be posted on their website. Which is about, 9 lines longer than I care to spend writing about The Cotton Club. But the rules are the rules.The best thing The Cotton Club has to offer an audience is its stellar ensemble cast of actors and actresses. Even the ones that aren't Diane Lane. Some were already well established TV and Movie stars like Richard Gere, Fred Gwynne, Gwen Verdon and Gregory Hines. While others weren't house hold names yet like Nicholas Cage, Laurance Fishburne, Diane Lane and Bob Hoskins. But, would go on later to become huge Stars despite their appearance in The Cotton Club. I guess someone up there likes them?However, despite the movies great ensemble cast, you just DO NOT care about any of the characters in the movie. It's really hard to say exactly why you don't care if Nicholas Cage's character is gun downed in a phone booth. Or if Gregory Hines, Richard Gere and Laurance Fishburn ever get the girl at the end of the movie. Maybe, it's because there were so many different characters, that you never cared about, who couldn't get the girl until the very end of the movie. The only time I ever cared about any of the characters who didn't get me aroused while watching them, like Diane Lane for example. Is when I felt Sad that the evil Mob boss Dutz Sholtz was eventually killed, because he was the only interesting character in the entire movie. The Cotton Clubs' writer\/director Francis Ford Coppola has made some great movies and some stinkers. The Cotton Club is definitely at the top of Coppola's 'Stinker List'. I hope I finally have the required IMDb 10 line minimum to post a review this time? I really don't want to spend any more time writing about The Cotton Club.

It is fair to say, I like it more than most people do. It is about two friends Stacy (Lea), and Melissa (Victoria Jackson), and their hunt for Mr. Right. Melissa succeeds when she meets Jamie (Jerry Levine), But my primary focus is in Lea and the person who steals the film Andrew Dice Clay as Vinny, so I will leave Melissa and Jamie alone. Until seeing the comments section on IMDb, I did not know there was an alternate ending with Stacy ending up divorced and unhappy, while Vinny remained a pathetic excuse for a human being, that was test marketed and rejected. I think that was the right decision. Not only is there a chemistry between the characters, but it fits the context of the film better. Spoilers ahead What happens is Stacy meets Nick(Stephen Shellen) and he moved in with her. It turned out he was a slacker musician, with an overinflated view of himself I am going to be bigger than Elvis. Eventually she had to throw him out. At the same time she meet Vinny from New Jersey, who was an arrogant individual who thought he was God's gift to women, and she and Melissa put him in his place. Later on, he wrote to Stacy saying The Vin Man needed improvement, so I started dressing better, stopped hanging out and hitting on women. Stacy said I'm impressed, deep down he like the rest of us, messed up. Later on, during the Christmas Holiday's, Vinny goes for a long road trip (He is alone for the Holidays (As is Stacy)), and as he said I did not realize it, but I came to see you.(Stacy). But she basically ignores him (Probably because of the bad experience of Nick), and as he walked away, she called him back, and he asked if she wanted anything to eat, Stacy said Everything is closed, but I will make you something. Vinny said I will make you something. Stacy said I will like that. Vinny said wait I got you something for Christmas which was a puppy. The next scene is years later, at Christmas, when Melissa and Jamie come over, and while Stacy is decorating the tree, Vinny is tied up by their boys, and Jamie will be getting the same treatment. When Stacy sees that she says There goes your boyfriend., and Melissa says the same, the film ends with Stacy saying Yea, there goes my boyfriend. (With a look of contentment and happiness). As the song comes on No More Casual Sex Mon. What I really like is the way that Vinny started out as a real jerk, and made the changes necessary, so he could grow as a character, which would allow him to end up with someone like Stacy (Which from a guy's point of view, is a worthwhile goal), but also how Stacy was able to realize this. Thus, overcoming her doubts about not only Vinny, but herself (There is a scene where she mentions being alone to Melissa, and her body language showed how unhappy she was) and still gave Vinny a chance to prove himself (Character growth is usually a good thing, and that is what we saw with Vinny, and the Happy Ending is what showed that (Which is why that ending fit well within the context of the movie)). What is also interesting is the end where the virginal Melissa, and the shy Jamie were living with each other, and how the bad boy and girl (Vinny and Stacy) became the married couple with kids.

The fact is society already had passed this point in 1967 thanks to trail blazers Sidney Portier, Bill Cosby, and Martin Luther King who is mentioned in the film. The important point here is that the media had not gotten past it. Sadly that is still true today.All I have to do is point out the treatments given to people in the media still.

I'll have to say though the first time I saw it I was not that satisfied with it and I think I even stopped watching it so if you 've only seen the movie once but enjoy comedies watch this movie again and give it another try because it's the type of movie where you catch things second, third time around that you didn't notice before.I love all the catch phrases from the movie especially Mr. Zadir  Dooey did you grab my ass My favorite scene from this movie is the wedding scene at the end which marks the climax of the film. They way everything just came together full circle and then the new club what a perfect way to end a movie.

I really don't think PLATOON is one of the greatest films ever made and I'm not certain I'd even place it among the best films of the decade but you have to admire a war film that doesn't try to be manly or fun. This is one of the most depressing, dark and somber films you're ever going to see about the war and I think this is its strongest aspect. It's even more raw when you know that Stone went through this stuff and is basically sharing his memories of what it was like serving in Vietnam. I wasn't even born yet so I'm not going to sit here and say which film most realistically captured the war but when I hear people say this is the closest it's easy to see why. Stone's direction is certainly the star here because he really makes the viewer feel like they were in a platoon and there's no question that the director gets his points across without preaching. The film is ultra intense during certain scenes and brutally sad in others and especially during a scene where villagers are attacked and we're not even sure if they're guilty or not. The entire thing does make you wonder why such violence was needed and if it accomplishes anything. Of course, looking back on the film today you are amazed at how many great performers are here. Tom Berenger, Willem Dafoe and Sheen are all excellent in their leading bits but we get terrific support from the likes of Forest Whitaker, Keith David, Francesco Quinn, John C. McGinley, Kevin Dillon, Tony Todd and Johnny Depp. PLATOON isn't a fun film to watch but then again should a film like this be fun to watch?
