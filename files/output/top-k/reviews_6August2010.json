Actually, it is more significant now than when it was made and, I dare to say, ever - which disguises its age. True, even in the good old days there were problems, but the world was better at the time. The world has changed a lot and everything that surrounds it, even more so since we entered in the 2000 generation. And progress just keeps changing the world and everything fast, way too fast. The world has gone crazy.Michael Douglas is the main protagonist. While he does a great portrayal of the character William Foster, better than his performance is the character himself. It's an unusual role by Michael Douglas and that's what makes the movie interesting. The role he portrays is the reflex of this generation. People are always in rush, under pressure and stress nowadays. Exactly like Douglas's character. The big difference is that Douglas's character found a way to throw up all his fury by doing things that most of us wouldn't have the guts to, no matter how much urge we felt to. You've gotta admire this guy for that.William Foster does very wrong things, but I understand just how he feels and what he is going through. The demands and fierceness of society, the pressures, the frustrations, the stress, the nerves... all of that can lead to insanity. Don't we all just want to explode at times, just like Douglas's character? I'm sure that we all feel like this in certain times of our lives.Deep down, Foster ain't a bad guy. He is just an ordinary guy who has become so stressed and frustrated that he has come to a point which he can't hide his anger anymore. That is obvious on his variable temper. He is enraged, disturbed, confused and makes sardonic observations on life and other stuff.Basically the story is about him, a normal man declaring war against his daily frustrations across the city of Los Angeles and at the same time trying to get home for his daughter's birthday party. And it all happens in only one day! A very hot Summer day, to be precise.Not everything is good, though. I hate the Nazi guy and the whole sequence with him. As for the ending, although well made, it's a shame that Foster gets killed. I feel sorry for the guy.The best parts of the film are the crazy korean convenience store sequence; the hilarious sequence at the fast food restaurant; the bazooka sequence - that's hysterical! (he doesn't even know how to use it, but a kid teaches him); the golf course bit.

And surreal art may disturb, irritate or make people commit suicide! This film may be difficult to watch for normal popcorn cinema movie watchers, but for people who are ready to really think and discuss about a movie even after they've quit the cinema or turned off their television and who are ready to watch this film again and again, it will be a pure pleasure to watch this movie. I know many people who find this movie too long, too complicated, too boring and if you're waiting for some action, a lot of suspense and an explosive beginning, you should not even watch it. This is not just a movie, it's an art! And this movie works like a painting that you watch again and again in a museum and where you would like to analyse what the painter wants to express with its creation. It takes its time, but it's worth the wait and surely precious.The movie begins in a slow paced way and works a lot with its dark, weird and haunting atmosphere. Weird music, the filming of dark floors without an end or empty rooms, the lack of dialogs in the beginning may irritate the viewer but every detail has a certain role and a certain reason to be shown in this movie. Everything seems so slow and when the film really starts, you're all of a sudden in it and it all comes too quick, too strange and you might not be able to concentrate on the essential things.Anyway, what is the essential thing about this movie? What does David Lynch want to show us or make us learn? Or is the sense of it all that there is absolutely nothing to learn? The movie plays with our feelings, our thoughts, our expectations and always presents something unexpected. And everyone may interpret the unexpected in a different way or maybe not at all.Now wait, this may be the key to this movie Expect the unexpected! And watch this movie several times! Who is who and why and when does a person appear and disappear? Which person is the opposite of another person in this movie? Who is friend or foe with whom and why? Or why does it change throughout the movie? There are a lot of things that you could analyse and compare and even after having watched this movie at least five times, I still find new elements, new keys to a possible hidden treasure in this movie and I am now able to build up my own theory of the movie. But I won't tell you and I would give you the advice to not look for possible answers on wikipedia or movie websites because this movie is personal for everyone and before you may look for other opinions, you shall at least have watched the movie a couple of times. You must watch it in tranquility. When you watch this movie and the phone is ringing - you're out of it even if you don't think so! If you watch the movie and your girlfriend is bored and wants you to do other things with you - you're out of it! If you watch this on television and there is a commercial break - you're out of it! Just sit down and watch, take a break from everything for two hours and a half.And let it all come to you. The dark and strange atmosphere. The strange music, containing dark classical arrangements, heavy modern jazz music, pop music and even industrial metal - the music always fits to the certain situation. The three mysterious video cassetts and their strange and terrible content. The mysterious break and change of the main character in the movie. The allusions and antithesis between the first and the second part of the movie. The thin path between reality and illusion, the question of dreaming or being awake. The femme fatale and the mystery man. The murderer who doesn't want to be a murderer. The connection between the beginning and the end of the movie. There is more than a lot to discover! This movie is somehow a psycho or mystery thriller with some action and pornographic elements. There are even three movies in one a dark and atmospheric thriller, a strange romantic road movie story and a little short movie which connects the other two elements throughout the film. This movie is certainly different from everything you have ever seen before.It is sure that this movie is not the one which may have received ten Oscars, the best critics or the most attention. This movie is over the top, beyond a normal movie, beyond any critics, beyond any prices like Oscars. This is an uneasy watch and feels real and even surreal.Are you open-minded, concentrated, introspective, philosophic and intellectual enough to give this movie a try? Try it, prove it to yourself! And be sure to live an experience that you may like or dislike but which is different from any other one. Personally, this one is at least in the top 5 of my all time favourite movies! If you like it, don't try to look somewhere else for something similar. Discover the works of David Lynch and watch Mulholland Drive. Or maybe a simple movie isn't enough? Try all the episodes of the Twin Peaks series! You try to be arrogant and you would say that you like the movie but you think that is not surreal enough and even too simple? Than, go for Eraserhead!

What ensues is a game of cat and mouse between Harry and Alan(Glover), Leo(Trebor), and Bobby(Williams III) ending as these thrillers often due, in bloodshed. John Frankenheimer directs a story by Elmore Leonard where we must spend time with some pretty unsavory people and, while we might not condone Harry's own actions, can forgive him of his transgressions because Alan, in particular, is so completely vile and repulsive, that his affair seems minuscule in comparison. Bobby(as presented by the scary-looking Clarence Williams III)is more or less unstable, hardly hanging by a thread(watch as he smothers Vanity with a doll, trying to see if she told Harry anything about their identities), and is a foil for the more cunning and devious Alan who knows how to play his co-horts like a fiddle. What I felt works best for 52 PICK-UP is the difficult scenario Harry finds himself in. How in the world will Harry dig himself out of such a deep hole? It's mind games, really.

Kidnapping Barbara(Margret)gives him an advantage(there's one horrible scene where we see Alan drug Barbara so he can molest her), but Harry, of course, will get the last laugh. While Ann-Margret's role isn't as noteworthy, the cast, especially Glover and Williams III, is excellent. I imagine, though, that having to tolerate so much screen time with the evil trio(and their lifestyle around the world of the sex industry) may be a bit demanding for some viewers.

When he doesn't pay up, instead informing his politician wife(Ann-Margret) of his misdeeds, the pornographers murder Harry's mistress(Kelly Preston), using his own gun and planting his coat(both stolen from 's house)in her blood as evidence against him. What ensues is a game of cat and mouse between Harry and Alan(Glover), Leo(Trebor), and Bobby(Williams III) ending as these thrillers often due, in bloodshed. John Frankenheimer directs a story by Elmore Leonard where we must spend time with some pretty unsavory people and, while we might not condone Harry's own actions, can forgive him of his transgressions because Alan, in particular, is so completely vile and repulsive, that his affair seems minuscule in comparison. Bobby(as presented by the scary-looking Clarence Williams III)is more or less unstable, hardly hanging by a thread(watch as he smothers Vanity with a doll, trying to see if she told Harry anything about their identities), and is a foil for the more cunning and devious Alan who knows how to play his co-horts like a fiddle. What I felt works best for 52 PICK-UP is the difficult scenario Harry finds himself in. How in the world will Harry dig himself out of such a deep hole? It's mind games, really.

The plan fails, however, resulting in a subsequent battle of wits in which Milland, Kelly and a police detective (actor John Williams as Chief Inspector Hubbard) attempt to outsmart one another.Based on a stage play by Frederick Knott, Dial M For Murder is, unsurprisingly, all sparse indoor locations and back-and-forth banter. Still, Hitchcock's clinical direction elevates things tremendously. Every line of dialogue oozes macabre delight, characters trade barbs and ripostes like cannon volleys, and the Master's plot unfolds like a well oiled piece of machinery, Hitchcock's camera, dialogue and cadence cold, immaculate and precise.Best of all, though, is the way Hitchcock juxtaposes up-market sophistication and respectability with devilish secrets and dastardly deeds. Despite their social standing, everything in this film is devious to the core.Of course there have been many films about the perfect murder, and countless TV shows\/films which rely on Dial M For Murder's Agatha Cristie inspired drawing room mystery plot (Hitchcock's own The Lady Vanishes, Strangers On a Train, Rope etc all rehash this formula somewhat).

The name may sound unfamiliar to the majority of you; he worked as a director and producer on 1994's Cemetery Man and served as an actor for films such as in Paura nella città dei morti viventi (Gates of Hell from 1980) and Lo squartatore di New York (The New York Ripper from 1982) &#x96; both of which were directed by the master of horror Lucio Fulci. Soavi also had the privilege of working with Dario Argento; in 1982 he served as an assistant director in the infamous giallo Tenebre. Three years later he would appear not only as an actor but also a Second Unit Director once more in Phenomena and Dèmoni. StageFright Aquarius is the result of a man who has worked closely with the forerunners of Italian horror.The story opens with a dramatic theatre scene that's cut short by the play's director, Brandon. After he thoroughly berates the production's leading lady, Alicia, she secretly leaves the building to have a doctor treat her sprained ankle. Alicia, paired with her with fellow theatre companion Betty, have no choice but to seek help from the local mental hospital in order to receive treatment. There, they happen-across a dark room that houses a mentally disturbed patient.

It's better than most low-budget Slashers but when you look at the competition, it doesn't say much. The acting and soundtrack especially are above average. The gore-factor is well executed too, and for 1987, quite plausible. If you're able to handle a theme that plays out rather commonly, it's worth a look.

With an interesting cast, that includes new Hollywood faces like Noah Whyle, Drew Barrymore, the Gyllenhaal brothers, Jena Malone and Seth Rogen with more experienced artists such as Mary McDonell, Katherine Ross, Patrick Swayze, Beth Grant and Holmes Osborne, the movie was produced with a low budget and shot in a very short period of time.Now, we have Donnie Darko The director's cut, a DVD that includes 15 more minutes than the original film, which represents the real work Kelly and his crew did. Set in 1988, the movie narrates the story of Donnie Darko, a troubled teenager that suffers from schizophrenia. One of his hallucinations, in the form of a giant rabbit called Frank, tells him that the world will come to an end in exactly 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes and 12 seconds.This singular event is accompanied with the fact that a plane motor falls in Donnie's bed at midnight (he's saved because Frank's appearance). Since then, the facts of the history and the situations the characters are in, seem to drag them to that imminent end. Kelly shows Donnie's world, with his parents (Holmes Osborne and Mary McDonell), his sisters, his psychiatrist (Katherine Ross), his teachers and girlfriend (Jena Malone).Donnie Darko tells a complex but well worked story. Understood in first moment as a psycho-thriller, the film combines effectively elements of comedy (with acid sarcasm), drama and science fiction. The 80's background is also greatly accurate, in its political and social context, where we can see Donnie as a teenager looking for the truth, affected by two visions of the world one of the annoying teacher Kitty Farmer (Grant) and the hypocrite Jim Cunningham (Swayze), that represent the most conservative side of the American way of life; and the other, represented by teachers Monitoff y Pomeroy (good performances of Whyle y Barrymore), young and in-conformist characters at the school.With outstanding and realistic special effects, a precise direction and an open final, Donnie Darko is a great surprise and an interesting and unclassified movie; a sort of gem in the American film industry a total win for its director, who was awarded with more than 10 prizes for the film, mostly in independent film Festivals.

Kevin Costner who plays Ray Kinsella hears a voice while standing in his corn field. Ray hears someone telling him If you build it, he will come. Ray was standing in the field alone and looked at this voice as being his leader in finding his purpose. Ray takes this voice as direction that he needs to build a baseball field in his corn field. When Ray goes to tell his wife Annie (Amy Madigan) what he heard, she seems confused but tells him to follow his dreams. The theme here is to follow your dreams. Ray was searching for his purpose in life and really was not excited about too much. When he was standing in the corn field and heard the random voice, he knew that he must do what they said. Ray took the voice as telling him he needs to build a baseball field. He would do just that. Rays father, who recently passed away, had a passion for baseball. With Rays father John Kinsella (Dwier Brown) gone, he thought that his love for the Chicago White Sox was one of the reasons why he was hearing the voice. Ray started knocking down the corn stocks to build the field. He worked very hard on this; many locals would drive by in disbelief and uncertainty on what he was doing with the field. People often would laugh at him for his passionate actions. Ray gets very discouraged quickly and finds himself looking for another option. With everyone thinking he is crazy, his brother in law tells him he must give up and put the baseball field back to a regular corn field. With Ray being very discouraged, he happens to see several baseball players from the 1919 World Series team playing on the field. Ray then hears the strange voice again. This forces him to contact Terrance (James Earl Jones), who wrote a book about baseball. Ray then goes to Minnesota to meet up with him. The two men talk about baseball and the voices he heard. They both then return to Iowa. On the way back to the field, they pick up a hitchhiker who is a young man who says his name is Archie Graham (Frank Whaley) that wants to be a professional baseball player. They all three go to the field, and the young man goes to play baseball, when Ray realizes that other plays are playing on the field while he was gone. Ray then begins to argue with his brother in law about returning the field to a corn field. Rays Daughter Karin falls and is not breathing. When everyone goes to help, Young Moonlight rushes over to help Karin. He gets her to cough up the piece of hot dog. Ray then realizes that Moonlight cannot go back to his baseball days and shows a lot of apologies. Moonlight then goes back on the field and starts walking to the corn in the outfield with the other plays. Terrance then gets asked to go with them, which makes Ray very angry. They explain to him that he must stay behind to take care of his family. The lighting and angle of the camera bring a dramatic feel to this scene. Ray then hears the voice again, when his attentions is drawn to the catcher. When the catcher takes his mask off, he realizes that it's his father. Annie then insists on Ray introducing John to his granddaughter Karin. John then turns around to go to the outfield with the rest of the plays. Ray then asks John to play catch with him.

You could say that the male and female characters switched roles in this and it's about someone wanting to marry someone down her class rather that up her class. It are things like this that make All That Heaven Allows an original movie to watch, despite the fact that nothing in it really happens as a big surprise.Saying that its not very surprises doesn't mean that the movie is an ineffective one. It's a movie that does work out very well, due to its different approach and story but also due to its sincerity. It doesn't all feel too melodramatic and the characters are all ones that are not without their human flaws. It makes some of them likable, or at least recognizable. It's just easier to identify yourself with these people than with a couple of teens that are in the prime of their lives and look perfect in basically every way. In this movie the couple is not such a likely one actually, since the woman is not only older she also is a upper class member, while the man is a simple gardener. Yet the love between them feels sincere and you actually never think about their age different or the difference in class but the people around them do. This is were the movie its 'conflict' enters. The woman must choose between her safe and secure life as a respected woman, with friends in the right circles and a loving family around her or the love of a man that has not much to offer and will make her friends and family look down at her once she will marry him. This in a nutshell is its story and it's a story that simply does work out well within the movie.It definitely helps the movie and its story that the characters are not perfect ones and they are also not perfect looking ones, though Rock Hudson was still an heartthrob at the time, years before the world knew that he was actually an homosexual. Something that just wasn't accepted at all in Hollywood at the time and he actually was married to a woman at the time, to keep up appearances. Quite sad but apparently also really necessary at the time. Makes you wonder if he would had still gotten this leading type of roles in this kind of movies if he was openly homosexual. Probably not. Luckily a lot has changed over the years, even in Hollywood.The movie is an absolute charming looking one. It's funny how these early color movies are way more colorful looking then movies now days. It really gives the movie some charm and warmth.

Quite sad but apparently also really necessary at the time. Makes you wonder if he would had still gotten this leading type of roles in this kind of movies if he was openly homosexual. Probably not.

The Filth and the Fury tells the story from the viewpoint of the band members themselves and goes some way to dispelling the myths that surround them and their self publicising manager. The title of the film is a reference to a headline that appeared in the British tabloid newspaper The Daily Mirror after an interview with the band on ITV's Today show presented by Bill Grundy. The story follows the band members from their humble beginnings in London's Shepherd's Bush, to their implosion at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco, and then to coup de grace as Sid Vicious & Nancy Spungen left the mortal coil.Love them or hate them, The Sex Pistols in the mid to late 70s created a wave in the music industry that can still be felt today. Most of it now seems tame of course, swearing on TV and alleged distasteful songs are common practice these days, but it were not the case back when flared trousers and guys wearing make up gave way to Punk Rock Britannia. But is there anything here for those who just don't get that the Pistols were influential and one of Britain's most important bands? Yes, definitely. This is no rose tinted glasses documentary serving only to keep the Pistols name on the high heat. Nor, is it over an hour and half of their videos and live footage. Of course the music features prominently, but it's in context to the story, a story that sees the remaining band members give frank and honest assessments of the time, the place and the now.Interviewing the band singularly in darkened silhouette to give off the impression we are witnessing criminal informers at work, Temple also puts the band into historical context with Britain's social situation in the 1970s. This is crucial to the origins of the band. It was a time of strikes and suspect politicians, so with archival footage from the period, Temple fuses the Pistols ire with that of a country that was limping along in apathy. Haters of the band don't want to agree of course, but the Pistols showed that not all of Britain would surrender meekly, and, that music could actually make a difference and shake up the system. Get Off Your Arse snarled John, and thousands did, as Punk bands formed over night and showed that the youth of the day had a voice. How many bands can say that eh?But as we know, it was to be a short lived journey for the band, one that would end in tragedy as first the press went bazooka over the top with their every move, and then as one out of his depth bass player lost sight of the bands vision. This part of the film is subtly handled by Temple, the sense of impending doom hangs heavy, none more so with the old interviews held with Vicious that are woven into the last third as self destruction grows ever near. These sequences show what many people either forget or don't realise; that Vicious was just a kid of 21 years of age. This part of the tale also lets us into an untapped part of Lydon's neRotten emotional side, a telling moment that brings the sorry chapter to a close.From a time when music could be as dangerous as the politicians running the country, The Filth & The Fury is an essential music based movie.

Lewis, written by Philip Yordan and photographed by cinematographer and noir icon John Alton. David Raksin scores the music and it stars Cornel Wilde, Richard Conte, Jean Wallace, Brian Donlevy, Lee Van Cleef & Earl Holliman. The story sees Wilde as Police Lt. Leonard Diamond who is on a personal mission to bring down sadistic gangster Mr. Brown (Conte). Something that's doubly perilous since he's infatuated with Brown's girlfriend, Susan Lowell (Wallace), who is trapped by the hold that Brown has on her.Violent, dark and sexy, The Big Combo is a riveting experience from start to finish. In truth, Yordan's writing is pretty standard stuff here, but Lewis, Raksin and Alton really raise the bar in film noir atmospherics. From the nifty beginning where a blonde lady flees a darkened boxing match-pursued by two heavies-to the foggy airport conclusion, Lewis' movie revels in shifty shadows, shifty sexual motives and even shiftier characters. Upon its release the film caused something of a stir on account of its tricksy thematics, and that's not hard to believe since the film still comes off as potent even today. It's a film where what you don't see has the greater effect, and where suggestion is everything; for better or worse. One sexy scene involving Conte stepping in when Jack Palance bailed and Wallace so incensed Wilde, who was then married to Wallace, he tried to have it taken out the picture! Yes this is a ripper of a movie to be sure.Set entirely at night time, in and amongst dimly lit back alleys, rain-sodden pathways and moody plush apartments, the piece gives Alton the chance to shoot his chiaroscuro magic. I can't state enough just how great his work is here, sexual urges are cloaked in a fatalistic sheen, nocturnal shenanigans briefly lit by the blink of some neon ray. Masterful. Away from the smart technical aspects (the cast are strong, the set pieces brisk too), the piece works great as a gangster movie, this in spite of there only being a small handful of crooks in the story. That the two henchmen superbly underplayed by Cleef & Holliman are evidently gay, just adds more sexual deviance into the sleazy norish stew. Gangsters, cops & society gals, all of them have a sense of doom hanging over them, to which they have the same things in common; that of blending violence with sex. Raw direction, moodily photographed and jazzily scored, The Big Combo is a big movie in the noir pantheon. 9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"6 August 2010","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" The Big Combo is directed by Joseph H.

The catch? She must also work for the agency that gave her this second chance as a top secret assassin. This brief synopsis alone made me expect much more from this movie than I was given. Especially when the likes of Luc Besson (Leon, The Fifth Element) is directing and writing. La Femme Nikita is unfortunately missing the impressive edge I've come to expect from Besson.The film starts out well when we are introduced to our protagonist, Nikita (Anne Parillaud). She is an over exaggerating, rambunctious, loud individual who hates everyone around her and does not have a problem shouting death threats at every single person in the same room as her. She's a fun character to watch and Anne Parillaud does a fantastic job at playing her tormented and insane role. After she is arrested and her death faked, the government agency that takes her in begins to rehabilitate her so that she can be reintegrated into society as a normal person (save the whole government assassin bit). As we watch her character begin to form we are left waiting for the actual goods to be delivered. Yet I felt like they never were to their full potential. I constantly felt I wanted more than what I was being given.For the most part, La Femme Nikita lulls, especially through the middle. It picks up at sporadic points, only to fall back down again. I found myself not quite as engulfed in the story as I thought I would be, and most of the time I was waiting for something to actually happen. I expected a riveting ending and thankfully this was mostly given to me with the entrance of Jean Reno's character. It picked up considerably with some intense action backed by Reno's fantastic portrayal of the calm cool and collected hit-man. There is one final conversation between two characters that ends the film and I did feel satisfied after that. The ending gave the entire movie some redeeming qualities, but didn't completely make up for the lackluster middle.By now I feel like I've given the impression that I just plain didn't like this movie. That's not true. La Femme Nikita isn't a bad movie, it just lacks where you'd expect it to excel. Luc Besson is a great director and writer and you can tell by watching La Femme Nikita for what it's worth. There are some very well shot scenes, some great exchanges between characters, and a story that isn't amazing but it is still there and it's still relevant. All these great elements are just so sporadic that they don't carry through the film as a whole, they only stand out when they are present. La Femme Nikita is still a decent film, it just could have been so much more.

As we watch her character begin to form we are left waiting for the actual goods to be delivered. Yet I felt like they never were to their full potential. I constantly felt I wanted more than what I was being given.For the most part, La Femme Nikita lulls, especially through the middle. It picks up at sporadic points, only to fall back down again. I found myself not quite as engulfed in the story as I thought I would be, and most of the time I was waiting for something to actually happen. I expected a riveting ending and thankfully this was mostly given to me with the entrance of Jean Reno's character. It picked up considerably with some intense action backed by Reno's fantastic portrayal of the calm cool and collected hit-man. There is one final conversation between two characters that ends the film and I did feel satisfied after that. The ending gave the entire movie some redeeming qualities, but didn't completely make up for the lackluster middle.By now I feel like I've given the impression that I just plain didn't like this movie. That's not true. La Femme Nikita isn't a bad movie, it just lacks where you'd expect it to excel. Luc Besson is a great director and writer and you can tell by watching La Femme Nikita for what it's worth. There are some very well shot scenes, some great exchanges between characters, and a story that isn't amazing but it is still there and it's still relevant. All these great elements are just so sporadic that they don't carry through the film as a whole, they only stand out when they are present. La Femme Nikita is still a decent film, it just could have been so much more.

The catch? She must also work for the agency that gave her this second chance as a top secret assassin. This brief synopsis alone made me expect much more from this movie than I was given. Especially when the likes of Luc Besson (Leon, The Fifth Element) is directing and writing. La Femme Nikita is unfortunately missing the impressive edge I've come to expect from Besson.The film starts out well when we are introduced to our protagonist, Nikita (Anne Parillaud). She is an over exaggerating, rambunctious, loud individual who hates everyone around her and does not have a problem shouting death threats at every single person in the same room as her. She's a fun character to watch and Anne Parillaud does a fantastic job at playing her tormented and insane role. After she is arrested and her death faked, the government agency that takes her in begins to rehabilitate her so that she can be reintegrated into society as a normal person (save the whole government assassin bit).
