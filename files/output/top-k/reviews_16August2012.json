Basically, in most crime films, everything goes wrong by the end, and that's no different here, so it treads familiar ground and doesn't really have anything new to say regarding juvenile delinquents, but Clark should be appreciated for his characterizations here. Every line of dialogue feels natural coming from each character's mouth, so the writing is very consistent, and the conversations that occur throughout the film are snappy and amusing for the most part. The critics were right about James Woods stealing the show, but the other three leads held their own well, and I was particularly impressed by the character transformation from Vincent Kartheiser.The Reverend character was pointless though, and his introductory scene is just an unnatural way of getting the guns in the main characters' hands. He could've been cut out altogether, especially since his dialogue wasn't very well written or as funny as the writers may have thought. I liked the music used, especially in the club scene and the ending, and the cinematography was better than I expected. It looked especially good in the finale. There's a single gunfight that takes place in the film, which is directed so well and realistically that I wanted to see more, but this isn't an action movie as much as it is a character study, so it was a smart move to keep the action to a bare minimum. I get a real kick out of crime films with non-linear structures, and this is one of them. There's a plot, but the movie doesn't take a straightforward approach to get through it.This film definitely isn't for everyone though, and I was a bit worried as it went one because it started to become tedious and lose my interest, but it manages to drastically pick up at the end as tragedy rears its ugly head. This isn't a film for anyone who's squeamish when it comes to vivid violence though, as well as people poking needles in their skin, but this is a Larry Clark film, so what else do you expect? He doesn't give a damn about his characters here, he's showing how pathetic and miserable their lifestyles are, and thus, one shouldn't expect to feel any sympathy for them even though the actors bring some added personality to the table. This isn't as bad as his other films in terms of what is shown, so I guess one could call it his most accessible film, and most are likely to think it's his most entertaining effort.

He had, admittedly, made occasional films on other subjects, notably The Last Temptation of Christ, but even so he was not the most likely candidate to direct an adaptation, in best Merchant-Ivory heritage cinema style, of a novel by Edith Wharton. The Age of Innocence was to reveal him as a more versatile director than many had hitherto realised. Heritage cinema is often regarded as something uniquely British, although this is a misconception; there are, for example, a number of fine French examples. A number of Americans have played a part in the development of the genre in Britain; James Ivory is American by birth, as was Joseph Losey who directed one of the earliest examples of the style, The Go-Between. The House of Mirth (also based on a Wharton novel) is a film in this style on an American subject, but made in Britain by a British director, Terence Davis. The Age of Innocence, by contrast, is a piece of genuinely American heritage cinema, although several of the cast are British or Irish. The story is set among the affluent classes of 1870s New York. Newland Archer is a lawyer engaged to be married to the beautiful young socialite May Welland but who finds himself attracted to May's cousin, Countess Ellen Olenska. Ellen is something of a controversial figure in New York's high society. She is separated from her abusive and unfaithful husband, a Polish count. Worse still, rumour has it that she herself has had an adulterous affair with her husband's (male) secretary. Newland first meets Ellen when she consults his firm about a possible divorce, although she eventually decides not to go through with it in order to spare her family further scandal. (Although American law at this period permitted divorce, American high society strongly disapproved of it). As their friendship deepens into love, Newland has to decide whether to follow the desires of his heart or the expectations of society. When I first saw this film in the cinema, back in 1993, I remember thinking that Newland must be mad if he could contemplate leaving the lovely Winona Ryder, with her fragile, haunting beauty, even for someone as undoubtedly attractive as Michelle Pfeiffer. I must say that my wife is still of that opinion, but having seen the film again recently I began to understand his feelings more. Ryder's May, for all her loveliness, is someone who comes across as shallow, conventional and slightly dull. Pfeiffer's Ellen, by contrast, is a woman of greater maturity, experience and worldly wisdom. Her air of exoticism and sophistication might make her suspect in the eyes of society, but it is precisely these characteristics which make her so fascinating to Newland. Newland is not what I have come to think of as a typical Daniel Day-Lewis character. Perhaps there is no such thing as a typical Day-Lewis character, but the roles I most associate him with are those where he has to play individuals who are angry, outspoken or in some respect social outsiders. In some cases these figures are excluded from society by causes beyond their control, such as Christy Brown in My Left Foot, excluded by his disabilities, or Gerry Conlan in In the Name of the Father, excluded by an unjust conviction for a crime he did not commit, or Hawkeye in The Last of the Mohicans, who feels more at home in Indian society than in the white society to which he belongs by birth. In other cases, however, he plays characters who can be considered anti-social personalities, such as Bill the Butcher in Gangs of New York (also made by Scorsese) and Plainview in There Will Be Blood. In this film, however, Day-Lewis shows his versatility by playing a man who is very much a social insider, one who is fascinated by social outsiders like Ellen but who fears becoming an outsider himself. There is, in fact, some very subtle acting from all three of the leads. Pfeiffer also showed her versatility; her two previous roles before this one, Catwoman in Batman and the blue-collar housewife Lurene in Love Field had been about as different from Countess Olenska as one could imagine, although she had earlier played another period-drama heroine in Dangerous Liaisons. The film's only acting Oscar nomination, however, went to Ryder for Best Supporting Actress, which I felt was appropriate. Although May is the quietest of the three main characters, she is very much at the heart of the drama. (The innocence of the novel's title surely refers to her). As the film develops we realise that she might, in fact, be less naive and superficial, and more strong and determined, than she initially seems, making her a surprisingly complex character, and all these complexities are inherent in Ryder's performance. Another good performance in a supporting role comes from Miriam Margolyes as May's formidable grandmother Mrs. MingottThe film is visually sumptuous with strong, bright colours, especially reds, pinks, yellows and greens, much in evidence. Again, these are qualities one would not automatically associate with Scorsese's earlier works, which were often visually dark. (Raging Bull, for example, was largely shot in black-and-white). Since 1993, however, these qualities have been seen in some of his later works, especially his other period dramas Gangs of New York and The Aviator. The Age of Innocence can be seen as a fine example of Scorsese's skills as a film-maker. It is not entirely typical of his work- there is less physical action than in many of his films- but it perhaps seems less untypical today than it did in 1993. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"16 August 2012","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" In the early nineties Martin Scorsese's reputation was largely that of a maker of tough, gritty and violent films about the underworld or modern-day urban street life, often with a maladjusted, anti-social loner at their heart.
