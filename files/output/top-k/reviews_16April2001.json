The only thing I really enjoyed about this movie was the soundtrack, which had some great hip hop and r'n'b songs on it, and the dancing was fun to watch. I found the plot a little too mixed up for my tastes - the movie tried to cover a lot of issues (a white girl fitting into a black neighbourhood, lack of opportunities for people living in such a neighbourhood, bi-racial relationships, being a teenage single mother and the death of a parent) but I felt it just skimmed over them briefly as sub-plots to try and add some substance to a pretty thin story. I found the whole movie a rather unsatisfactory affair, with nothing really being resolved apart from the movie's heroine, Sara, being accepted at top dance school Julliard. The acting wasn't bad, but I felt Julia Stiles was miscast as Sara - she didn't seem very comfortable with the role, and appeared rather stiff. There also seemed to be a complete lack of chemistry between her and Derek, her on-screen boyfriend, which, if it had existed may have made up for some of the movie's other shortcomings. Overall, a very schmaltzy, cliched affair with no real substance or anything (except for the soundtrack) worthy of merit. A huge disappointment.

Joaquin Phoenix as Max California offers himself as a side-kick of sorts, and the chemistry between the two is excellent. Max shows Welles things that Welles will never again be able to un-see.

This film really made me think about what a perverse world we live in. About the sick and twisted terrors that some people engage in on a daily basis.

So why did I keep wishing that it would end?  Why the nagging desire to get up and stretch my legs?I think there's a shortage of glee.  The premise is simple three men discover a crashed aeroplane full of money in the woods, and instead of alerting the authorities, they make what seems to be the not-quite-morally-wrong decision to keep the cash for themselves.  Their simple plan is just to keep the money at Hank's house until all is clear.  But first one thing goes wrong, then another, and they find themselves committing crime after crime in a hopeless attempt to cover up the crime before.All the twists and turns and fatal errors are presented with such a dreadful earnestness, as if Raimi isn't enjoying the story, and doesn't want us to enjoy it, either.  Odd that this should be so.  Army of Darkness (made just five years earlier) was a masterpiece of over-the-top glee - a tale of treachery, selfishness, incompetence and necromancy presented with joyful, lip-smacking relish.  Here Raimi goes to the other extreme.  The material demands an arch treatment, a sense of humour - I mean, yes, the cruel twists of fate are tragic, but they're funny as well - yet Raimi's direction casts a wet blanket over every scene, and it's hard to have any fun.  Something tells me, too, that the film is too long.  In the hands of, say, Billy Wilder, the film would have been snappier, and all the better for it.  Some directors have the ability to keep the camera running on sparse, drawn-out scenes in such a way as to make them fascinating; Raimi, on the evidence presented here, doesn't.What (considerable) skills Raimi does have often work against the film rather than for it.  Note the scenes in which people get drunk.  Many directors can present people being drunk; Raimi can take is INSIDE their drunkenness - but this was a mistake.  Have you ever been drunk in uncongenial company?  There comes a moment when one suddenly becomes disgusted with everything, unable to bear one's drinking partners, and more profoundly bored than it is possible to be while sober.  That's what several of the characters feel at certain points; and that, unfortunately, is what we feel too.A noble attempt to tell a good story, fitfully successful, but it just isn't much fun to watch.

So why did I keep wishing that it would end?  Why the nagging desire to get up and stretch my legs?I think there's a shortage of glee.  The premise is simple three men discover a crashed aeroplane full of money in the woods, and instead of alerting the authorities, they make what seems to be the not-quite-morally-wrong decision to keep the cash for themselves.  Their simple plan is just to keep the money at Hank's house until all is clear.  But first one thing goes wrong, then another, and they find themselves committing crime after crime in a hopeless attempt to cover up the crime before.All the twists and turns and fatal errors are presented with such a dreadful earnestness, as if Raimi isn't enjoying the story, and doesn't want us to enjoy it, either.  Odd that this should be so.  Army of Darkness (made just five years earlier) was a masterpiece of over-the-top glee - a tale of treachery, selfishness, incompetence and necromancy presented with joyful, lip-smacking relish.

Never would a instructor beat his troops, or be so racist, etc. So please don't judge the military or the Marine Corps by this movie - IT IS NOT VERY REPRESENTATIVE OF THE MILITARY\/BOOT CAMP - THEN OR NOW. For the most extent, that sort if thing didn't happen, and it's all a figment of Hollywood's imagination. This also applies to the recent 2001 reality series called Boot Camp on FOX TV. Even though the Drill Sergeant's are real, they would never do most of what they do on the show in real life. So much for my rant - I just don't like when people watch this movie and think that is what the military is like, because it's really not.Other than that, the movie is pretty much factually correct.It's a good, classic war film - well worth seing. You won't be disappointed. If you like this movie - you will also like Heartbreak Ridge with Clint Eastwood. It's also a funny 'Drill Sergeant whipping his troops into shape' kind of movie.

We can see Selick's signature all around and works perfectly well; he might not had written the screenplay, but he actually directed very well.Besides the film portrays the duality that lies within each one of us, the good side and the dark side, each one represented by Stu Miley (S-Miley) and the latter by his alter ego-created character monkey bone. What I founded more interesting was that even though the film is full of silly scathological jokes, has a blend of dark humor that makes those jokes not merely for children but impossible not to laugh. Another side of the film I loved was the downtown, where the souls of the people in coma lie. It was a marvelous, ridiculous and yet nightmarishly fun place, where I might as well be in case I fell in a coma.It is absolutely not a philosophical film, nor a film that will be remembered in the future, neither a film that will set the new standards for future films; but it works well for what was intended, transport the audience into another world deep inside our heads and play with life and death in a funny way. Also be surprised by the cameo appearance by some famous novelist specialized in horror.

I want everyone reading this to know that it's over.  You've killed it.  It's not funny anymore.  I am of course talking about `mullet humor', and it must be stopped.  A while back, mullets were kind of an in-joke, a kitschy piece of odd humor that only some people understood.  Today, It's gotten so out of control that people think any odd haircut classifies as some type of  `mullet cut', and that the word itself is inherently funny.  The relentless overkill of this novelty has sucked the very last fleck of humor and camp-fun out the `mullet humor' genre.   Gee, this reminds me of another genre that is bereft of life  one-dimensional character driven comedies starring `Saturday Night Live' has-been's and never-will-be's that plague the theaters. The new disaster `Joe Dirt', pathetically combines these two dying trends.  When will they stop?  I mean, on the poster for `Joe Dirt', it says, `FROM THE PRODUCERS OF 'DEUCE BIGALOW  MALE GIGOLO', like it's some kind of selling point.  In the back of my mind, I hoped people would learn from such flops as `Little Nicky' and `The Ladies Man'. But somehow David Spade and executive producer Adam Sandler manage to squeeze out this piece of crud.  It's the kind of movie you scrape off the bottom of your shoe, only to have the cat eat it and regurgitate it back up later on the living room floor.  But I'm being to nice. With no plot to speak of, let's just say that the whole movie is based around the fact that they'll hope you'll think Spade's mullet is funny for an hour and a half.  (movie spoiler  It's not!) Just when I thought I couldn't hate this movie anymore, Kid Rock shows up.  And only God know why.  Playing an illiterate redneck must have been a stretch for Mr. Rock. Adding insult to injury is the fact that Chris Farley's brother makes an eerie appearance alongside Spade, which to me was more tasteless than the repeated fart jokes. But the most disturbing fact of all, is that people around me in the theater laughed at this movie.  Note to David Spade    I liked this movie the first time.....whhhenn it was called....wait a minute.  I never liked this movie the first time.
