No doubt about it, the actors, the atmosphere, the story. It's good. But still this movie has a few problems. In general this movie is about the loneliness of people and their search for love and identity. It is brought to us from a very personal and warm point of view; the characters with which it deals vary from young children to very old people. SPOILER ALERT The first problem is with the characterization of the people in the movie, the old people and the young children are ok, apparently they have enough character in their faces and body gestures, on the other hand, the characters that are in the middle need to have a special gift for us to pay attention to them, they all have to be either a cab driver that is actually a writer that won't give in to his publisher or a whore that used to be a dancer and can play piano. I guess that ordinary people looking for love are just not interesting enough. Another problem is that the main character is not really living the American dream, all along the movie she is fighting to stay loyal to herself but eventually (I'm telling the end now) she I really happy only after she inherits a huge sum of money with which she buys a huge estate and opens a successful restaurant chain. All in all, it is a good movie, and the director certainly has a good eye, but there's still some maturing to do.

The sad thing is, these grievances could easily have been edited out of the film, as they have nothing to do with the main characters or their story whatsoever.The film is based on the novel by Sebastion Junger, which in turn was based on actual events. In 1991, a Gloucester swordboat and its crew were caught up in a convergence of three storm systems, and the book fictionalized this story  while attempting to make it as close to what might have happened as possible. Perfect Storm follows the same characterizations detailed in Junger's book, along with its story arc.As Perfect Storm starts out, the Andrea Gail, a fishing boat Captained by Billy Tyne, played by George Clooney, pulls into a harbor in Gloucester. His haul is pitiful, and unable to take the failure, he plans to set out in the coming days once again in order to prove he has what it takes he conquer the sea. He takes along with him his rag-tag crew of men, and together they set out towards the horizon on a doomed voyage.The main story itself is solid. It captures the hardness and loneliness of the lives these men live. The moments making up this tale are powerful. Although built on time-worn clichés, such as the two feuding crewmates who end up friends after one saves the other's life, its easy to see through this when presented with such scenes as when Clooney and his men learn that the massive pull of swordfish they have brought in will be rotten in a few days, as their ice machine has broken. Its strong writing like this that helps to transcend the shortcomings that plague the other parts of the film.When the Gail and her men try and speed back home to salvage their catch, they head straight into the middle of the titular storm. The effects here by Industrial Light & Magic are excellent, and the water effects they have created for the crashing waves and bouncing ocean are impressive. Although the computer-generated models for the boats and aircraft are not quite as well-done, for the most part the special effects are excellent and put to good use.The cast is good, but the performances are mixed. Clooney does well, and Mark Whalberg as Bobby, a young fisherman hoping to start a family with his girlfriend, is equally fine. John C. Reilly, William Fichtner and John Hawkes fill out the rest of the main crew, and are all serviceably decent.Michael Ironside makes a cameo as Clooney's rough boss, and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is also featured as a fellow swordboat Captain. Neither is given much to do, and it seems that they only exist in order to increase the number of useless sub-plots speckled throughout the course of the movie. Others include crewman Hawkes meeting with an overweight mother in the local pub and John C. Reilly leaving behind his young son, two occurrences which are almost never mentioned again.Other than these smaller plots which go nowhere, the chief problem with the film is that the main story is intercut with an even bigger useless sub-plot the tale of smaller rowboat that gets caught up in the raging storm, and the Coast Guard effort to rescue them. This is where Perfect Storm falters. Everytime the film cuts back to the Guard pilots attempting to rescue the tiny boat, and then save themselves, we're left wondering what might be happening to Clooney and his men. These scenes are superfluous in every way, only serving in one tensionless, overlong stretch to show us why Tyne and his crew are not going to be retrieved.During these scenes, it almost seems as if someone else is directing the movie besides Wolfgang Peterson. Best known for thrillers such as Das Boot and In The Line Of Fire, Peterson guides most of the film with a skilled, competent and secure hand. Clooney's haunting final scene, is the best of the movie, and when compared to the lackluster antics of the Coast Guard areas, it appears that The Perfect Storm is two different films, written and supervised by two different people.With some more coherent editing and a tighter script, Perfect Storm could have been a classic; however, as it remains, it is simply a good movie which could have been much better.Perfect Storm receives a 7.5 out of 10.

It is a fateful encounter, which tragically ends in a conspiracy to murder. Pauline's mother is intentionally killed by the two girls with a brick hid in a carrier bag, during an outing.Why did it have to happen? The movie answers this question in a long flashback which lasts until the starting point (the murder scene) is reached again.The two girls' friendship is unusual and exclusive. Pauline and Juliet only playfully include other persons in their world, famous contemporaries like Mario Lanza and Orson Welles, one as hero, the other as demon. Parents, teachers and other persons of their immediate vicinity are of lesser importance and become significant merely as objects of their mockery, like the clumsy tenant who lives in the house of Pauline's family and has the bad luck to fall in love with the girl. They are all denied access to their privacy. Therefore they do not even have the remotest idea of the existence of Borovnia, the dreamworld that the girls have created to escape from the troubles of daily routine. Diello, heir to the throne of Borovnia, becomes an ally in the fight against the lack of understanding of the others. When Pauline is interrogated on account of her alleged lesbian tendency, powers of imagination become so strong that the psychologist is killed by the sword stroke of the fiercely intervening Diello. And in the same way Diello comes to Juliet's rescue when, while being treated for tuberculosis in hospital, she is being plagued by a clergyman. He simply strangles him from behind so that his devotional words become inaudible.But when both girls' parents finally agree on separating the friends and sending Juliet to South Africa this fanciful method of confronting and eliminating the mischievous attacks of their fellow creatures does not work any longer and the continued existence of their salvaging fantasy world is seriously threatened. The conspiracy to murder is nothing but a desperate rescue operation in a state of emergency.

George Clooney being a manly man, gritting his pearly whites and saving lives. Hey, this ain't E.R, folks. This is a real-life action drama.You may have heard of the Storm of the Century that smacked into New England in 1991. You might also have heard of the Andrea Gail, a small fishing boat caught smack dab in the middle of it. Of course, you might also have watched the documentary on MSNBC before this movie aired, and therefore you know the ending anyway. Luckily for me, I kept myself ignorant (a planned action, I assure you!), and had no idea what the end result was for this movie. And no, I'm not going to tell you the ending. Sure, I know, it's not exactly a twist ending, and you could find out on your own if you wanted. So go ahead, find out. We critics don't give away endings. It's part of the Critics Society secret waiver we signed.Anyway, here's the tale in a nutshell. Billy Tyne (Clooney) is a grizzled fishing-boat captain who pilots the Andrea Gail, owned by Bob Brown (Michael Ironside). Seems Billy's had a run of bad luck lately, and when he and rival fisherman Linda Greenlaw (Mary Elizabeth Mastrontonio, not too far from The Abyss) return from a run, he's the one with the lesser load. Gritting those teeth and raising a fist, Billy returns to the deep a scant two days after leaving it, determined to find some damn fish.His plan is to go further than usual. I'm no cartographer, but I can tell you his plan was to go a ways, then go further than that, because that's where the fish are, by gum. So our old salt rallies his crew together, and off they go. And fish they catch! Big ones, and of course there's the requisite crewmen-who-don't-like-each-other, and a nasty old shark, and all sorts of hilarious hijinks, just the sort of stuff you'd expect to see (no pun intended) in a movie about deep-sea fishing.So they have the fish, and they're heading back home, and they're so damn happy, and WHAM! They find out they're heading into a big ol' horkin' storm. You've seen the commercials - this is what it's all leading up to. So they have a choice - turn around and go the long way (and lose their fish, which would spoil) or go through that nasty old storm? Guess which one Billy wants to do.Among the other cast members, Mark Wahlberg does a solid, commanding job as greenhorn Bobby Shatford and John C. Reilly is a treat as veteran sailor Murph. Karen Allen and Diane Lane are relegated to small, thankfless roles.Ar, ar, me hearties! Batten down yer masts! See Clooney rage madly at the storm like King Lear! Hey, look, folks, it's simple. You wanna see George Clooney be a tough guy? Here's your movie. You want a story and believable characters? Go see Yentl. I almost thought the sea was full of testosterone, since these guys seemed to be swimming in it. So pack up your grunts and belches, and have a blast with this escapist movie!

The sensuality of the lead actress and her new age beauty combined with time blurred impressionistic cinematic sensuality are very seductive.I was actually disappointed, especially because there is a lot of opportunity for a good modernist version of the hero - the sort of new age global playboy rooted in a more relaxed and funky turn of the millennium lifestyle, with a new age heroic story (the ethical dilemmas facing the new world), and contemporary cinematic techniques (e.g. blurring of boundaries between time, space and reality a la smirnoff).Unfortunately it almost seems as though all of this was aimed for, but just couldn't didn't 'gel' together very well -- but perhaps this is a master reflection of contemporary society in the way that it trying to gel and fuse past and the present around the millennial epoch, and how post-millennial society has yet to be fully formed.This resonates particularly deeply for Australia, because as Australia searches for a multicultural identity, it adopts, combines, and mixes all manner of backgrounds into a mix that has yet to congeal.Perhaps in 10 years time, this this perspective will become be apparent in retrospect.

It was pretty good.  Based in reality and more science fiction than fantasy I believed such a future could exist just around the corner.  Unlike many comic book adapted movies X-Men is not cartoony.  The spirit of the characters has been preserved although comic book continuity has not.  Although Anna Paquin (Rogue) could not sustain a Southern accent I sympathised with her ordeal as a confused young woman.  Hugh Jackman won me over as Wolverine (although he was not gruff enough or hairy enough) but I was disappointed with Sabretooth. What a wimp!!  Not vicious enough and to see him as Magneto's lapdog was embarrassing.  Mystique was pretty good but I do have one criticism here. Mystique is a shape shifter.  She takes on the appearance of something or someone else including their clothes etc.  When she becomes Wolverine and mimics his claws, the claws are still part of her flesh therefore when she battles the real Wolverine they would not break off as portrayed but would be sliced off an she would bleed.  It was interesting to see Toad as a major baddie.  I actually thought that he seemed the most powerful of the villains, quite the opposite of his rather lame comic book persona.  On the whole I recommend this movie both to the general public and to the fanboy, although I did think the action sequences were a bit weak by comic book standards.  Watch for the cameo and background appearances of a multitude of marvel characters and enjoy the jibes and in-jokes if your a fanboy. Happy viewing.

The stars' characters were created with maximum screen impact in mind, and were to be retained (with minor adjustments) in Take Me Out To The Ball Game and On The Town.  Gene Kelly plays Joe Sea Wolf Brady, the twinkle-eyed Irish womaniser who never quite seems to get a woman.  Clarence Brooklyn Doolittle, Sinatra's screen persona, was put together as a blatant attempt to pander to his bobbysoxer following.  He is the bashful, slightly geeky ingenu, pushing his cuteness for all it's worth - the romantical type fella.     Anchors Aweigh set the pattern for a whole assembly line of MGM musicals to come, and one could almost say it established an art-form.  Kelly did the choreography, and his first-ever 'dream ballets', two of them, are on display here - the famous pas de deux with Jerry The Mouse, and the Zorro interlude.  The dance sequences are brimming with innovative ideas - mixing human action with animation, artistic use of slow motion, 'playing' the items on the craft stall and bouncing on the beds in the servicemen's hostel.     MGM itself appears, almost as a character in the movie, with self-indulgent shots of the art deco facade and the bustle of the back lot.  Jose Iturbi, the Spanish musical director contracted to MGM at the time, plays himself in a slightly odd role.  He is the big noise at the studio whom Aunt Susie is anxious to impress, and in a bid to give the meandering storyline some cohesion, he opens the film conducting the Navy band (this strange set-up is 'explained' in a later throwaway line he was brought in to tighten-up the Navy's musical style).  There are two problems with giving Iturbi an important role in the movie - one, nobody has ever heard of Jose Iturbi, and two, his Valencian accent is so strong that it renders him virtually unintelligible.  But anyhow, Iturbi conducts the said Navy band, and then an orchestra on the MGM sound stage, playing a Rhapsody In Blue rip-off.  He presides over Aunt Susie's auditon, and plays some classical stuff at the keyboard (including an interesting Hungarian Rhapsody at the Hollywood Bowl, with massed pianos).     The plot (if that is not too choate a term for it) goes thus an aircraft carrier puts in at San Diego, and two sailors are given shore leave.  They encounter a little boy who leads them to his pretty Aunt Susie, a taco joint chanteuse who dreams of the big time.  Without giving the game away, I can reveal that more than one person falls in love Susie, leading to the customary complications and misunderstandings.  The energy and exuberance of the performances, and particularly that of Kelly, carry the madcap action along nicely, and the eccentricities of a storyline which goes from mariachi groups to Tom And Jerry don't seem so very outlandish after all.  This new brand of musical comedy, breaking completely with the pre-war conventions of tuxedos and ocean liners, is attractive and refreshing.     Young Mister Sinatra, under a separate contract from the others, sings numbers specially written for him by Jules Styne and Sammy Cahn.  By far the best of these formulaic boy-crooner ballads is the final one, I Fall In Love Too Easily.  Throughout the film, Frank sings in his upper register, aiming for a light ballad sound, and consequently not doing any justice to that reedy baritone voice.     The film has attractive visual gimmicks, quite apart from the man-and-cartoon-mouse stuff. Iturbi plays a transparent keyboard, shot from below.  In a clever comment on the storyline, Joe rises from the table and physically comes between Clarence and Susie.  The string section of the orchestra is filmed playing pizzicato in the reflection of Iturbi's grand piano.     Katherine Grayson is more than adequate playing the female ingenue, and her voice is spectacular, if a little too showy and operatic.  The screen test is a knockout coloratura performance.       The film falls away a little towards the end.  The Hollywood Bowl is incorporated, one feels, merely to give the movie a photogenic location to use, and this passage distorts the storyline somewhat.  The fallings in and out of love are totally arbitrary, and the resolutions hurried and thin.

Robert Wise did a excellent job with the story and the direction was perfect.  I first saw this film in school as it made an impression on me with its sad and tragic ending for it is Tony's death that brings peace between the Sharks and the Jets.  West Side Story is the perfect movie for the hopeless romantic all over the world.

It is also a great musical that is filled with great acting and breathtaking music.  The film could be considered as a continuation of Rebel Without A Cause(1955) with the appearence of Natalie Wood.  Natalie Wood gives the performance of her life as Maria and Rita Moreno is terrific as the girlfriend of Bernardo.
