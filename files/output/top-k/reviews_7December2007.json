The first is the criminal who commits his crimes as a sort of intellectual exercise and then plays games with the police by deliberately leaving them clues. In reality, of course, most criminals are motivated either by greed or by strong emotions such as anger, hatred or jealousy rather than by the desire to commit the perfect crime for its own sake; Leopold and Loeb may have been exceptions, but even they were not stupid enough to taunt the police in the manner of some fictional criminals. The second cliché of which the film-makers are guilty is that of the twist, the sudden revelation of information, previously withheld from the audience, which makes them aware that the true situation is not what they had previously been led to believe. Such twists normally occur towards the end of the film, and often involve the disclosure of information about the identity or motivation of one or more of the characters.The modern fashion for the pseudo-intellectual criminal, who commits crimes so that he can play a sort of mental chess with the detective, seems to have started with The Silence of the Lambs (in itself a reasonably good film). This fashion was followed in weaker films such as the overrated Se7en and the predictable The Bone Collector. The villain in Along Came a Spider is not (as in the examples quoted above) a serial killer but a kidnapper. His real name appears to be Jonathan Mercusio, but in the film he is normally referred to by his alias Gary Soneji. Soneji poses as a teacher in order to infiltrate an exclusive boarding school and kidnap the daughter of a senator. Soneji, who is obsessed with the Lindbergh baby kidnapping case from the thirties, then contacts the police to let them know what he has done and to give clues as to the girl's whereabouts. The title of the film derives from a comparison made between Soneji and a spider.The investigation of the crime is entrusted to Alex Cross, the Washington Police Department detective originally contacted by Soneji, and Jezzie Flanagan, the female Secret Service agent who was assigned to protect the girl and who failed to prevent her kidnapping. Like Jezzie, Cross is haunted by guilt, in his case over an earlier incident in which a female partner was killed. Like The Bone Collector, Along Came a Spider teams an older African-American male detective with a younger white female one. In both cases the female character has an Irish surname (Donaghy in the earlier film).Morgan Freeman is a highly talented actor, as he showed in films such as Driving Miss Daisy, Glory and Unforgiven, but his talents are often wasted in routine thrillers; Along Came a Spider is an example, and his next film High Crimes another. (Freeman also played the detective in Se7en; I have not seen Kiss the Girls, the other film in which he played the role of Alex Cross). Monica Potter gives a rather wooden performance as Jezzie; she is not as good as Angelina Jolie, who played the equivalent role in The Bone Collector, and certainly not as good as Jodie Foster in The Silence of the Lambs.I won't say what the twist is that occurs near the end of the film, as I don't want to write a spoiler, although I must say it is not a credible one. Indeed, it has the effect of casting doubt on most of what has gone before, converting a believable if routine thriller into one that makes no sense at all. (John Schlesinger achieved a similarly dubious feat the previous year in Reindeer Games, which featured not one but two separate twists). The writers of crime fiction, especially scriptwriters for films like this, generally have far more fertile imaginations than do the criminals themselves; consequently fictitious criminals tend to hatch over-complicated and unworkable schemes which no real-life criminal would entertain for a minute.

Not that I'm saying it was horrible or that it was the best thing to hit horror cinema, what I am saying is that it seemed a bit too cheesy and b-movie-ish. It wasn't scary as much as it was disturbing, but at the same time it seemed like a comedy and there were many points where it was a bit too over the top. The acting was descent, the cinematography (special effects and lighting) where way over the top, the plot was worn out and the scares were replaced by some good laughs. It was not the original and it had far more impossibilities than any other Tobe Hooper film I have seen. In this case, Texas Chainsaw 2 was okay and worth watching.First off, the acting was okay, it wasn't Oscar worthy but it certainly wasn't the worst acting I have seen. Bill Moseley, who plays Chop Top, does a real good performance capturing the demented and mentally damaged war veteran who has an obsession of transforming the theme park into NamLand. Ken Evert, was okay and did a somewhat good job recapturing the personality of the grandpa from the original, but in this movie he ads a bit more comic relief (i.e. the people he cuts up is used for award winning Chile). Dennis Hooper, whom I'm surprised to see, did a fairly silent and random character that is out for revenge. Now, giving the fact he was brilliant in Easy Rider, this film was a step below his acting career. In the movie he seems a bit over the top (when he goes nuts with the chainsaws), and at points seemed as if he did this for fun. In this film, Leatherface was not a maniac that had faces resemble his personality, but seemed more like a young boy who has fallen in love and throws temper tantrums. This reworking of Leatherface, to me, proved to be a disaster and a step below the personality of the original killer.The plot is vastly different from the original; basically a radio hostess hears a brutal murder over the phone and is later kidnapped by the very same cannibalistic family. A renegade cop searching for redemption is proved to find the culprits even if it means destroying the entire place with duel chainsaws in a spaghetti western style showdown. However, some of the stuff that could have been vastly scary or disturbing turned out to be a bit funny and gross. They try to bring back that iconic scene from the original with the old man and the hammer, but this one backfired and proved to be comic rather than horrific. Some things that made this plot line seem a bit too unnatural was the use of some extreme impossibilities that was used in this film. Examples like standing up on a car and killing people in the other vehicle with chainsaw, a skinless man walking and talking and having two huge chainsaws hanging from a belt. They seemed so cheesy and out of the blue that it was enjoyable. It was just way different from the original and I guess that is okay.The one thing that I really like that the other one did not have was the extreme use of camera angles, lighting and tone of the film. These aspects were so over the top that it made up for some of the poor audio and music. The lighting, especially at night, were very colorful and high contrast and seemed to have come straight out of a comic book. In the radio building there was a high contrast of shadowy reds when Moseley's character appears, even higher tones of red and splashes of green when Leatherface appears. In numerous hallways there was dim lighting with obtuse red, green, yellow and blue shapes and oranges in the main dining hall.

Not that I'm saying it was horrible or that it was the best thing to hit horror cinema, what I am saying is that it seemed a bit too cheesy and b-movie-ish. It wasn't scary as much as it was disturbing, but at the same time it seemed like a comedy and there were many points where it was a bit too over the top. The acting was descent, the cinematography (special effects and lighting) where way over the top, the plot was worn out and the scares were replaced by some good laughs. It was not the original and it had far more impossibilities than any other Tobe Hooper film I have seen. In this case, Texas Chainsaw 2 was okay and worth watching.First off, the acting was okay, it wasn't Oscar worthy but it certainly wasn't the worst acting I have seen. Bill Moseley, who plays Chop Top, does a real good performance capturing the demented and mentally damaged war veteran who has an obsession of transforming the theme park into NamLand. Ken Evert, was okay and did a somewhat good job recapturing the personality of the grandpa from the original, but in this movie he ads a bit more comic relief (i.e. the people he cuts up is used for award winning Chile). Dennis Hooper, whom I'm surprised to see, did a fairly silent and random character that is out for revenge. Now, giving the fact he was brilliant in Easy Rider, this film was a step below his acting career. In the movie he seems a bit over the top (when he goes nuts with the chainsaws), and at points seemed as if he did this for fun. In this film, Leatherface was not a maniac that had faces resemble his personality, but seemed more like a young boy who has fallen in love and throws temper tantrums. This reworking of Leatherface, to me, proved to be a disaster and a step below the personality of the original killer.The plot is vastly different from the original; basically a radio hostess hears a brutal murder over the phone and is later kidnapped by the very same cannibalistic family. A renegade cop searching for redemption is proved to find the culprits even if it means destroying the entire place with duel chainsaws in a spaghetti western style showdown. However, some of the stuff that could have been vastly scary or disturbing turned out to be a bit funny and gross. They try to bring back that iconic scene from the original with the old man and the hammer, but this one backfired and proved to be comic rather than horrific. Some things that made this plot line seem a bit too unnatural was the use of some extreme impossibilities that was used in this film. Examples like standing up on a car and killing people in the other vehicle with chainsaw, a skinless man walking and talking and having two huge chainsaws hanging from a belt. They seemed so cheesy and out of the blue that it was enjoyable. It was just way different from the original and I guess that is okay.The one thing that I really like that the other one did not have was the extreme use of camera angles, lighting and tone of the film. These aspects were so over the top that it made up for some of the poor audio and music. The lighting, especially at night, were very colorful and high contrast and seemed to have come straight out of a comic book. In the radio building there was a high contrast of shadowy reds when Moseley's character appears, even higher tones of red and splashes of green when Leatherface appears. In numerous hallways there was dim lighting with obtuse red, green, yellow and blue shapes and oranges in the main dining hall.

Men and boys have dominated this premise since H.G Wells, but Kathleen Turner takes it back following the success of 1985's Back to the Future. Turner looks like a hot mom and then a hot high school senior. How is that possible? Casting and probably some fairly rigorous exercising. Nick Cage really is a youngster who looks more 18 than 40. But the story is all about Peggy Sue and the strange situation she finds herself in as she relives her 1960 senior year and gets the benefit of perfect hindsight. I think all will agree that the scenes with Peggy Sue's grandparents (who are of course long dead to the 40 year old Peggy Sue) are very touching. It's inconceivable that a film marketed for a teen audience would include these scenes. Just the mention of grandparents to a 15 year old is enough to get them heading the other direction. But even when I watched this as a 15 year old I was moved. Only an adult would truly appreciate the wisdom of their elders. But by the time we are adults our grandparents are gone. It's as true as the sky is blue. But Peggy Sue gets to take advantage of her time travel and seeks her grandparents out. The brilliance of the writing is apparent as the grandparents end up playing an important role in the plot and general moral of the story. Imagine that! There are a few gimmicks in the script such as the Beatles song and Hemingway references and the Edsel car, but these are minor. The bulk of the story is firmly planted in Peggy Sue's ability to change her 17 year old decisions based on 25 years of disappointments.So she isn't actually going back in time (occupying the same space as her 18 year old self) as actually RELIVING the past with the memories of her adult self. There is a big difference. She's got the experiences of a 43 year old woman but is now in the body of her 18 year old self.But Francis Ford Coppola gets the credit for absolutely brilliant directing. From the opening mirror shot to the closing mirror shot his framing and editing choices are superlative. They are miles apart from what most directors were doing in 1986. This guy is a genius with the camera. There are so many cinematic references in here I can't begin to name them all. Charlie's spooky shadow a'la Lon Chaney as he sneaks up to Peggy Sue's bedroom is one that stands out. And check out the shadows in the Physics Lab. That's no accident. Make no mistake about this movie, it is a real work of art. The premise is not as serious as Apocalypse Now but the execution is just as direct and effortless. That's what strikes me about this movie every time I watch it Much effort went into the execution of these scenes even though the scenes themselves don't merit much effort. We're talking about kids at a party singing Doo Wop songs. Why go through the bother of blocking and multiple takes and multiple angles? This is marketed for children and Coppola is spending production dollars. But I'll be darned if Turner didn't get nominated for an Oscar for this role. Give Coppola the credit for not making a disposable movie.The score is employed well and the attention to details pays off on an emotional level. Turner isn't weak because she ultimately can't go through with her radical changes, she basically surrenders to a destiny that she can't escape from. Her children will only exist through her decision to stay with Charlie. Her surrender is what ultimately sets her free. But did she actually relive her life? Or was it a dream? You can speculate either way. The important thing is the lessons she learned from her experience. It can be summed up in one word Strudel.

Visually it is striking and highly unique, a collage of metal, junk, urban decay and flesh, an artistic style that is very eye-catching.

But here Lynch makes it exciting in his suspenseful way and with the actresses he chose for the roles, Watts and Harring. When 'Betty' gets to Hollywood and she has great place to stay and a smashingly good audition I started to question the reality and was tempted to go to sleep at this point. But Lynch turns it around completely with all the hits that this is a dream world and in the end shows it to be only a fantasy. The reality is that she came to LA and failed miserably and were it not for the Diana's sexual interest in her and petty parts given her she would have either went packing back to Canada or ended up as a hooker.

Tommy Lee Jones character says it all in that quiet whisper that turns into an ugly argument when he tells his wife his mission is and has always been from the beginning to sell arms to countries such as her country. So it gets you thinking about what war is really about. Obviously the soldiers are trained to follow orders and not think about or question those orders. That would result in discharge. And for many in the war it dragged on for years on end and eventually people realize the pointlessness of it. How can the supposed most powerful nation on earth loose a war? You can break their backs with superior technology but you can't break their spirit. And you can never completely eradicate a poor people from their own country. There will aways be a resistance no matter how small. So you can never really win. It's like the old school yard bully who beats up on all the small guys. But as long as people despise the power and strength of the arrogant and evil bully there will always be resistance until the bully eventually pulls back and his pride injured. This has happened throughout all of history in all the world empires. Why is it we believe we are something different? This movie in someways gets you to think about that. Could it possibly be that we are the ones to blame? That we are where the problems started? But of course no one wants to consider that when it is so much easier to and cowardly to blame other people.

Something goes wrong though & Solo refuses to kill innocent civilians which Colonel Frank Madden (William Sadler) isn't happy about, back at base & General Haynes (Barry Corbin) orders Solo to be shut down & reprogrammed. One of Solo's main directives is self preservation so decides to escape back into the South American jungles where Colonel Madden & his men are sent in to recapture it...This Mexican American co-production was directed by Norberto Barba & one has to say Solo is awful. The script by David Corley was based on the novel 'Weapon' by Robert Mason & is one cliché after another, robots were popular at the time Solo was made in Hollywood & at the box-office so Solo rip-offs the likes of Robocop (1987), Universal Soldier (1992) & the two Terminator flicks as well as having the same setting & basic story as Predator (1987). This is the usual rubbish about an emotionless robot who grows a sense of humanity while being around people, at first he doesn't know what a joke is or why one person would care for another but by the end he develops emotions & starts to befriend people, sounds like Terminator 2 Judgment Day (1991) to me. The character's are poor & Colonel Madden in particular is given absolutely no motivation for hating Solo at all & why he would kill other US soldiers & disobey orders to destroy it. You know I saw this on cable telly last night for free (thank god I didn't spend any money on it) & I looked it up in the TV guide & do you know what it said? My TV guide described Solo as a 'dire sci-fi action starring Mario Van Peebels' which when I think about it is a perfect description of Solo. In less than ten words my TV guide has hit the nail on the head, I mean it's a sci-fi action film, it certainly stars Mario Van Peebles & it's definitely dire. Enough said really.Director Barba doesn't do anything particularly special here & the action scenes lack any real excitement & the sci-fi elements are virtually none existent apart from the fact Solo is a robot. So the military lose Solo & Colonel Madden is sent in to recapture it right? I'm not being funny but wouldn't the military have put a 'self destruct' mechanism inside Solo in case something like that happened? Surely at the very least Solo would have had a tracking device inside it so the military would at least know where it was at any given time? I'm not being funny but these people can come up with a walking talking robotic soldier but they are not clever enough to realise that a tracking or self destruct device might be useful if anything went wrong? The violence is mild, there are a few OK fight scenes but this is pretty weak stuff really.Technically the film looks alright & is competently made, it was actually shot in Mexico. The makers of the Dolph Lundgren action flick Agent Red (2000) edited footage from Solo into that film. The acting is poor, Van Peebles was the perfect choice to play an emotionless robot... William Sadler deserves better than this, it was only a few years prior he was staring in the fantastic Die Hard 2 Die Harder (1990).Solo is a really bad sci-fi action flick which is basically a huge rip-off of big budget Hollywood sci-fi action films like Robocop, Universal Soldier & the Terminator films. Not recommend & I'm going to start & pay more attention to my TV guide when it comes to choosing films to watch...

This is the usual rubbish about an emotionless robot who grows a sense of humanity while being around people, at first he doesn't know what a joke is or why one person would care for another but by the end he develops emotions & starts to befriend people, sounds like Terminator 2 Judgment Day (1991) to me. The character's are poor & Colonel Madden in particular is given absolutely no motivation for hating Solo at all & why he would kill other US soldiers & disobey orders to destroy it. You know I saw this on cable telly last night for free (thank god I didn't spend any money on it) & I looked it up in the TV guide & do you know what it said? My TV guide described Solo as a 'dire sci-fi action starring Mario Van Peebels' which when I think about it is a perfect description of Solo. In less than ten words my TV guide has hit the nail on the head, I mean it's a sci-fi action film, it certainly stars Mario Van Peebles & it's definitely dire. Enough said really.Director Barba doesn't do anything particularly special here & the action scenes lack any real excitement & the sci-fi elements are virtually none existent apart from the fact Solo is a robot. So the military lose Solo & Colonel Madden is sent in to recapture it right? I'm not being funny but wouldn't the military have put a 'self destruct' mechanism inside Solo in case something like that happened? Surely at the very least Solo would have had a tracking device inside it so the military would at least know where it was at any given time? I'm not being funny but these people can come up with a walking talking robotic soldier but they are not clever enough to realise that a tracking or self destruct device might be useful if anything went wrong? The violence is mild, there are a few OK fight scenes but this is pretty weak stuff really.Technically the film looks alright & is competently made, it was actually shot in Mexico. The makers of the Dolph Lundgren action flick Agent Red (2000) edited footage from Solo into that film. The acting is poor, Van Peebles was the perfect choice to play an emotionless robot... William Sadler deserves better than this, it was only a few years prior he was staring in the fantastic Die Hard 2 Die Harder (1990).Solo is a really bad sci-fi action flick which is basically a huge rip-off of big budget Hollywood sci-fi action films like Robocop, Universal Soldier & the Terminator films.

She also has some amazing powers, which she doesn't realize at first.However, Matilda's parents and brother are a bunch of jerks. They are stupid, they have no brain, they only care about watching television, they have no culture or motivation to read and they openly despise Matilda and even mistreat her for being intelligent. But Harry (the father) is the worst of the three. Matilda's brother is a dork, the mother is unemployed and plays bingo daily, while Harry sells overpriced crappy cars.And yet, Matilda makes friends easily at school and has the teacher any student would like to have the kind-hearted Miss Honey - she is not only a beautiful person but also hot. However, the school principal, Agatha Trunchbull, is a real monster. She dresses like a Nazi, she is an ex-Olympic champion and she is a horrible woman. The way she treats children is awful and the way she talks about them is disgusting.Miss Trunchbull's creepy punishments include throwing kids into the air or out of the window, grabbing them and let them fall on the ground with no mercy, yelling at them, threatening them and even locking them in the chokey (which is scary as hell). They can't even breathe in her presence. And she is cruel for the kids even for no reason at all.One of the creepiest lines by Miss Trunchbull is «Some rats are gonna die today...»Mara Wilson steals the show as little Matilda.

Angel Heart is one of those films that matures with age and grows on audiences and film connoisseurs alike. A psychological horror\/thriller is one of the hardest genres for a director to prosper in but if you were to mix in spiritual and religious elements along with a heap of film noir, a touch of romance and a smidgen of jazz then you would set yourself a near impossible task, nevertheless it would be a task in which Alan Parker would succeed.The direction of this film is masterful as Parker engages us through a meticulous atmosphere littered with mysterious allegories, gut rendering paranoia and an unmatched sense of place. This unmatched sense of place is a symptom of his stark imagery and sombre lighting which is played out through an amalgamation of film noir and the focal iconography of 50s and 60s French New Wave (the use of elevators, ceiling fans, staircases etc).For many of these reasons and more Angel Heart is a very influential film and its inspirations can be seen in many of the psychological thrillers\/horrors released in the past 20 years, it is thought provoking and at times a lot more disturbing than any of its genre equivalents. The multi-faceted love scene in the film is one such example, it plays very well as it is cleverly interspersed with a host demonic echelons which (given its style and narrative position) I believe to be unparallelled, even in contemporary cinema.Overall Angel Heart is a very well paced and well acted film &#150; although initially I felt that having Mickey Rourke in the lead role was a poor choice (based on his more recent work) but clearly he was at his acting best in his younger days almost Oscar-worthy, Robert De Niro is also on form as is the young Lisa Bonet &#150; but these performances combined with everything else make Angel Heart a film that will stick with you, not as much as Midnight Express or Mississippi Burning (dir.

Strongly showing how both sides felt, the families of the murdered as well as the families of the convict, the convict himself, and others involved. It stayed on topic of showing the horrors of the crime itself, rape & murder, how bad they were\/are, but without showing (distinguishable) nudity.Some bad language, but none was in a place where it would not truly have been much worse in real life. (That is the convict used some inappropriate language, but I'm sure that was lessened in the movie than in real life as opposed to most movies today where filthy language is added or emphasized cuz they think we viewers want to hear it.) I very much dislike any bad language, and I was not offended by this. When you talk to a convict, you will hear some. And I don't recall any other roles using bad language.I also saw this movie listed as with the female nudity category. It was not close-up, so this too was depicted well and in taste, in accordance with the movie. When showing dead bodies, all nudity was essentially not shown since what was shown was from such a distance. Even the rape scene was kept as clean as could be, in my opinion. Good for picky & clean movie watchers such as myself. I understand the movie is about rape & murder since it is so directly related to the topic. And all is depicted in a very appropriate manner, well, as a nun probably would condone. I am disgusted with nudity in modern shows, but I don't even consider what little nudity the show did include to even effectively be nudity. I personally would not classify it in such a category.A number of cute side-line funnies too. My favorite was when Helen Prejean was pulled over by the officer & his comments to her. But you'll have to watch it yourself; my comment is a non-spoiler in every regard.

If you like the series, you will probably like this film. Although I consider the TV show to be somewhat ridiculous, I enjoyed its plot-orientation, classy production, often sophisticated writing, and the relationship between the protagonists - Mulder and Scully. The film gives its audience more of the same, but elaborates nicely on Scully and Mulder, and amplifies the production values by an order of magnitude.Despite the somewhat convoluted mode of presentation, the story is pretty simple. Mulder and Scully have uncovered a cover-up involving a deadly extra-terrestrial virus, which is a precursor to a much bigger problem presided over by the mysterious secret uber-government the show so often hints at. A lot of questions are answered less ambiguously than the series normally offered, and a few new ones surface before the lengthy, action-oriented climax. Duchovny plays Mulder exactly as he did on TV, but Gillian Anderson adds impressive depth to Scully. Martin Landau gives a nice supporting performance as Mulder's questionable informant. The directing is a touch above the TV show's standards, as is the cinematography. And the special effects are much better than what XF fans are used to. Too bad they didn't have Angelo Badalamenti for the soundtrack. The story does one difficult thing very well - it fits within a long story-arc from the TV show quite nicely and yet manages to operate decently as a stand-alone story as well. Despite this the film is even more absurd and paranoiac than the TV show. Major suspension of disbelief required, but worth the effort if you like the show, or enjoy wholly fictional conspiracy theory. Had it not followed the standard S-Files TV show formula, X-Files - The Movie, might have earned a 7 instead of a 5 from me.

But the secret this inferno burned free was far more frightening that any picture Hollywood could produce. A sanitarium of slaughter supervised by a surgeon gone mad ,Richard Benjamin Vannacutt(Jeffrey Combs). Little known today but likely the most prolific mass- murderer of this century. He out-butchered Bundy. He made Manson look meek. And the site of this carnage still exists today, restored almost to its original state. But it has yet to be inhabited, because some say the spirits of Vannacutt and his victims still live within the walls of the House on Haunted hill. The magnate named Price(Geoffrey Rush) arranges shocks guests(Taye Diggs,Ali Larter, Peter Gallagher,Chris Kattan,Bridgette Wilson) along with his spouse(Famke Janssen). He invites them to the haunted former insane asylum and offers them a million of dollars if they can stick it out for the complete night. But soon supernatural creepiness begins frightening the hosts.This eerie tale packs horror, grisly killings and lots of blood and gore. It's silly but good fun and with an excessive use of computer generator FX and special make-up in charge of Robert Kurtzman, Howard Berger and Greg Nicotero(appears a cameo as roller-coaster technician). However I miss the first version's gimmicks,such as a full-size skeleton(dubbed Emergo) leap from the screen and descend on cinema-goers along a hidden wire. The film is lavishly produced by Dark Castle , production specialized on terror genre and in charge of Joel Silver,Robert Zemeckis and Gilbert Adler. The motion picture is professionally directed, without originality by William Malone. He's a TV episodes director(Masters of horror,Tales of crypt, Freddy's nightmares) and occasionally cinema director(Feardot.com,Creature). Rating Acceptable and passable but with no novelty.
