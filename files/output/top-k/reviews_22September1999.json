This is a very difficult and emotional movie that I highly recommend to everybody.  The movie is more about the characters and their eccentricities than anything else.  Kevin Spacey does make the movie, though.  It is very real, funny, sad, and tangible.Acting- Top of the line.  You actually believe that Kevin Spacey is pulling himself out of the rut, and going through his mid-life crisis.  You believe that a woman like Annette Bening can be so vapid and empty, while finding her happiness.  Everybody acts the way that they are supposed to.  But, the shining star was Wes Bentley as the next-door neighbor.  Although I think that the video helps him to remember as well as to hide from the real world.  Everything looks distant through a camera.  On the other side, everything is vulnerable and exposed.  Thus creating real feelings and thoughts come out.  Story-Interesting take on people's search for happiness.  The other really good one solely on the subject that I have seen is Happiness, which is much much darker, and more depressing.  This movie ends up to be a beautiful movie with a beautiful ending.  No, i am not sick for thinking that, but it was fitting and realistic. The neighbor also went through his own change and transformation, which means that the movie is all inclusive in shells, and the search for happiness.All in all, i think that this is what Hollywood does best.  This is a great movie, that is only feel good once you intrepret it.  Hollywood should learn how to make movies that let you feel what you want.  People can be saddened by the movie if they want, i was cheered.  Plus, the movie was just so well done that everybody should see it.  However, do not expect anything or learn the plot.

That's all you really need to know.  All I can say is that this is hands down one of my favorite films ever.  I think anybody between the ages of 20 and 45 has some kind of attachment to this movie.  We all know at least one of the characters really well (that is, we all have somebody in our personal cliques, or have forged friendships with at least one person who is characterized in this film).  The ambience and atmosphere of high school is perfectly captured by Linklater, from the parties, beer drinking, pot smoking, keggers in the woods, cars, subgroups and general outlook that high schoolers have.  They live for the most part, for the here and now (except for Matthew McConaughey's Wooderson who  desperately clings to his past). I've read other reviews which dwell on the film's non existent plot.  No statement about the film can be further from the truth.  There is not so much a conventional plot as there is Linklater's desire to make you reflect upon your own high school years.  For those few who can't see it, are you aware of the parallel betwen Pink and Mitch???  Mitch gets paddled just like Pink did (They got me right after Little League practice.).  Is it merely coincidence that Mitch winds up hanging out with Pink and his crew that evening; or how easily that group of seniors accept Mitch??  I don't think so.  For me, Dazed and Confused is a bookmark in the pages of my life (despite the fact that I graduated high school 11 years after the film takes place).  Its not just what you see, but even more so, what you don't see. You relate to the good times each person\/group has had (both past and current) although you're not even there.
