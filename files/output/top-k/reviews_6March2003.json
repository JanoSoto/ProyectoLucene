What is interesting is that most of the people who didn't like this film seemed to be more upset at being misled than at the actual movie being bad.  Wendigo is being marketed like it's a horror monster movie.  When you read the back of the video rental box, it actually says that a family gets relentlessly pursued by an evil force or creature of some kind through the woods.  I don't consider it a spoiler at all if I say right now that Wendigo is not a monster movie.  Wendigo isn't even really a horror movie, at least in terms of what we're led to believe when looking at the poster art and plot summary.I rented this film late on a Saturday night, and watched it alone with the lights out after getting into the proper frame of mind.  I knew nothing about the story except for what I read in the video store.  What I expected to see was a disturbingly gory monster flick with hopefully decent acting and production values.  As soon as the movie started I knew I was in for something much different, something more psychological and character driven.  I was pleasantly surprised to say the least.Wendigo is a very good film, although it does have scenes that run too long and the overall pacing is a little off.  It starts with a family driving to a vacation house down a long back-country road through the winter woods.  They end up hitting a deer that was being chased by hunters.  One of the hunters, a rugged redneck named Otis, feels more than a little insulted and humiliated by the city slickers ruining his fun.  He gets into an argument with the father, which leads to some spooky and tragic events later in the film.Not much can be said about the storyline, mainly because there isn't a whole lot that actually happens in Wendigo, at least in terms of action and plot twists.  This movie is more about developing the characters and setting a spooky atmosphere, which I believe was handled very well.  Wendigo may not be a horror movie in classic terms, but it does have a unique creepiness to it, an unsettling feeling that exists from the opening scene until the very last.  This sense of dread was maintained quite consistently and always kept me interested.When viewed as a drama\/thriller with subtle supernatural undertones, Wendigo is an extremely engrossing film.  The acting is great.  The family relate and react to each other very realistically.  The dialogue is all well written and well performed.  I was very impressed overall with how realistic the movie was in general.  The characters all seemed like real people, and were not just stereotypes stolen from other films of this kind.On the back of the rental box for Wendigo, it says that it's a cross between 'The Shining' and 'Deliverance'.  That is quite misleading as well.  Although the storyline at certain points could resemble minor parts in either of those two films, I would have to say that Wendigo has more in common with the old Sam Peckinpah classic 'Straw Dogs' than it does with anything else.  In that movie you had a mild-mannered Dustin Hoffman, staying with his wife at a house they were newly renovating.  The carpenters they get to do the work end up having a confrontation with Dustin, which leads to a bloody and violent climax that is unforgettable.Similar to 'Straw Dogs', the father in Wendigo has to deal with the threat of physically imposing men harming his family.  He's a lover not a fighter, but feels the pressure of facing his own masculinity and weaknesses as a man.  Being out in the woods and out of your element, surrounded by the wild nature of man and beast, can be a scary situation when you're feeling threatened and the safety of your family is at stake.  Although not nearly as good as 'Straw Dogs', Wendigo does manage to explore these themes in a refreshing way.Wendigo also has some beautifully creepy scenes.  There are several shots of trees and wooded areas that are both spooky and stunning.  The director of this film definitely knows how to handle a camera, especially when shooting montages of the surrounding wilderness to further enhance the scare factor.  One scene in-particular, when the spirit of the Wendigo looms over a family chopping bloody deer meat and they all freeze in suspended animation when the presence is sensed, is simply incredible.There are of course negative comments to be said about Wendigo, and many of them that have already been said here I can somewhat agree with.  The script gets weak near the end, and the climax does come pretty quickly without you realizing that the movie is almost over.  That's not such a bad thing though, as when it was done I was wanting to see more because I was really getting into it.  But the ending could have used some work, no arguments there.Just ignore the advertising for Wendigo and watch it with an open mind.  I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of the story and the overall creepy vibe it had.  Give it a try.

However you could say it's the other way round. Both these films are based loosely on the film culture of Wuxia, with 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon' taking a more traditional approach. The Wuxia genre can be analogised the story of a swordsman or knight, who is able to mentally break away from the physical world and therefore defy gravity and the limitations of the human body. These people were highly feared and glorified as noble swordsman who fought not for state or lord but for themselves but were however honest, compassionate and loyal.

Ang Lee Lee has however created a martial arts masterpiece, one of the best scene for many years. It may come as a surprise however none of the scenes in 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' are computer generated, all the stunts performed were on wire, especially the scene where Li (Chow Yun-Fat) and Jen (Ziyi Zhang) fly through the trees, that really is them, flying through the trees. The directing of a movie with some many aspects, love, action, can be an overwhelming task, however for the most part Lee has successfully created an entertaining film. The script sets up an intricate storyline, full of interesting characters and events, however there is one particular, part of the film that seems to go for too long, which is the desert flashback. It might have been wise to remove some of these scenes as most are simply not needed, perhaps a single fight in the desert would be enough to establish the abilities and feelings of the characters, however the section goes for a few too many minutes, leaving you wondering when are we going to get back to the main plot. Aside from that the acting is excellent from the main characters, actors have been well chosen for these characters, and dialogue is also very well written and presented, a compliment to the writers and actors. It is unfortunate that this film did not reach its full potential, not it was a bad movie, but because people were daunted because of the 'foreign film branding' as well as the long love story, even though the film was first and utmost a love, not action story. This is also disappointing as the love story seems shallow and stereotypical, two people who cannot truly be with each other, but in the end express their love for each other, and I'm not going to even say in how many movies I have seen two enemies fighting, rolling on the floor to end up in each others embrace. However these few problems are more than overwhelmed by an excellent cinematographic style, and great performances.

In the final movie he ever made, 'Eyes Wide Shut', he pushes the envelope for how much sexual content can be contained in one movie, in addition to what makes a movie that little bit different. This is a movie that has to be seen, with your 'eyes wide open'.Consumed by betrayal and jealousy, wealthy Manhattan doctor Bill Harford's comfortable world is turned topsy-turvy when his wife's lascivious sexual fantasies about another man, lead him into a dangerous underworld of sexual ritualistic obsession. This erotic foray threatens to ruin his marriage -and may even ensnare him in a lurid murder mystery.This movie is a very slow and long experience, and perhaps that is reason why you have to appreciate it so much. In many Hollywood movies, you get a standard formula, that does not do anything that I would call is 'new'. But with this film, you have to take in all of its aspects that it contains, meaning you have to be very patience while watching it.That being said, Kubrick was another of the world's unique directors, in that he would have wanted every shot to be just the way he wanted. This movie is no different, in that you can see Kubrick's perfectionism really coming to the fore. It is as if he was in love with every shot of the movie, which is like another of Hollywood's directors, Quinton Tarantino. Being the movie fan I am, it was a great shame that Kubrick died during the production of this movie, as I am sure he would have had some interesting movies left to do if he was still alive today.Eyes wide shut's story comes from the novel 'traumnovelle' by Arthur Schnitzler. The story itself is very confronting, looking at some challenging issues. The movie then takes that a step further, with the screenplay written by Kubrick and Fredrick Raphael, what I would call 'mind-boggling'. The issues of sex, infidelity, marriage and danger are all painted in such a way that the audience needs to ask the same questions of themselves, with some of us I'm sure not able to confront theses issues. Yet Kubrick plays with the audience making some issues so real, seem as if they are just a joke. The story to this movie is as original as you will see.The stars of the movie are undoubtedly former Hollywood couple Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. They share a weird, but funny chemistry onscreen, as we get to see how frail a marriage they are in. I have no doubts that this project would have placed a great strain on their 'real' marriage, and was in some way responsible for the demise of their relationship. For Cruise, his role is different, as in almost every shot he looks vulnerable and about to breakdown. The pair go off to a party hosted by Victor Zielger (Sydney Pollack) that starts to show them in situations that could jepardise their marriage. However the best part of the movie comes the night after the party when Alice (Kidman) accuses her husband of cheating on her. She is so stoned, that she is being unreasonable, with Bill (Cruise) almost in tears, unable to defend himself. The shocking confession from Alice then rips Bill's world apart.  What follows will be debated for alongtime to come, as you are not sure what is real, and what is not.'Eyes wide shut' has many fascinating elements, which include the sexual content, with Kubrick not holding back on what he wanted the audience to see. The female form becomes something that is not 'arousing', instead it is just normal. The rating that this movie was given, I am sure hurt it, because of the use of digitally animated sexual characters. Although they are hardly noticeable, the vision that Kubrick would have wanted to show us, would have been tainted it a little. Lights are used to great effect in the movie with the colours of the 'rainbow' so apparent. I believe this is to show off the obvious sexual tone of the movie's story. It is clever to see the rainbow effect in a couple of camera shots. While it is subtle, it can be quite noticeable if you look hard enough.This movie also has an amazing soundtrack.

The standout song from 'Eyes Wide Shut' has to be Chris Issak's hit 'Baby did a bad bad thing', which is one of the highlights of the entire movie for mine.The majority of the film has a 'dreamlike' effect to it, and it is difficult to tell what is in reality and what is not. It asks many questions that I am sure we have to work the answers to ourself (such as did Alice have an affair with the naval officer or was it only ever a fantasy?

If it was not, can the Harford's marriage really survive, after such turbulent events?) That being said, it has taken three viewings of this film for me to actually like it. It is a film that people will either 'love or hate'. Someone said that Kubrick might have had an incite into the main stars immanent marriage problems, and perhaps he did.

In the final movie he ever made, 'Eyes Wide Shut', he pushes the envelope for how much sexual content can be contained in one movie, in addition to what makes a movie that little bit different. This is a movie that has to be seen, with your 'eyes wide open'.Consumed by betrayal and jealousy, wealthy Manhattan doctor Bill Harford's comfortable world is turned topsy-turvy when his wife's lascivious sexual fantasies about another man, lead him into a dangerous underworld of sexual ritualistic obsession. This erotic foray threatens to ruin his marriage -and may even ensnare him in a lurid murder mystery.This movie is a very slow and long experience, and perhaps that is reason why you have to appreciate it so much. In many Hollywood movies, you get a standard formula, that does not do anything that I would call is 'new'. But with this film, you have to take in all of its aspects that it contains, meaning you have to be very patience while watching it.That being said, Kubrick was another of the world's unique directors, in that he would have wanted every shot to be just the way he wanted. This movie is no different, in that you can see Kubrick's perfectionism really coming to the fore. It is as if he was in love with every shot of the movie, which is like another of Hollywood's directors, Quinton Tarantino. Being the movie fan I am, it was a great shame that Kubrick died during the production of this movie, as I am sure he would have had some interesting movies left to do if he was still alive today.Eyes wide shut's story comes from the novel 'traumnovelle' by Arthur Schnitzler. The story itself is very confronting, looking at some challenging issues. The movie then takes that a step further, with the screenplay written by Kubrick and Fredrick Raphael, what I would call 'mind-boggling'. The issues of sex, infidelity, marriage and danger are all painted in such a way that the audience needs to ask the same questions of themselves, with some of us I'm sure not able to confront theses issues. Yet Kubrick plays with the audience making some issues so real, seem as if they are just a joke. The story to this movie is as original as you will see.The stars of the movie are undoubtedly former Hollywood couple Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. They share a weird, but funny chemistry onscreen, as we get to see how frail a marriage they are in. I have no doubts that this project would have placed a great strain on their 'real' marriage, and was in some way responsible for the demise of their relationship. For Cruise, his role is different, as in almost every shot he looks vulnerable and about to breakdown. The pair go off to a party hosted by Victor Zielger (Sydney Pollack) that starts to show them in situations that could jepardise their marriage. However the best part of the movie comes the night after the party when Alice (Kidman) accuses her husband of cheating on her. She is so stoned, that she is being unreasonable, with Bill (Cruise) almost in tears, unable to defend himself. The shocking confession from Alice then rips Bill's world apart.  What follows will be debated for alongtime to come, as you are not sure what is real, and what is not.'Eyes wide shut' has many fascinating elements, which include the sexual content, with Kubrick not holding back on what he wanted the audience to see. The female form becomes something that is not 'arousing', instead it is just normal. The rating that this movie was given, I am sure hurt it, because of the use of digitally animated sexual characters.

The way this movie begins, the story which it tells, even the music that it uses,   is all original, and will catch its audience &#145;off-guard' if they are not watching properly. Films such as &#145;Braveheart' and &#145;Gladiator, have to be applauded for what has been done to make them. &#145;A Knight's tale' is another one of those cinematic experiences that deserves the same respect from its audience. William Thatcher is a peasant with dreams of competing in champion jousting. When the opportunity strikes for him to feign royal descent and compete in the famed sport, he discovers the thrill of winning, the glory of knighthood, the love of a forbidden maiden and a terrible danger in the form of the vile Count Adhemer. William Thatcher didn't make the rules. He was born to break them. Much of the credit for this movie belongs to its &#145;writer, producer and director', Brian Helgeland, who wrote a wonderful script, and directed it in a most unique way. I am of  the thinking, that Helgeland deliberately placed certain things in this movie so that his audience would say it is quite illogical. Music out of our era that would never have been thought of in a medieval time, the mannerisms of the characters, who talk just like we do. Then as a change of pace he transforms the story back into the medieval times. Not many movies are game enough to do such bold things, but Helgeland pulls it off. The only downer to his script was the corny and contrived love story. In my opinion it held the story back, instead of making it an integral part of the film. The main character in the story is Sir Ulrich Von Lichtenstein, AKA William Thatcher (Aussie Heath Ledger). Heath was the perfect person for this role. I am sure that his performance in the film &#145;the patriot' would have been a major influence as to why he got the part. His performances in both films were great. Supporting Ledger is a fine cast. These include Thatchers sidekicks such as Roland (Mark Addy) and Wat Falhurst (Alan Tudyk), who are both funny in many parts of the film. Tudyk is very versatile actor, who can play almost any role. Then what about the writer Geoffrey Chaucer (Paul Bettany)? His role was a very demanding one, and once you have watched the film, you will understand what I am talking about. Jocelyn (Shannon Sossamon) is the beautiful maiden that our hero wants so badly. While Shannon is good looking, I found her role to be nothing that special. Don't get me started on another of her films, '40 Days and 4 Nights'. That film is just &#145;bad'. The character which challenges William the most is Count Adhemer (Rufus Sewell). I enjoyed the way Ledger and Sewell gel well  together onscreen, with their rivalry another of this movies highlights.  With the counts line of &#145;You have been weighed, you have been measured, and you have been found wanting. In what world could you possibly beat me?' Just brilliant, and builds up their competitive streak all the more.  There are many scenes that I liked from this movie. The Jousting scenes are done in such a way that gives the movie great suspense and tension. With the jousting, the more that I saw, the more I anticipated for the next jousting match. Other scenes that I liked include almost all of Geoffrey's scenes, with his spruiking extremely funny. The letter writing to &#145;my dearest Jocelyn' is very humorous. The reply William gets is just great. The scene where William meets up with his father after many years later is another wonderful look at the love the pair still have for each other.  I also like the sets to this movie, as it gave it a grand style. I feel it had the right look all the way through the entire movie. Yet this films strongest talking point has to be in its soundtrack. For mine, the mix between a traditional musical score and today's contemporary modern rock worked is done extremely well. The soundtrack includes such hits as  &#145;Taking care of business', by Randy Bachman, &#145;The boys are back in town' by Thin Lizzy and David Bowies &#145;Golden Years' (which is cleverly incorporated into a dancing sequence for the movie) make for a wonderful soundtrack. However, it is &#145;We are the champions' sung by Robbie Williams and Queen, and another of Queen's songs, &#145;We will rock you', which is used particularly well, giving the film great power and strength. I have seen many &#145;medieval movies' that have described what an era that time was. But by doing a movie which mixes both history and the current day, while risky, was done in such a stylish way here that I really liked. I also like the advice a young William gets from his father after stating that one day he will become a Knight. William asks &#145;Can it be done father, can a man change the stars?' His father replies, &#145;Yes William, if he believes enough, a man can do anything.' I believe that this is true for anyone in life. Jousting in the medieval days was a brutal sport, not unlike how we take our sport today. In Australia, we are fanatical about many sports and put our bodies on the line, just like the Knights do in their jousting matches. I am not sure what genre this film should be, perhaps an &#145;action, comedy, musical, medieval-adventure', and if you can find me a film like it, then I would like to see it .

The way this movie begins, the story which it tells, even the music that it uses,   is all original, and will catch its audience &#145;off-guard' if they are not watching properly. Films such as &#145;Braveheart' and &#145;Gladiator, have to be applauded for what has been done to make them. &#145;A Knight's tale' is another one of those cinematic experiences that deserves the same respect from its audience. William Thatcher is a peasant with dreams of competing in champion jousting. When the opportunity strikes for him to feign royal descent and compete in the famed sport, he discovers the thrill of winning, the glory of knighthood, the love of a forbidden maiden and a terrible danger in the form of the vile Count Adhemer. William Thatcher didn't make the rules. He was born to break them. Much of the credit for this movie belongs to its &#145;writer, producer and director', Brian Helgeland, who wrote a wonderful script, and directed it in a most unique way. I am of  the thinking, that Helgeland deliberately placed certain things in this movie so that his audience would say it is quite illogical. Music out of our era that would never have been thought of in a medieval time, the mannerisms of the characters, who talk just like we do. Then as a change of pace he transforms the story back into the medieval times. Not many movies are game enough to do such bold things, but Helgeland pulls it off. The only downer to his script was the corny and contrived love story. In my opinion it held the story back, instead of making it an integral part of the film. The main character in the story is Sir Ulrich Von Lichtenstein, AKA William Thatcher (Aussie Heath Ledger). Heath was the perfect person for this role. I am sure that his performance in the film &#145;the patriot' would have been a major influence as to why he got the part. His performances in both films were great. Supporting Ledger is a fine cast. These include Thatchers sidekicks such as Roland (Mark Addy) and Wat Falhurst (Alan Tudyk), who are both funny in many parts of the film. Tudyk is very versatile actor, who can play almost any role. Then what about the writer Geoffrey Chaucer (Paul Bettany)? His role was a very demanding one, and once you have watched the film, you will understand what I am talking about. Jocelyn (Shannon Sossamon) is the beautiful maiden that our hero wants so badly. While Shannon is good looking, I found her role to be nothing that special. Don't get me started on another of her films, '40 Days and 4 Nights'. That film is just &#145;bad'. The character which challenges William the most is Count Adhemer (Rufus Sewell). I enjoyed the way Ledger and Sewell gel well  together onscreen, with their rivalry another of this movies highlights.  With the counts line of &#145;You have been weighed, you have been measured, and you have been found wanting. In what world could you possibly beat me?' Just brilliant, and builds up their competitive streak all the more.  There are many scenes that I liked from this movie. The Jousting scenes are done in such a way that gives the movie great suspense and tension. With the jousting, the more that I saw, the more I anticipated for the next jousting match. Other scenes that I liked include almost all of Geoffrey's scenes, with his spruiking extremely funny. The letter writing to &#145;my dearest Jocelyn' is very humorous. The reply William gets is just great. The scene where William meets up with his father after many years later is another wonderful look at the love the pair still have for each other.  I also like the sets to this movie, as it gave it a grand style. I feel it had the right look all the way through the entire movie. Yet this films strongest talking point has to be in its soundtrack. For mine, the mix between a traditional musical score and today's contemporary modern rock worked is done extremely well. The soundtrack includes such hits as  &#145;Taking care of business', by Randy Bachman, &#145;The boys are back in town' by Thin Lizzy and David Bowies &#145;Golden Years' (which is cleverly incorporated into a dancing sequence for the movie) make for a wonderful soundtrack. However, it is &#145;We are the champions' sung by Robbie Williams and Queen, and another of Queen's songs, &#145;We will rock you', which is used particularly well, giving the film great power and strength. I have seen many &#145;medieval movies' that have described what an era that time was. But by doing a movie which mixes both history and the current day, while risky, was done in such a stylish way here that I really liked. I also like the advice a young William gets from his father after stating that one day he will become a Knight. William asks &#145;Can it be done father, can a man change the stars?' His father replies, &#145;Yes William, if he believes enough, a man can do anything.' I believe that this is true for anyone in life.

In The Last Crusade's case, it's plain and simple fun escapism, and never has Hollywood movie magic achieved the rousing exhilaration that the third Indy movie has done for me.Then there's the other, more complex reason I see movies, to be enlightened, thought-provoked, challenged, and inspired, all of which The Shawshank Redemption accomplishes and more. Back in 1994, I would have thought someone was pulling my leg if they told me a prison drama starring Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins (the latter of whom I had never even heard of at the time) would endure as one of the most popular films ever. Now, I'm just kicking myself for never having seen the film in theaters.Tim Robbins stars as Andy Dufresne, a banker who's been sentenced to consecutive life terms in prison for the murder of his wife and her lover. His first year is in 1947, and from this point on, we're introduced to several other characters and situations over the many years that pass, Dufresne's developing friendship with Red (Morgan Freeman), and his becoming a mentor to a hotheaded thief (Gil Bellows), all of which culminate to a masterful conclusion which sharply delivers the film's message.What is that message, you might ask? Why, it's all about hope, about what we do with our lives. To most, living is hell, a harsh reality that involves pain and endurance. But if we take charge of our very own existence, appreciate everything we have and can accomplish, then the very process of living can be wonderful. Even the most cynical people I know still love this movie, a grand statement for just how powerfully effective it is. The plot may not sound interesting to the uninitiated (take my word for it, I first saw this film when I was a 14-year old with the attention span of a fly, and the movie still gripped me like no other), but it fits perfectly with the themes at work, and much of the dialogue is so beautifully written, the film simply demands repeat viewings to gather it all.Frank Darabont adapted the script from Stephen King's novella, keeping much of the story lines and dialogue verbatim, while making a few crucial changes, for the better, believe it or not. Darabont's direction is equally as terrific, keeping things low-key and seemingly unexceptional, but truly crafting something memorable and brilliant. Thomas Newman's remarkable score is emotionally touching and uplifting, perfectly fitting with the movie's tone.But great as the direction and writing may be, what puts this over the top for me are the performances. Everyone here is excellent, without the slightest minor exception. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins deliver the best, most powerful performance of their careers in crafting two of the most memorable characters in cinema, with the former proving why he's the greatest actor around and the latter showing why he's one of the more underrated performers. The film is primarily about the friendship between Dufresne and Red, how a man can bring hope to a cynic in even a place as confined as Shawshank Penitentiary. In supporting turns, James Whitmore and William Sadler are exceptional as prisoners who befriend Dufresne. Sadler, in particular, begins the film as a total ass, and it's to his credit that by the end, his transformation to a genuinely likable character is entirely believable. Even Gil Bellows is excellent here, and anyone who's seen Ally Mcbeal knows he typically defines bland.The Shawshank Redemption's ending is, quite simply, fabulous. Everything about the final half-hour is perfect, from the big surprise twist to the pacing to the music to the acting right down to the very final scene. I'm probably sounding a bit repetitive by now, but everything about the conclusion (much as the rest of the film) is pure genius. There are flaws in The Shawshank Redemption, most particularly why Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown never appear to age over the years that go by, but such a minor mistake isn't even worth muttering to the overwhelmingly positive attributes the film bears.

There are flaws in The Shawshank Redemption, most particularly why Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown never appear to age over the years that go by, but such a minor mistake isn't even worth muttering to the overwhelmingly positive attributes the film bears. The Shawshank Redemption is the perfect film, and I'm absolutely certain nothing will ever match it, much less surpass it.

And movie makers too often overreach themselves and fall into the trap.  (As Good as it Gets has a dog crying in one of the sad scenes.)

As for silliness, well, somewhere on the slope of that pit lies The Brady Bunch and its sequels, and, near the bottom perhaps, The Jetsons.What About Bob? teeters on the brink of the Brady Bunch Pit at times but never topples over.  The story is the kind that a committee might come up with if asked to choose a topic for a family comedy.  Guy becomes attached to his psychiatrist, follows him on vacation, makes a nuisance of himself, but brings family together and all ends happily.  Plot number sixteen in the shoebox labelled funny plots.  Actually, this is done pretty well.  The opening sequences poke some obvious fun at Murray's phobias, and there's an amusing scene in Dreyfus's office.  Murray claims that he left his wife because -- There are two kinds of people in the world.  Those who like Neil Diamond and those who don't.  Dreyfus, the shrink, is in therapist pose, cheek propped on the palm of one hand, and he replies something like, Let me see if I understand this.  You're a multiphobic, compulsive anxiety neurotic, and YOU left HER because she likes Neil Diamond?  Once the superficial jabs are out of the way the writers have to work harder, otherwise what they've got is a one-joke plot that has to be strung out over an hour and a half.  The tactic they use is to shift the attention away from Murray's symptoms and focus instead on small-group dynamics.  And they do it successfully.None of the situations, none of the gags themselves, are breathtakingly funny but they are all consistently amusing.  Dreyfus's family bonds with Murray at their house in New Hampshire.  They come to appreciate his endearing child-like quality.  He moans with pleasure over Julie Hagerty's fabulous dinner, teaches Dreyfus's son how to dive and how to stop worrying about death, entertains the daughter, and all the while driving Dreyfus to distraction just by being there.  (Ooops, watch out!  That slope is slippery.)  Finally crazy, Dreyfus attempts to blow Murray up by tying him to a log in the forest and draping twenty-two pounds of black powder over his shoulders, set with a timer to explode in an hour or two.  Dreyfus succeeds only in blowing up his own house, which he filched with a bag full of money from a local couple anyway.  And Murray's character is engagingly dumb.  Dreyfus is his reluctant host at the family dinner.  Hagerty offers Murray another piece of chicken and Murray accepts with fulsome gratitude.  As he takes the chicken, Murray notices that Dreyfus looks up from his plate glaring at Hagerty, and notices too that she scowls back at him.  Completely misinterpreting this exchange, Murray asks Dreyfus, Did you want the breast?  Later Dreyfus marches Murray off into the woods with the intent of killing him, and Murray asks if this is some new kind of therapy.  Yes -- death therapy.  It's a sure cure.  Funny, right?  However, in real life it is no fun to live with someone as neurotic as Murray.  It's a condition that demands a great deal from others.  Trust me on this.  I speak not only as someone who had to live with a neurotic for years, but as a neurotic myself.  Fortunately this movie depicts nothing that resembles real life, where Murray would be more or less disabled by his psychopathology and would find very little to be cheerful about.  (The baby steps therapy, insofar as it's described at all, resembles a technique borrowed from operant conditioning and called desensitization.  It seems to have had a pretty good success rate with phobias.)  If you want a serious undertone you can probably find it in the relationship between Dreyfus and his family.  He's a rich, narcissistic workaholic who, as his daughter informs him, is no longer fun to be with.  He's reduced to a neural shambles by the end of the movie and recovers during a wedding ceremony, but the whole family doesn't rejoice and come together for a weepy group hug, thank God.The plot is so obvious that much of its success rests with the actors and they pull it off.  Murray has often been painful to watch, as if he thinks that vacant smile is itself amusing.  But he does a good job here.  And so does Dreyfus as the straight man who is turned into a figure of laughter.The kids can watch this and they'll probably get a kick out of it.  You don't have to know anything about psychiatry because the jokes don't get into it.  Adults will probably enjoy it too.  Nobody will pop a gasket laughing, but the film is consistently amusing.  These days, that in itself is enough to make anyone tear up with thanks.

","genre":"Drama, Music, Musical"},{"date":"6 March 2003","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  *This review may contain spoilers, so if you'd like to be surprised, enter at your own risk*I think my opinion on this film differs greatly from most of the opinions.  I personally was greatly disappointed by this film, and I think that the primary reasons lie in the fact that four separate writers were credited for the film.  I have heard the claim that the deer hunting scenes are metaphors for the loss of innocence, and that the Russian roulette scenes are metaphors for the random horror of life.  If this is the case, the least Cimino could have done is construct these scenes well enough that they are made real to the audience, rather than contrived, which, unfortunately, they do.  While the marathon wedding sequence is a true work of art, and every scene in Welch's Tavern is amazing, that bittersweetly poetic ending feels forced in light of how disgustingly much the Russian roulette and hunting gimmicks smack of smug, pseudo-profound 1970s Hollywood. Contrary to most reviewers, I find De Niro's brilliance not in the extravagant displays of emotion during the games of Russian roulette and in the finale, but rather in his quiet restraint and distance stateside.  Also contrary to most critiques of this film, while I am riveted to Christopher Walken whatever his film, he seemed to skate to his Oscar on presence alone, as his character arc was inexplicably assumed rather than effectively shown.

Yet in the 1993 drama, &#145;My Life', our hero is facing the end of his life, and doing it in the best way he can. The world we live in today is full of people who are dying from cancer just like Bob Jones, but no movie has showed what a struggle it is. Here is a movie that does not shrug away from any of the underlying issues Bobs has to face, as he is living his final days. We all need to watch this film and cherish what an experience it really is.  Meet Bob and Gail Jones, a happily married couple expecting their first child, who are passionately devoted to one another. But tragedy strikes their otherwise untroubled middle-class home when Bob learns he has advanced terminal cancer. Faced with this profound crisis and the realisation that his child may never know him, Bob decides to make a video documenting his life so that his son will have some knowledge of his father. Creating the video proves to be an emotionally and mentally Herculean task, as Bob discovers he is as shallow as the public relations material he produces for a living. Before he can successfully complete the video, Bob has to make peace with himself, reconcile with his estranged parents, and accept what is happening to him is inevitably going to kill him.What a great story for a movie. I like the way we see Bob Jones struggle through the entire movie, as I am sure that is how it is for all cancer victims. The story is also beautifully filmed, with the shots where Bob is making up the video for his son, done exceptionally well. This movie was written and directed by Bruce Joel Rubin, and was his directorial debut. I feel that this story had a part of his own life within it, (his mother, Sondra, was in the film and the film is dedicated to her memory), but in no way did this take away from the viewing experience. In fact, I feel that it enhanced it all the more. The movie stars two wonderful actors in Michael Keaton and Nicole Kidman. They share a very unique bond on this movie as you really believe they are in love. They also show that they are struggling with what ultimately will be the end of their fulfilling marriage. Keaton's performance is one of his best, as I feel he was a great choice to play Bob. I like how we see that Bob is filled with anger towards his family, especially his parents (which would have to be contributing to how sick he is becoming). The scenes we see with Bob's family are great, as they build real tension, and show that Bob's life is not content as it needs to be. Other important characters in &#145;My Life' include the Chinese healer, Mr. Ho (Haing S. Ngor), who tells Bob that he needs to get his life in order, before it is too late. Bob is unsure how to take the healer, accusing him of &#145;doing something'. Mr. Ho is a vital character to the final make-up of the movie. I also have to mention baby &#145;Brian' that Bob and Gail had. The twins, Brian and Andrew Camuccio, were great babies to use in the role of the Jones baby. Considering the point that the movie was at, their happiness helps to balance the sadness that is taking place as Brian's father is close to death. This leads to some of the great scenes in &#145;My life'. As I have said all of the video documentary scenes are great, as they give both the audience and Brian a great insight into the life of Bob Jones. The scenes that show Bob's anger towards his family are great, as we get to see that his life was not and is not what it should be. This is no more apparent than at Bob's brothers wedding reception, where he lets fly with some scathing attacks at his entire family. Yet it is also good to see that Bob has made peace with his family towards the end of the film, as he can finally rest in complete peace. The end of this movie, while it is difficult to watch, was a great and fitting conclusion. Showing Bob near to death and extremely sick, was a game move that I feel worked. I can understand people not liking it, but you have to be prepared to be confronted by this man's death, with death always being confronting in any movie or circumstance.  In closing this is a movie I will always return to when I want to get &#145;my life' back into some sort of prospective, as it helps you to make sensible choices about your future. It points out to its audience that we should all appreciate life while living on this earth. If we don't, we run the risk of dying an unfulfilled life. I never had the chance to meet my mum's mum, as she died before I was born. In a way I am glad I did not see her before she died, because she died a most unpleasant death, from smoking related emphysema. So from watching this movie, I can imagine what her last few days on this earth would have been like. I also like the way that baby Brian, keeps Bob's legacy alive, as he is a happy child, just his Dad was before he died. The tagline to this movie is so true, when it comes to the end of human life, &#145;every moment counts'. We all need to do this, as we never know when our last day on this earth could be upon us.

I've also been a big fan of the origanal Robert E. Howard stories for a long time now, reading many of them over and over again.The movie and the books are different.  There are also a lot of themes from the movie that are taken straight out of the books.  As we examine them be warned about the SPOILERS!First off, Conan's village and parents were never massacred before his eyes as portrayed in the film and Conan was not put into slavery at that young of an age. 'The Thing in the Crypt' (Lin Carter and L. Sprague De Camp) tells us that Conan was enslaved at the age of sixteen during a raiding campaign with a band of the Esir against the Vanir and the Hyperboreans.His flight through the wilderness with a pack of hungry wolves after him is taken directly from 'The Thing in the Crypt', except that the skeleton in the tomb actually comes to life and Conan has to destroy it with his newly aquired sword.Conan becomes a thief in both the movie and the book but his first heighst is a little different.  In The Tower of the Elephant (Howard) it is the Heart of the Elephant, not the Eye of the Serpent which is the chief prize of the Tower; and it is guarded by a giant spider instead of a giant snake (although he fights giant snakes in more than a couple other adventures).The crucifixtion scene is taken pracicaly verbatum from A Witch Shall Be Born. Especially the part with the vulture.Conan never dies and is brought back to life in the origanal stories and it is the pirate queen Belit whoes love is stronger than death in The Queen of the Black Coast.  She is the one who comes back from the other world to fight by the side of Conan, not Valaria.In the books, Thoth-Amon is the prime evil Wizard that Conan must eventualy overcome, not Thulsa-Doom.Many of the themes we see in the movie aren't from the Howard stories at all.  Conan's search for the riddle of steel is completely made up for the movie.  And never was he taken to the East to be trained to fight like a Samuri (a stupid idea at first which  managed to turn out really well). Conan's fancy sword moves are practicaly a trademark.  Only Arnold could pull that off with a broadsword!Conan doesn't spend half of his life seeking revenge either.  Most of his motives in the books aren't that personal.  But this is a movie, not a serial.  If you want it to be an epic, you gotta have drama and a bigger sense of purpose.  However viewers who look closer at this film will find more than just a revenge story.  The main theme of the movie can probably be found in the quote at the beginning credits That which does not kill you makes you stronger.  But there are other morals as well.  Conan is a person who lives by a simple philosophy.  He doesn't have a disconnected fascination with the vague and mysterious like the brainwashed followers of Thulsa-Doom.  He represents the realistic side of our souls with his feet planted firmly on solid earth.  He gets what he wants by the sweat of his brow,  and gives honor and respect toward his heritage, unlike like the Children of Doom who look for paradise by shirking responsability and rebeling against their leaders; your parents; those who would call themselves your judges!  Those who have lied and corrupted the earth! supposedly.Aside from the in depth look of the movie, some other things that make this movie great are the costumes, scenery and a fantastic musical score. John Milius created a fantasy world as if it were a real historical time. Totally believable.  Anyone who likes fantasy will love this movie.  There just aren't as many good sword & sorcery flicks out there.The vikings verses the mongols and a battle to the death with and evil snake cult and you've got Conan the Barbarian.  Watch it.  I highly reccomend it.  Lots of blood and nudity though.  Catch it on T.V. if you have to. Oh yea, Conan's sword is way cool!

Conan's search for the riddle of steel is completely made up for the movie.  And never was he taken to the East to be trained to fight like a Samuri (a stupid idea at first which  managed to turn out really well). Conan's fancy sword moves are practicaly a trademark.  Only Arnold could pull that off with a broadsword!Conan doesn't spend half of his life seeking revenge either.  Most of his motives in the books aren't that personal.  But this is a movie, not a serial.  If you want it to be an epic, you gotta have drama and a bigger sense of purpose.  However viewers who look closer at this film will find more than just a revenge story.  The main theme of the movie can probably be found in the quote at the beginning credits That which does not kill you makes you stronger.  But there are other morals as well.  Conan is a person who lives by a simple philosophy.  He doesn't have a disconnected fascination with the vague and mysterious like the brainwashed followers of Thulsa-Doom.  He represents the realistic side of our souls with his feet planted firmly on solid earth.  He gets what he wants by the sweat of his brow,  and gives honor and respect toward his heritage, unlike like the Children of Doom who look for paradise by shirking responsability and rebeling against their leaders; your parents; those who would call themselves your judges!  Those who have lied and corrupted the earth! supposedly.Aside from the in depth look of the movie, some other things that make this movie great are the costumes, scenery and a fantastic musical score. John Milius created a fantasy world as if it were a real historical time. Totally believable.  Anyone who likes fantasy will love this movie.  There just aren't as many good sword & sorcery flicks out there.The vikings verses the mongols and a battle to the death with and evil snake cult and you've got Conan the Barbarian.  Watch it.  I highly reccomend it.  Lots of blood and nudity though.  Catch it on T.V. if you have to. Oh yea, Conan's sword is way cool! ","genre":"Adventure, Fantasy"},{"date":"6 March 2003","score":"4 out of 6 people found the following review useful","review":"  In writing this, I should start by stating that I love fantasy and sci-fi when it's done right and this is one of my favorite movies of all time. I've also been a big fan of the origanal Robert E. Howard stories for a long time now, reading many of them over and over again.The movie and the books are different.  There are also a lot of themes from the movie that are taken straight out of the books.  As we examine them be warned about the SPOILERS!First off, Conan's village and parents were never massacred before his eyes as portrayed in the film and Conan was not put into slavery at that young of an age. 'The Thing in the Crypt' (Lin Carter and L. Sprague De Camp) tells us that Conan was enslaved at the age of sixteen during a raiding campaign with a band of the Esir against the Vanir and the Hyperboreans.His flight through the wilderness with a pack of hungry wolves after him is taken directly from 'The Thing in the Crypt', except that the skeleton in the tomb actually comes to life and Conan has to destroy it with his newly aquired sword.Conan becomes a thief in both the movie and the book but his first heighst is a little different.  In The Tower of the Elephant (Howard) it is the Heart of the Elephant, not the Eye of the Serpent which is the chief prize of the Tower; and it is guarded by a giant spider instead of a giant snake (although he fights giant snakes in more than a couple other adventures).The crucifixtion scene is taken pracicaly verbatum from A Witch Shall Be Born. Especially the part with the vulture.Conan never dies and is brought back to life in the origanal stories and it is the pirate queen Belit whoes love is stronger than death in The Queen of the Black Coast.
