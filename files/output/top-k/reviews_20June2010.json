[{"date":"20 June 2010","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Widowed when his FBI agent wife is killed by a right-wing group, college professor Michael Faraday (Jeff Bridges) becomes obsessed with the culture of these groups - especially when his new neighbors, the all-American Oliver and Cheryl Lang (Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack), start acting suspiciously. With each twist, the mystery deepens and the question looms - is Faraday just consumed by fear and driven by paranoia, or has a lethal conspiracy been born on Arlington Road? asks the DVD sleeve.Director Mark Pellington and award-winning scripter Ehren Kruger make Arlington Road a fine thriller, from its gripping beginning to the edge-of-your-seat ending, it's entirely captivating. Mr. Pellington knows how to build suspense, and he elicits fine performances from a eclectic cast. Mr. Bridges' endearing paranoiac hero carries film - like he carries Spencer Treat Clark (as Grant) in the opening sequence. Doesn't that just grab you? Both frightening and neighborly, Mr. Robbins and Ms. Cusack reveal their hands slowly. Mr. Clark and Mason Gamble (as Brady) are genuine. Hope Davis (as Brooke Wolfe) and Robert Gossett (as Whit Carver) keep you guessing, even when you know what's going on. Only the Movie of the Week ending overreaches - not necessarily because it's an incredible idea, but because it's just not that kind of movie. This is, more simply, a crowd-pleaser.******* Arlington Road (3\/19\/99) Mark Pellington ~ Jeff Bridges, Tim Robbins, Joan Cusack, Hope Davis ","genre":null},{"date":"20 June 2010","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Widowed when his FBI agent wife is killed by a right-wing group, college professor Michael Faraday (Jeff Bridges) becomes obsessed with the culture of these groups - especially when his new neighbors, the all-American Oliver and Cheryl Lang (Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack), start acting suspiciously.
