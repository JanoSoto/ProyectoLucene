I like where he's coming from, and he shares much of the same taste as me a liking for the offbeat, the Gothic, a love for the Hammer horrors of old. But his films are a mixed bag and for every great one (MARS ATTACKS, ED WOOD) there are ones that leave me ice cold (CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY, ALICE IN WONDERLAND).My favourite Burton film is SWEENEY TODD, so it may be that I get on better with the ones aimed at adults rather than kids. Sadly, his PLANET OF THE APES remake is aimed purely at kids, and in fact there's no material that ever goes above the intellectual level of your average 4 year old. And if ever there was a film that didn't need remaking, it was PLANET OF THE APES! Everything goes wrong with this picture, and I mean everything. The muddled, dumb-ass script which never goes beyond characters running from A to B, then B to C, and so on for what feels like hours and hours. The ridiculous-looking apes, never menacing for a second and looking more dated now than the ones from the original back in the '60s. Burton's clear disinterest in the material, as evinced by his mundane direction. Wahlberg's embarrassingly wooden performance, or Bonham Carter's embarrassingly mannered one.It's all a great shame, in that it wastes money and the talents of lots of interesting supporting cast members whose skills could have been put towards something more genuine and original. Instead this is one of the worst films I've witnessed in a while, a truly abominable production.
