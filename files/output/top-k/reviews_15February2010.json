Owing to the set design and art direction, you may want to settle down in The Gotham City. However, of course the city is not pleasant always. The gloomy atmosphere, evil Max Shreck who does not know the value of his sweet, sensitive and too polite secretary, instead hates her and The Penguin who tries to ruin Batman's reputation, for example there is a Batmobile sequence, a nightmare for a child. Briefly, Burton gets you stroll in a city that is perilous but also wonderland. Batman is almost in every scene, not Bruce Wayne, Batman. I don't want to compare this with Nolan's movies, but just want to say a few things about both. This is the darkest Batman movie so far by the way. We see daylight very rarely. Batman encounters with Catwoman and Penguin many times and they square accounts with each other which is very important. Remember Two Face character's screen time in The Dark Knight. In the first action scene, we see Batmobile's tricks and want to have it as usual. In Tim Burton's Batman movies, the design of Batmobile is very stylish and appealing, despite my favorite is the one in the original animation series. You know, in Nolan's movies, they made a tank that kills the magic. The attack of the bats? Better planned and better directed than Batman Begins. The camera angles and the chaos in this scene are great. In The Dark Knight, people watched an uninspiring final fight between Batman and Joker and Joker's biggest plans were detonating two ships. In Batman Returns, yes, some people explode some places, but interesting, moreover the film has much more. Michelle Pfeiffer. Tim Burton is interested in details such as the appearances of the characters, their personalities, belongings, costumes and actions. At the beginnings, we see Selina's luminous house. She is a woman who is lonely, neglected, not well-cared for herself and waits for his prince. While observing this character, we don't think that she is a cliché character we have watched a lot of alike ones, may be because of Pfeiffer (and her acting), may be Burton's meticulous player direction, may be both. Moreover, Catwoman is not a typical character, she seems that she is a feminist, but in a scene, she injures a girl after rescuing her. It seems that she hates men, but she shows interest in Batman and also Bruce Wayne. Everyone knows that she was not comfortable in her costume, but remember pain brings victory ) Catwoman looks great in the movie. Danny De Vito with one of the most realistic, so one of the best make-ups ever made. It is impossible to believe that he is Danny De Vito. The scene he eats raw fish, the scene he drives his toy car and the scene he ambushes Catwoman are my favorites. All these things, details are not childish at all, even if they are for some people. Returning to Penguin, he is a cliché villain who hates humanity and whose purpose is destroying the city, killing all the people, but again, Tim Burton does not let us say cliché. With his multifarious weird accessories, weapons and actions, he is a character who is interpreted by Burton in great detail like Catwoman, Joker or Batman himself. Burton is like a detail expert. More than one enemy in a movie. This should not been a problem, but when Sam Raimi failed in Spider-Man 3 according to many people including me, then filmmakers and directors have been started to be afraid of doing that. Tim Burton allows enough time for both of the enemies and this works perfectly. We get to know their personalities, but also we watch them in many action scenes and still there are other characters and other stories like Max Shreck or we witness to Bruce Wayne's life, his relationships or the candidacy of Penguin and the effect he creates.

After this point, noir films (or pseudo-noir, whatever your definition) become either thoroughly modern or openly derivative. The term film noir has itself loosened up to include almost any moody 1940s-style film with crime in it, which starts lose it's descriptive usefulness.But Jack Nicholson is, really, a great detective in the Raymond Chandler mode--sassy, fearless on the surface but actually wary and a little scared in the end, playing by his own set of rules, and working mostly alone. As well made as this movie is in many ways, it's Nicholson's physical presence that makes his scenes really work. He's such a natural actor for the camera, hesitating just long enough to demand attention but not so long it becomes affected, he becomes definitive. And that's enough to make Chinatown classic.The plot, too, is great dramatic stuff. Based in L.A., with lots of night scenes and period interiors, it circles around pretty women and rich men and corrupt politicos and dubious cops. And around water. In a way, this makes the movie prescient, almost--water being no new topic for Los Angeles but increasingly pertinent in the 1970s. Water is also a MacGuffin in the plot, a device we don't care deeply about compared to the interpersonal intrigues, the incest, the murders. All this other stuff keeps the movie, and Nicholson, going, and it's snappy and well done. It isn't exactly brilliant, though, and anyone really looking at the screenplay and following the plot might raise an eyebrow now and then, or question some of the hyperbole around the movie.It's fun seeing director Roman Polanski appear as a jerky, power-hungry kind of thug, because maybe it fits him (though his friends say otherwise). He has confessed to raping of a young teenager long ago, but I have never heard of him actually apologizing for it. (I know that's supposed to stay outside of the analysis of the movie, and he did do 42 days in jail.) Digging further in, you can maybe see John Huston's role as a little strained (though I love Huston in general, and his presence is meant to let us connect to a previous generation of Hollywood) and Faye Dunawaye, for all her fame, is slightly cold at times, a little decorative. The movie has lots of strong effects this way, and you know that Polanski is a movie lover, and the result taken whole is a kind of bowing down to this kind of crime film from earlier on. And in that sense, every doubt I have for the movie above could be countered with a simple, It was intended that way. And the clichés and familiar plot twists are part of an homage to the medium.Which then begs the question--why isn't it filmed with more energy, with less prettiness? It doesn't in fact, adapt to a rigorous, stark, shadowy film noir aesthetic, but instead layers a very well done but slightly 1970s perfect, technically excellent color. Not that it should have been black and white, and not that Farewell My Lovely (filmed the next year in a really vivid, visual, film noir style in color, in L.A.) is the only way to go. But there were options to avoid making it actually too pretty, and too tame.All of this is relative nitpicking. I go back to Nicholson. If you can focus on his role, his lines, his performance, capital P, you will be mesmerized and impressed, again and again. It is a strong movie, and an interesting one, which is a lot.

","genre":"Drama, Mystery, Thriller"},{"date":"15 February 2010","score":"11 out of 18 people found the following review useful","review":" Chinatown (1974)Not so much a film noir in style or character, but a period crime drama, set in the familiar 1930s of many noir films, and featuring a noir fixture, the loner detective.I say this right away because Chinatown is sometimes called the last great film noir. After this point, noir films (or pseudo-noir, whatever your definition) become either thoroughly modern or openly derivative. The term film noir has itself loosened up to include almost any moody 1940s-style film with crime in it, which starts lose it's descriptive usefulness.But Jack Nicholson is, really, a great detective in the Raymond Chandler mode--sassy, fearless on the surface but actually wary and a little scared in the end, playing by his own set of rules, and working mostly alone. As well made as this movie is in many ways, it's Nicholson's physical presence that makes his scenes really work. He's such a natural actor for the camera, hesitating just long enough to demand attention but not so long it becomes affected, he becomes definitive. And that's enough to make Chinatown classic.The plot, too, is great dramatic stuff. Based in L.A., with lots of night scenes and period interiors, it circles around pretty women and rich men and corrupt politicos and dubious cops. And around water. In a way, this makes the movie prescient, almost--water being no new topic for Los Angeles but increasingly pertinent in the 1970s. Water is also a MacGuffin in the plot, a device we don't care deeply about compared to the interpersonal intrigues, the incest, the murders. All this other stuff keeps the movie, and Nicholson, going, and it's snappy and well done. It isn't exactly brilliant, though, and anyone really looking at the screenplay and following the plot might raise an eyebrow now and then, or question some of the hyperbole around the movie.It's fun seeing director Roman Polanski appear as a jerky, power-hungry kind of thug, because maybe it fits him (though his friends say otherwise). He has confessed to raping of a young teenager long ago, but I have never heard of him actually apologizing for it. (I know that's supposed to stay outside of the analysis of the movie, and he did do 42 days in jail.) Digging further in, you can maybe see John Huston's role as a little strained (though I love Huston in general, and his presence is meant to let us connect to a previous generation of Hollywood) and Faye Dunawaye, for all her fame, is slightly cold at times, a little decorative. The movie has lots of strong effects this way, and you know that Polanski is a movie lover, and the result taken whole is a kind of bowing down to this kind of crime film from earlier on. And in that sense, every doubt I have for the movie above could be countered with a simple, It was intended that way.

On the rooftop, two muggers and The Dark Knight. The atmosphere? Misty, dreadful, unsafe and mysterious places that thrill you, the mobsters seesaw between being colorful and being dark etc. However, this is not a shallow or childish adaptation. Yes, may be to compare Burton's Batman movies with Nolan's Batman movies are wrong, but I want to say a few things. Nolan's Batman movies were fundamental reconstructions, but they were very conventional on all counts. Tim Burton's Batman movies are not, those movies are peculiar. By the way, I am one of the people who say that the best Batman was Michael Keaton. Nolan is interested in ideas, Burton is interested in details. If you have seen The Dark Knight, remember Two-Face's screen time for example or Joker character was not highlighted. Tim Burton's characters are interpreted in great detail, with their actions, accessories (my favorite is the dentures), costumes (the best Batman costume is here), personalities etc. Plus the story telling (as said for example, the tone of the movie is very similar with the animation series or comic book) Jack Nicholson deserves all the titles as Joker. A superhuman performance. I would not just say that Jack Nicholson is pretty good as Joker. The scenes he appears are riot of colors, I love this. By the way, Tim Burton shows us the personality of Joker by only one scene, the goodbye talking when he visits Vicki Vale in her house. By the way, in the final, we hear a mysterious and sad sound and the commissioner's face when he finds out. That scene effected me when I watched it for the first time, I was almost a child. After Nicholson, to play Joker would be unthinkable, but Heath Ledger did it that happens once in a blue moon. Watching this new Joker was very amusing, interesting and Heath Ledger's acting was like Daniel Day Lewis style, excellent, but my favorite Joker is always Jack Nicholson. By the way, I don't want to compare Nicholson with Ledger, but want to say that Burton's Joker is much more active than Nolan's Joker. Burton's Joker does many crazy and very interesting things. He kills a mafia boss in a funny and also very sad way, he reshapes hundreds of photos, paints the restaurant (this scene deserves being put in the cinema anthology) Jack Nicholson's Joker is teaser, acute minded, so he leads Batman on a merry chase. Thus, Batman Joker encounter does not become disappointing. You care about what will happen, because you want Joker to be caught, on the other side, may be because of your sympathy for Nicholson or for his Joker character (he has an accident, he losses his magnetism, so you cannot dislike him exactly), you don't want him to be caught or dead. While I was watching the movie for the first time, years years ago, I pleased every time, when Joker dodges Batman. May be it is because you know that if Joker is caught or killed, the movie ends. Action scenes are may be less and mild, but great, so we get that Burton is good at making action scenes too. I love the restaurant scene, the chase scene comes next and the scenes which Batplane arises are great too.

I am someone who loves true story movies, loves old classic movies, and loves movies that build their characters over time.But this movie, in our opinion, lacked plot structure, a point, any sort of climatic instance, any drive, and any real love for the characters.For those of you who plan to see this movie, this is a summary of what we saw. The two main characters are Eric Liddel and Harold Abrahams. They both are honorable characters (honor being the only point of the story) who both love to run and are quite good at it. Both want to be in the Olympics. For most of the movie you hear about how Liddel is a great runner. Every ten minutes you will see him run a race, races which are usually pointless. Between each race scene there is about ten minutes of British banter and young British men running around in their polo shirts and scarves talking about politics and the weather. Throughout the whole movie, you see Abrahams on the sidelines. He hardly ever races. He just sits around flirting with some actress or talking about running.... but not doing any of it. It's apparent that he wants to prove that he's better than Liddel, which gives some tension to the movie. However, they never race aside from the beginning of the movie. The movie ends with him racing without Liddel in the Olympics because Liddel is a Jew and won't run on the Sabbath (honorable and understood). Liddel wins other races without Abrahams.There's nothing I can tell you about these characters other than that the two main characters are honorable men who like to race. Their love interests were hardly seen nor talked about. Abrahams girlfriend just popped up now and then for a kiss and that was about it. There was no point to the love relationships.

It was finally rescued from this and eventually Lynch was offered it, who took up the chance to make a screen adaptation of Frank Herbert's hugely respected 1965 novel.The films plot is deceptively simple In the far future, a duke and his family are sent by the Emperor to the sand world Dune from which comes a spice that is essential for interstellar travel. But there encounter problems with Paul Atreides, who may or may not be a Messiah the natives have been waiting for. Of course it gets much, much more complicated than this and at times it's almost impossible to follow and reading the book beforehand, I'm reliably informed, is a good idea.The music, photography and set design all very impressive, and the special effects are still good (notably the sand worms and the ships that travel through space), if a little dated in some aspects. The acting is variable to say the least. Sting should never have been included and his performance undoubtedly still haunts him, but Kyle MacLachlan as Paul Atreides brings just the right note of ambiguity to his character and his performance is the stand-out one in the whole picture. But I am beating around the bush here David Lynch's direction lends the whole film a real other-worldly feel that is missing in most science-fiction movies. You really do feel like this is the far, far future. He also gives the film moments of true surrealism that are astonishing for a movie that cost $50 million that the backers obviously wanted back (something which never happened on its original release, Dune failed badly) and was intended for a mainstream audience. Unfortunately, despite and perhaps because of, David Lych's visual panache, the movie is nevertheless incoherent towards the last half hour and even at the end, when I had finally got the plot straight in my head, others I wouldn't be surprised to see scratching there heads.This isn't a film classic, it may not even be a minor masterpiece, but it is one of the few movies to convey the feeling of the future so purely, and because of this, good or not, it's a movie you must see at least once in your life. Whatever it is, it's like no other movie you've ever seen.

Visually, there is almost every color, so it is like a funfair. Then, what's the odds? Probably, people don't see Batman and Robin as a parody and it seems that yes, it is not a parody, but an alternative Batman adventure.

It is said that Schwarzenegger is the worst choice for Mr. Freeze and he was ridiculous. Firstly, I am a big Arnold Schwarzenegger fan, so it was a lot of fun to watch him in a Batman movie and as Mr. Freeze who is one of my favorite villains in Batman, but if I had not been a fan of him, still I would have said, Schwarzenegger's Mr. Freeze is not ridiculous. His costume, his weapon look kitsch and childish may be, but interesting and appealing. Yes, like an amusement park. Yes, if you ask me the best choice for Mr. Freeze would be Stanley Tucci and it would be great, if there had been a movie based on him, but I have no problem with this Mr. Freeze. In this movie, some characters are ridiculous, not the actors. For example, Bane character was wasted, but it was entertaining too that is another story. It is said that George Clooney was the worst Batman. I agree with that, because yes, he is inappropriate for this role, Batman. He is the man of the characters who wear suit, not a super hero who wears glaring costumes. Batman in this movie looks like a guy who is in a fancy dress party. As for The Gotham City design, it is kitsch in a good way except for the colossus brownish statue, anti-stylish! The arguments between Batman and Robin and the competition between them for Poison Ivy were unnecessary. Batgirl was an awful idea, it is almost unbearable. And also she causes three heroes for three villains cliché. Lastly, Robin is interested in her which is soap bubble. However, as said, visually, this is one of the most colorful movies so far and in terms of action, Batman and Robin is almost non stop that is like a roller coaster in funfair.

Tommy Lee Jones is one of my all time favorite actors and I like Jim Carrey, but in this movie, they become unbearable, especially Carrey. Lee Jones also recalls Warden Dwight McClusky, he is as mad as him! (in a negative way) The personalities of the villains are perky in contrast with the original characters.

Last year, while searching Batman on the internet, I found a picture that Batman and Robin kiss each other. No comment! And please don't charge me with being homophobic or something.

Batman Forever is one of the most noisy movies ever made like Stephen Sommers movies, I don't say this as a good thing or bad thing, even if sometimes it was overblown to me.

The country is ravaged by the black plague. And on the shore Antonius meets Death, in person. Death tells him his time is due, but Antonius challenges him to a chess game, during which he is permitted to live. He searches for an answer, he wants to know if there is a God, if there is a reason why. The question haunts him. But on his journey home he meets the actors Jof and Mia, and their little son Mikael. They offer him some wild strawberries and for a few moments he find respite and peace, and when Death threatens Jof, Mia and Mikael too, Antonius knows that his chess game is their only chance.Comments A legendary movie from a legendary director. This is a movie that created the stereotype of Death that has inspired, been reused and spoofed countless times. This is a must see movie, one you should have seen at least once in life. So I decided to watch it, despite the fact that my previous impressions of the Bergman movies I've seen have been less than favorable.My impression of this can be summarized in one simple word; dramatic. The story plays out in the frontier between life and death, the dialog is dripping with fate, and the black and white is very black and white, the contrasts being very emphasized. It's on the brink of going over the top but manages somehow to stay on the right side of the line. Antonius Block's mindset of the haunting fear and angst is evident throughout every aspect of the movie.I'm not really sure of how I feel about it. The rating and praise from the critics seem to be too much for me. It's not that good. But it wasn't bad either. It was not very entertaining, but it was interesting.

Consider this the entire film is about being uncomfortable in one's skin. Buffalo Bill, the serial killer at the heart of the picture, has sexual identity issues and hopes to build himself a woman's body. Scorned by the world, Bill kills his victims and strips them of their skin, his aim being to knit himself a body suit so that he may blossom and become a more beautiful person.Likewise, Foster's character, a young FBI agent tasked with finding Buffalo Bill, is constantly placed in positions in which she is chided, belittled and insulted. Taunted for her cheap perfume, her white trash roots, her lowly status, she's constantly being intimidated by men (inmates, police, prison wardens etc), sees her commander as a sexual threat, and seems to have entered the FBI in order to redeem her father, a modest cop shot on duty.Foster's performance throughout the film (at the time, she was known for a slew of androgynous roles) is itself incredibly fragile, masking insecurity and uncertainty behind a facade of toughness. Because her character is so delicate, we the audience become almost protective of her. We watch as she fights her way through a variety of ominous situations and breath a sigh of relief when she eventually emerges victorious, blossoming into the beautiful flower (a promotion to FBI Special Agent) that the deranged Buffalo Bill is denied. Foster may not end the film feeling entirely comfortable in her own skin, but she's proved to herself that she can survive within her body. She can be herself - somewhat - and win.Director Jonathan Demme's follow up film was Philadelphia, a film which revolved around a gay character, so it's possible that Silence's homosexual subtext - if any - was deliberately nudged by him. Regardless, Demme's direction is remarkable throughout the picture. Watch how he milks every scene, every sequence hyped or taken to incredibly dramatic lengths. Foster's visit to Hannibal Lecter (a cannibal who lives in a maximum security prison), for example, takes us down endless flights of stairs, each level heralded by ominous dialogue, a prison warden even pausing to show Foster a photograph of Lecter's mutilated victims. But importantly, while characters in the film flinch in horror at the image on this photograph, the photograph itself is never actually revealed to Demme's audience. This happens throughout the film horrors are talked about, emphasised, hyped, our appetite whetted at every turn, but never actually revealed. Here is a film which respects our imagination and treats the macabre with a certain amount of apprehension. Even the film's ending, in which an escaped Hannibal Lectre walks confidently off into the horizon, is the kind of dramatic tease-climax more common in super hero movies. Whilst most horror movies are a series of carefully set up orgasms, Silence is all anticipation.With the publication of The Murders in the Rue Morgue, horror maestro Edgar Allen Poe became the father of detective fiction. But what's interesting is that with this book we see that crime fiction was born within the horror genre. More specifically, from the very start, the criminal has been (wrongly) treated as a vaguely supernatural being; an incomprehensible, alien and irrational monster.Lambs raked in zillions of dollars, and so kicked off a chain of copycat movies. Post Lambs we thus had such films as Kiss The Girls, Along Came A Spider, Taking Lives, The X Files, Seven, Zodiac, The Cell, The Bone Collector etc etc, all of which copied Lamb's formula, all of which hoped to cash in on its success. The film also spewed the wrong house cliché, the he's in the elevator cliché and numerous others, before the series, with Hannibal and Red Dragon, degenerated into a silly franchise (the same fate befell Jaws, Halloween, Psycho, Alien, Friday the 13th, Elm Street, Poltergeist and The Exorcist). In a way, the fact that these franchises and sequels were even possible, highlights the faintly supernatural roots of such monsters. The vengeful sharks, serial-killers, aliens, demons and slashers come back to haunt their audiences, not because they can never be killed, but because they aren't remotely realistic in the first place (and, of course, because profits necessitate their reappearance).8.5\/10 - Worth multiple viewings.
