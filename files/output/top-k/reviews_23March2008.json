'Galaxy Quest' fits into this category as I made the mistake of watching it while having dinner and I almost choked several times. This is one of the funniest smart comedies I have seen. The film is brilliantly executed and it brilliantly spoofs the science-fiction-spaceship genre. But the film isn't mere silliness as it does have a soul and tells an action adventure story of 5 has-been stars of a famous Star-Trek-type TV show that got cancelled two decades ago. The screenplay is great and the dialogues are witty fun. There is no crude humour or over-the-top-out-of-context joke.The special effects wonderfully add to the spoofiness. The monsters and aliens are a 'treat' to watch. An intelligent comedy isn't easy to make as the maker has to pay close attention to line delivery, characterization, situation, comic timing and direction. 'Galaxy Quests' fulfills all criteria from start to end. Tim Allen as the pompous hero, Alan Rickman as the whiny has-been 'Shakespearean'-actor-forced-to-play-an-android, Tony Shalhoub as the funny Fred, Sam Rockwell as the terrified-of-being-the-first-one-to-die Guy, Enrico Colantoni as the gullible Mathezar and last but not least, the incredibly sexy Sigourney Weaver as the tired-of-playing-dumb-blonde Gwen (the total opposite of her famous Ripley character) play their parts.I'm glad that I bought this film on impulse yesterday as most American spoofs I have seen, like the abysmal Scary Movies (puke) or the silly Screams (yawn) and the ridiculous Naked Guns (okay this last one was kind of funny) hardly have anything more to offer than silliness. Actually I was given the choice between this and 'Naked Gun 33 and a Half' and i'm glad I made the right decision. 'Galaxy Quest' definitely surpasses these films by several miles as I wouldn't even mind calling it one of the best comedies.

However, what is different is that after a one film hiatus, Sean Connery is back--too bad the film, in many ways, sucked. That's because by now, the plots seemed more like comic books and the character of Bond seemed more like self-parody than anything else. While in the past Connery played his character rather straight, here he was playing a smirking and smug guy--as if he was looking at the camera and saying ain't I cute?. In subsequent Roger Moore films, this also, unfortunately was the general pattern.Some of the silliness was still watchable and fun--such as the two gay assassins. They were far from subtle but provided some welcome color to the film. However, Jill St. John, though a gorgeous lady, was too whiny and kooky to be playing a serious character. Nitwit Bond girls are annoying and she was about as bad as Britt Ekland in THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN--yuck.As far as the bad guy goes, Blofeld is back but he seems nothing like the Telly Savalas or Donald Plesence versions. Supposedly he underwent plastic surgery--but could this explain how he was different in EVERY way?! Plus, having Charles Gray play Blofeld was stupid, as he was one of Bond's friends and was killed in YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE.Still, despite many shortcomings, this is a watchable adventure movie--but also, unfortunately, the worst of the original Connery Bond films. A bit less than two decades later, Connery returned to make a new Bond film (NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN), but the less said about this awful film, the better.

It's an explosive, action-packed ride from the glorious opening sequence through the ending, maintaining some level of (surprisingly effective) humor which was mostly included because the script was written, or edited, for Pierce Brosnan, who would only finally take over the role in 1995 for Goldeneye, but largely disposing of the silliness and tackiness of the Moore era, and creating a stealthy, thrilling, effective, and ruthless Bond. Dalton makes a terrific Bond, even competing with Connery for the 'definitive' title as far as movie Bond portrayals go, although Dalton is closer to Fleming's Bond than Connery. After the ultra-suave Roger Moore Bond, Dalton's Bond seems almost mean-spirited in comparison, there may be one-liners, but this guy at least seems fit to be a secret agent.The action scenes in The Living Daylights are all great. I can't think of one which I disliked, and the special effects might be the in the series up to this point. The plot here is actually intriguing, and neither too convoluted or too thin, and keeps you interested from start to finish. The screenplay is terrific, the best in a Bond film since On Her Majesty's Secret Service. Maryam d'Abo makes for a wonderful Bond girl in Kara Milovy, one of the smartest and most likable of all of Bond's 'love' interests. I really like Caroline Bliss' Moneypenny as well. How fresh and exciting this is when compared to the previous entry.I'm honestly hard pressed to find any serious flaws with The Living Daylights. Some have said that it takes itself too seriously, but I never felt that it did. Sure, it was much more straight-faced than most Bond films, but a film is only taking itself too seriously when it becomes thoroughly ridiculous while maintaining a 'serious' superficial look. I never thought that The Living Daylights did this. It, and the follow-up Dalton film License to Kill were both relative financial disappointments, mostly because audiences didn't care for Dalton's hard-edged Bond or the fact that the film had actual characters other than Bond, actual real-world stakes, and no silly villains. Then again, The Living Daylights did extremely well in comparison to most films that year, and it earned much more than A View to a Kill did, so perhaps it is only the lesser Licence to Kill that was a disappointment.How can you go wrong with a movie this well-shot and well-acted, this well-scripted, and so well-scored by John Barry, which would sadly be his last score for the series? A terrific Bond film with a harder edge than most, and one of the few in the series that remains faithful to the spirit of Fleming's novels.

This makes all of them highly watchable if nothing else as they all do have some of those magical, necessary Universal touches some quality actors, able directors, brooding music and great set designs - and, oh yeah, a great monster even if on the decline. Coming in at just 61 minutes, The Mummy's Ghost now follows Kharis and a new high priest going off to New England to fulfill Kharis and Anaka's destiny. The film has good ole George Zucco bequeath his desire and servitude to this quest to a young John Carradine. Zucco's brief role is great and Carradine is pretty good as well. You get all the same Mummy stuff here with the 9 Tana leaves under a moonlit sky, a slow striding, almost catatonic Lon Chaney moving about in a decidedly lumbering fashion, those old-fashioned Universal murder scenes(the one with Frank Reicher particularly effective), and, of course, the ridiculous romance between two actors that cannot act - here the lovely Ramsay Ames and the vacuous Robert Lowery. Throw in Barton MacLane as a tough detective and you have all the makings of not-so-classic Universal fare. This Mummy sequel actually has some originality along plot lines and is much better than at least two of the other sequels. I do have some questions; however. A swamp? Really, a swamp in New England? Huh. There are some others about what Kharis does and Anaka, but suffice it to say they are inexplicable too. Lon Chaney gives a bit more range in his performance in this his second time around as the wrapped one, but he is beginning to become camp here - unintentionally I think. There are several scenes with dogs that best Chaney and they are amusing and pathetic as well, not cutesy as I am sure some may have projected.

It has every element imaginable in it and going for it science fiction, fantasy, humor, action, thrills, family ties (pun intended!), and an assortment of great, oddball characters. Michael J. Fox (in his greatest accomplishment as an actor) is Marty McFly, a 1985 Hill Valley guitar-playing high-schooler who aspires to be a rock 'n roll star. He is the youngest child of working-class parents George and Lorraine McFly (Crispin Glover and Lea Thompson in their best roles). George is working a dead-end job for his mean boss and high-school rival Biff (perfectly cast Thomas F. Wilson). George never realized his dream of being a science-fiction author due to primarily a lack of confidence and Marty doesn't want to follow in his father's footsteps.

And finally, last but not least, Marty has a mentor Dr. Emmett 'Doc' Brown (embodied by the great Christopher Lloyd in a performance that should have won him an Academy Award).Doc is a genius yet oddball scientist (what scientist isn't a little quirky?) builds a time machine composed of a DeLorean (remember that car? the Edsel of the 80s) and then the fun begins. At the town mall one night, Doc and Marty test out his time machine on Doc's dog Einstein and then Marty mistakenly (won't spoil it for those who haven't seen the movie) is transported back to 1955 in the machine and must figure a way to return home. But Marty screws up along the way to finding the young 1955 version of Doc and sets the process in motion that keeps his parents from meeting and falling in love, thereby endangering his very existence. So he and Doc have dual missions to make his parents meet and fall in love and to fix the machine (damaged during the time travel) and get Marty, as Doc would say 'back to the future!' This is my favorite film of director Robert Zemeckis.

It's strange that there really has been no film like this since it came out in 1985. Maybe too difficult to re-create the magic of this one.

The memories I had of So I Married an Axe Murderer allowed me to fill in the blanks and create a seamless experience for when I did look at the TV screen. The script itself is very funny and Mike Myers shows all the potential he had a decade and a half ago. Not to say he didn't live up to it, but I may say he has never matched the brilliance of this, his first big non-SNL character vehicle. Sure he will always be Austin Powers, but to me, I'll never forget his beatnik poetry and crazy Scottish family.Myers plays a commitment-phobe who has finally met the woman he believes could be the one to spend the rest of his life with. Unfortunately, his paranoia&#151;and possibly the truth&#151;leads to the discovery that she may be Mrs. X, a serial husband killer at large. The beauty of the movie, though, is that this aspect isn't the one-joke trick harped on over and over again. Instead we are shown Myers' family, his police officer friend&#151;Anthony LaPaglia&#151;and his relationship with his police captain (Alan Arkin steals every scene), and the ups and down of dating his new love. It all comes back to the murderous intrigue, but by adding all the other comedic elements to complement, we never get bashed over the head, so when that plot point comes back it never feels stale.It is the characters that truly succeed to make this film hold up over time. Myers is fantastic as a normal guy, not needing to be a caricature like he seems to enjoy being of late with all his alter egos. What we get instead is maybe a representation of him, an unassuming guy with a sense of humor to win over any woman he meets. His delivery is priceless throughout and he even shows he can do some stunts in the action rooftop scenes towards the end. It's his turn as the father Stuart that is most memorable. Between the horrible Scottish accent, Coke-bottle eyewear, and crass language, you are laughing before he even gets a chance to speak his lines.The rest of the cast is great too. Nancy Travis is the perfect love-interest, playing the dual-life card with enough mystery so that we never quite know if she is really the killer until the ending; Amanda Plummer is crazy and eccentric as always playing her sister; LaPaglia has the dumb cop down-pat; and the who's who of cameos is great. From Phil Hartman to Steven Wright, to Charles Grodin, everyone does his job. It may not be the best comedy out there, but for some reason, if it's on TV I always find myself glued to the screen needing to watch, or listen as with today, once more, quoting every funny line before it's spoken.

Everywhere I look, I encounter people who could easily be incorporated into a Solondz script.Every storyteller recreates the world according to his\/her own vision. Todd Solondz just happens to be vastly more perceptive and talented than most. Storytelling is one of the most insightful, clever and thought-provoking films I've ever seen.

The original Ian Fleming books generally had nothing to do with the films other than the title and the books also differed in many ways concerning Bond--his style, his personality and mission. Bond was NOT a love 'em and leave 'em guy in the books. Sure, he slept with some women, but he was far less randy and was more of a cold-blooded character. While Bond is too suave and nice in this film, he was closer to the real Bond than any of the subsequent Sean Connery movies. As far as the plot goes, this film was also much closer to the original source material--though Dr. No was NOT operating a nuclear base and his ending was far less exciting in the book (believe it or not, he was crushed to death by a load of guano in the Fleming story).In addition to being more faithful, I also liked this Bond because this is the only time I can remember Bond actually killing someone in cold-blood. In the wonderful bedroom scene, he COULD have let the would-be murderer go, but instead took pleasure in playing with his victim like a cat playing with a mouse. It may just be one of the best Bond scenes ever.Something else that really stood out for the better in this film was Jack Lord as the first of many Felix Leiters. Oddly, in each film, a different guy played this CIA man. I don't know why they didn't try to keep a consistent actor for the role, but I bet they didn't use Lord again because I am sure many ladies in the audience thought he was better looking than Connery--something that might distract from his movie image. If you don't believe me, look at the later Leiters--all rather homely or non-distinctive. Oddly, one, from THUNDERBALL, looked a bit like Danno from Hawaii 5-0--but he was given so little screen time that there wasn't a chance to steal any of Connery's glory.All in all, there was very little not to like in this action-packed but more believable Bond film. Sure, it was different from the book, but this is one case where I think this actually wasn't a problem--the way the book ended was pretty anticlimactic. See this and you've seen the best Sean Connery Bond film, as it's intelligently written and rather free of the usual silly gadgetry.

I was engrossed for the first thirty minutes, until I realised how little interest I held in the characters. Yes, Jack Nicholson's Jack Torrance is amazing, and his descent into madness is one of the most interesting parts of the film, but... How could anyone sympathize with him? Or Danny? Or Wendy? In the novel, you understand what motivates each of these characters. In the film, you're just expected to accept them doing what they do as they do it. I can give Kubrick that he didn't have a whole lot of time for characterization if he wanted to add in all he did, but I'd have liked to see more, which is rare for me after watching a two and one-half hour movie. One thing the film gets completely right is the mood along with the characters, you actually feel trapped within the Overlook. Even the establishing shots of the road leading up to the hotel are foreboding, despite how amazingly beautiful they are. Each of Jack's hallucinations (if you can call them that) are startling and, for lack of a better word, trippy. His slow descent into insanity is enthralling. Tony's appearances, though considerably disappointing when put next to the novel's version, are also horrifying. However, as I said before, the problem is characterization. I could have cared less for anyone on the screen, whether they lived or died.

This becomes obvious about 1\/3 thru the film. Christopher Walken is the Main Attraction here make no mistake about that. God he was a perfect choice and I mean perfect.

Penn has a crew that couldn't even complete high school. Dim bulbs is the term I would use. Walken's men are the suburban versions of Scorsese's Goodfellas. They don't look like thieves, they look like killers who are also professional thieves. At Close Range starts off looking like your basic crime film and then escalates to Walken and his gang committing acts of unspeakable evil that some criminals wouldn't even contemplate. All of these guys were bad bad bad people and whom no one would be sorry to see go to prison for the rest of their lives. Why Walken has not given an Academy Award nomination for this I am still trying to reason out. Perhaps because he was given one for the Deer Hunter I suppose but still one was in order. When you see Walken's face come out of the dark of night into his house's screen door and see Penn, he doesn't show shock. He doesn't show fear. He doesn't even blink. That is the mark of a true master criminal and\/or psychotic. He gives him no emotion whatsoever then slowly the Cheshire Cat smile and invites him right in. You can't buy that kind of sinister inhumanity. You have to be born with it or learn it for yourself. And what Big Brad Whitewood did defies belief.

Penn has a crew that couldn't even complete high school. Dim bulbs is the term I would use. Walken's men are the suburban versions of Scorsese's Goodfellas. They don't look like thieves, they look like killers who are also professional thieves. At Close Range starts off looking like your basic crime film and then escalates to Walken and his gang committing acts of unspeakable evil that some criminals wouldn't even contemplate. All of these guys were bad bad bad people and whom no one would be sorry to see go to prison for the rest of their lives. Why Walken has not given an Academy Award nomination for this I am still trying to reason out. Perhaps because he was given one for the Deer Hunter I suppose but still one was in order. When you see Walken's face come out of the dark of night into his house's screen door and see Penn, he doesn't show shock. He doesn't show fear. He doesn't even blink. That is the mark of a true master criminal and\/or psychotic. He gives him no emotion whatsoever then slowly the Cheshire Cat smile and invites him right in. You can't buy that kind of sinister inhumanity. You have to be born with it or learn it for yourself. And what Big Brad Whitewood did defies belief. Certainly without question one of the best films of 1986.

Almost too wicked to be true yet true it is. Sean Penn is electric in At Close Range. Penn plays the role with the attitude of a 16 year old, who thinks he's smarter than his dad. He isn't. This becomes obvious about 1\/3 thru the film. Christopher Walken is the Main Attraction here make no mistake about that. God he was a perfect choice and I mean perfect.

Few reviewers here indicate that they have read the novel. Not surprising. I myself have seen many novel-based films without reading the original. What surprises me is that no reviwer has noted that the novel involves NO murder whatsoever. This is hardly a spoiler, since the murder is revealed in the opening scene of the movie.By the late thirties, Cain had graduated from crime stories to more ambitious novels about gay opera singers (Serenade) and frumpy housewives striving to transcend failed marriages and hobbled by ungrateful offspring (MP). Like Mildred herself, Cain's reach exceeded his grasp. And like Hammett and Chandler, he never again equaled his early work.Mildred Pierce is an interesting novel--almost a satire of middle class California strivers--but not one obviously suited to the cinema. It would have taken Orson Welles at his Ambersons height to make a faithful and compelling adaptation of Mildred Pierce as written by Cain.Credit producer Jerry Wald with understanding that movie-goers expected a murder in a Cain story and would leave the theater disappointed if the film proved to be only a well-crafted melodrama. Wald and screenwriter Ranald MacDougal brilliantly created a cinematic Oreo that sandwiches a squishy center that roughly follows the novel between two crisp, dark cookies of violence and betrayal. This gave the movie the dark sensibility that the audience had come to expect from a Cain film.As others have noted, Mildred is far more noble in the film than in the book. In the latter, she is, business success notwithstanding, the frumpy mediocrity that Veda judges her to be. To his credit, Cain is brutal to Mildred (and to every other character) on this score. In the end, this diminishes the impact of her downfall on the reader. The novel remains interesting mostly as a commentary on depression-era California, a promised land without the promise.The movie is in many ways better than the novel. It moves more fluidly and has an effective payoff that the novel lacks. Crawford, Blyth, Arden and Carson are all excellent in their roles, with special kudos to the latter two. It is true that the male leads, Scott and Bennett, are fairly wooden, but so are their characters in the novel itself. It is hard to see how either could pique, much less hold, the interest of a Mildred as dynamic as Crawford's. A flaw to be sure, but not fatal.In the end, Mildred Pierce works better as a film than as a novel, in no small part because it is less ambitious. By abandoning the larger undercurrents of the novel, the film is free to exploit the simple cinematic elements that make it so effective.

It's unfortunate that such a brilliant comic pairing couldn't have been made on Beckinsale's side. Her best friend is quite dim and provides nothing for the film except flimsy plot points.It's a standard romantic comedy. I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because...I don't know. Perhaps because there were too many opportunities for ratcheting up the intensity or interest that went by the wayside. Perhaps because I wanted to sleep during several scenes. Regardless, it's utterly forgettable entertainment that certainly won't go down in any enduring best of compilations.
