It's actually probably more difficult to make a realistic fictional film than to translate a tragic, but true, event to film. Mo Ogrodnik experiences this problem with his first fictional film, 1996's Ripe.Based on an apparently true story of two fourteen year old girls who survive a car crash which kills their parents, Ripe is ostensibly about the bond between sisters and their different ways of dealing with the onset of adolescence. Both physically mature, the two girls run away from the accident and find residence at a military base, where they find a home with a long-haired biker. Out of tragedy comes further tragedy.As evidenced by the film's poster (featuring Monica Keena's nymphet Violet biting into an apple), Ogrodnik,  who got his start making documentaries, seems to think he has a provocative story of innocence lost and a fall from grace. The problem is that what he really has is a connection of completely unmotivated actions featuring a string of characters who are completely without depth. Keena's Violet is becoming interested in sex. Daisy Eagen's Rose is becoming interested in Violence. And Peter, the man who takes them in, is basically just there. He has no past and no dialogue to give any sense at all of who he is.I guess the film has a nice look. Wolfgang Held's cinematography calls to mind the empty spaces and spare setting of Badlands, a slightly similar kinda-true story of innocence and violence. But the style is to service of nothing. The plot can't move because everything that happens either seems unbearably tacky (every scene involving the soldiers at the base is like a bad copy of every basic training movie ever made, from Biloxi Blues to Full Metal Jacket). Keena (whose recurring role on Dawson's Creek marks the only time you would have ever seen any member of the cast) and Eagan give decent performances, but it's tough to get involved with the characters' internal lives because of the paucity of closeups. As Peter,  Gordon Currie is fairly awful. He's given nothing to do and yet he still comes of only as shrill. He seems neither sympathetic, nor creepy and probably the film would like him to be one or the other. Basically he's a cypher.Ripe is only marginally provocative and it produces no real emotion. As studies of young sexuality it's inferior to the underrated Adrian Lynne Lolita. And as a story of young girls made old before their time it pales in comparison to Manny and Lo.I guess I'd probably give it a 3.5 outta 10 because I've certainly seen worse films, but I sure can't think of much to recommend it.

Even the music adds to the frenetic pace of the film.The documentary follows the 1992 Clinton Campaign from the doldrums in New Hampshire, through the Democratic convention in New York to its summit on election night in Little Rock.  But Clinton spends very little time on the screen.  The film captures the behind-the-scenes action of James Carville, George Stephanopolis, and the rest of the cast and crew of Clinton campaign headquarters.  The film shows how TV spots are written, how interviews are managed, how the candidates' message is distributed, and how the spin doctors do their stuff.The pace is quick. Staffers come into and out of scenes constantly, and there is a great deal of off-camera dialogue, much like an emergency-room scene from E.R. The mix of standard documentary footage with news reports and interviews is terrific.  Some of the best scenes are of the pols watching the news reports and reacting to what they see.The central character is James Carville, who is more interesting than anyone else in the campaign, much moreso than the candidates themselves.  He reveals that his Ragin' Cajun image is genuine, for he is truly passionate about his work.  But it also reveals a mind working on overdrive, and a sensitive nature that you wouldn't expect to see.

He also had a moment at the end of the film when, in a room with a starry-eyed female staffer, he's describing how he feels.  And the conclusion is, not much. It is not hard to understand why years later George was a washout in the Clinton White House, never managed another campaign, and is now earning his living in front of the camera.After all is said and done, it is clear that the candidate is secondary in a modern presidential election.  He's like the hand your dealt in a game of poker.  It's important, but what you do with it once it is dealt to you is much more important.  And these guys are pros.So are the filmmakers.

(This also happened for me in Boogie Nights.)I was reminded of Charles Bronson in his prime. The same physical presence and brooding depths.

But I have heard this film described as 'poetry' by others, and that is probably the best way way to describe it.I discovered this movie when I came home late one night in the late 80's and, channel-surfing, ran into a scene that took place on a porch of a house in the middle of a sweeping field of grain. This visual, combined with beautiful, haunting music, prevented me from clicking to the next channel.I recently figured out why I love this movie as a whole. I've always known what I loved about its 'parts' the majestic images of the American prairie, the Leo Kottke and Ennio Morricone music, the beautiful, haunting feeling the film delivers. But I could never quite put my finger on what I liked about it overall until recently.It's the simplicity. Many people fault this movie with being short on plot and dialog, but you should not judge this movie for what it is not, but what it is a masterful essay in simplicity. The simple plot and spartan dialogue was deliberate to convey the sense of simple living that was at conflict with the growing industrialization and changing values at the turn of the century. I think excess dialogue or heavier narrative would have ruined the movie.Maybe its just because I grew up in the country and am a sucker for visual\/aural experiences that romanticize the American plains, but this is in my top 10 favorites.

How could anyone create such filth?(I got all this from the previews).  But I was stunned when I caught this film on television one day, because I liked it in all respects.  There have only been a couple of movies that I have judged so harshly without seeing them and was enthralled by them and Drop Dead Fred was one of them.  This movie was hilarious but it was more then just that.  A lot of people did not understand this movie because they were searching in the shallow waters and never dove deep into the meaning of it.  Fred may or may not be a figment of Phoebe Cates imagination, that is left for the viewer to decide.  He was obnoxious, he was mean and selfish, but was their any other way to portray him?  Cute and cuddly maybe?  Sweet and likeable?  Now that would have annoyed me.  Fred was a troublemaker, he was the wild, uncontrollable child in Phoebe Cates.  He represented the ounce of child left in her. This movie was made to show that adults abandon the child within to live a bore of a life.  This adult was portrayed in Cate's mother to contrast with her character.  People who deny their inner child can never live an entirely fulfilling life.  Rick Mayall did an incredible job as Drop Dead Fred.  Without him, the movie would not have survived.  But everyone else in the movie did a great job too.  This movie is very enjoyable-watch it with an open mind.
