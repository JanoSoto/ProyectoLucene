But to call it the greatest movie ever made seems rather arbitrary when you compare it to a long line of equally inventive and well put together stories that have come since (not to mention more entertaining). The only reason I can imagine that it has risen to this level of acclaim is that so many people have called it the best that it makes anyone who disagrees look like they just don't get it. So, Citizen Kane longs for the simplicity of his childhood, when happiness was so easily attained. If Kane could whisper to us he would say that what he wants is unconditional love, from someone who has nothing to gain. What he has been seeking is the love of his mother, who at the first opportunity abandons him, perhaps because of his rambunctious nature. He would tell us that when you only seek your own happiness you are incapable of love. I say I get it but it just isn't as clever as you'd like to believe it is. Agreeing that this is the greatest movie ever is like agreeing that the Citroen DS is the most attractive car ever. Everyone knows that it really isn't, but they humor it because it makes them look deep. I believe that movies serve a specific purpose, and if they fail to achieve this purpose they have failed, period. The way I measure the quality of a movie, is by its ability to do what a movie is supposed to. Fiction exists as a mirror, to reflect back at us the fundamental truths of the human experience. A good movie should be one that takes us to a place of emotional enlightenment. It scratches that part of the human psyche that only the most moving moments of life can accomplish; moments of sadness, joy, anticipation, excitement etc. But surely if a movie fails to move you it fails. I cannot imagine how this movie could have possibly floored anyone. I can recall many movies that have left me a lot more moved American Beauty, Godfather II, The Shawshank Redemption, Requiem for a Dream, Fight Club, Forrest Gump, and Saving Private Ryan to name a few. Lastly I'll say this, Shakespeare was great for among many things being able to write a play that was commissioned by the Queen of England, but that was equally enjoyed by both peasants and nobles. That takes talent. Wrapping up your oh so clever point in an enigma is something that I believe many authors do in order to make themselves look clever.

And shock of shocks, it wasn't until today (of Christmas Eve of all times, ho-ho-ho) that I finally sat down and watched it- it wasn't a 'family staple' in my house- but I knew I had to watch it, if only to see James Stewart in the seminal role of George Bailey. It is, no doubt, with enough fantastical scenes to make up a couple more movies, and the heart that sits right in It's a Wonderful Life beats with all the vigor and pride of the most schmaltzy- and rightly proud of it- American spirit. That I ended up not finding it to be a truly astonishing movie may be that I'm just a cynic deep down, or that maybe this kind of story, and how it plays out, has ended up being done so many times I practically knew what the story was before going in. It's the most amazing of credits to Capra and his cast and crew that it does hold up this well, and that the sentimentality stringing together much of what happens is actually well earned. But it does teeter on becoming a bit too dated, or rather that it's appeal of being a fable really only works best when dealing with the crux of the character George Bailey, and almost becomes weird in how it leaps from great happiness to the terrible bleakness of modern American life.Indeed, Stewart was not only the best choice for George Bailey, but the correct one, the kind we'd probably all like to have in our town as the man who despite his better senses commits his life to being there for the ones he cares for. It almost becomes a running gag, however not really funny as much as touching, the way he puts aside his own feelings and self-wants to help save the bank and Bedford Falls from the peril that could come from the dastardly Potter (Lionel Barrymore, cast perfectly for the role as well with his sinister eyebrows and cunning attitude). I first thought it would be all about George seeing life as if he had never been born, but really this is(wisely) kept to the last twenty minutes of the picture. This works because we see how Bailey gets to that point of almost jumping off into the river, which in its selfish way would be, to him, still a selfless act (i.e. worth more than dead). Seeing George's life is like peering into one of those tall-tale American stories where the little guy gets a lot done by just being himself- or at least his better self getting the better of him. All George wants to do as a young man is explore the world, make great buildings and things. But any lofty ambition becomes squashed by reality- of his father's death, of the very sneaky attitude imposed by Potter, and by the townspeople practically needing some hope during the depression. So it's up to him to not only save the town by making a section of the town named after him for low-cost housing, but to marry a girl Mary (Donna Reed) who's fallen totally for George.What ends up being most memorable, for me, about It's a Wonderful Life is the skill which Capra makes possibly one-dimensional figures very real and immediate, and that in this seemingly simplistic world of right and wrong and good and bad there are the slivers of gray that work their way in. I loved one scene in particular where Potter, desperate to gain back control over his possible monopoly in Bedford Falls, tries to will George away to work for him at far more an amount of money he would make on his own terms with his small bank. It's a tense scene in how devilish Potter comes off, and how Barrymore turns on the ideal of greed and necessity and the ego of a man over the higher principles that George ultimately goes for. It's always fascinating too to see how Stewart plays certain scenes and lines and inflections, moments of surprise and delight which probably hide just the bits of bitterness that build up in him. There's something about the American dream that is called into question in American life, even as Capra likes to jump from sweet touches of light comedy to stark tragedy or danger. There's a great juxtaposition that is made too with the characters of Harry Bailey, George's brother, who goes on to lead the life George might have led had he not saved Harry as a boy, and as well in a small part with Sam Wainwright.It's through the sort of realistic groundings then that Capra is able to get away with reaching for the fantasy structure that ends up coming out of the film, the typical 'what if' nightmare scenario that has ended up influencing countless movies and TV shows. Like Christmas Carol, though sort of in reverse, it's sort of meant as a lesson in humanity, and how what is carried in a man or what is lacking in it ends up bringing it out or losing it in others. It all builds to help Capra earn the melodrama and ultra-heightened emotions brought out with Clarence the angel. It doesn't mean that, at least for me, there aren't things that end up being dated (however, scenes like the dance-hall bit in 1928, is timeless in its humor), mainly in how the idealism and old-fashioned ways come out in this day & age. But still, it doesn't stop me from saying that It's a Wonderful Life is a must see, if only once, and there's no doubt why it's been revered as one of the great films about the triumph of the human spirit.

But it does teeter on becoming a bit too dated, or rather that it's appeal of being a fable really only works best when dealing with the crux of the character George Bailey, and almost becomes weird in how it leaps from great happiness to the terrible bleakness of modern American life.Indeed, Stewart was not only the best choice for George Bailey, but the correct one, the kind we'd probably all like to have in our town as the man who despite his better senses commits his life to being there for the ones he cares for. It almost becomes a running gag, however not really funny as much as touching, the way he puts aside his own feelings and self-wants to help save the bank and Bedford Falls from the peril that could come from the dastardly Potter (Lionel Barrymore, cast perfectly for the role as well with his sinister eyebrows and cunning attitude). I first thought it would be all about George seeing life as if he had never been born, but really this is(wisely) kept to the last twenty minutes of the picture. This works because we see how Bailey gets to that point of almost jumping off into the river, which in its selfish way would be, to him, still a selfless act (i.e. worth more than dead). Seeing George's life is like peering into one of those tall-tale American stories where the little guy gets a lot done by just being himself- or at least his better self getting the better of him. All George wants to do as a young man is explore the world, make great buildings and things. But any lofty ambition becomes squashed by reality- of his father's death, of the very sneaky attitude imposed by Potter, and by the townspeople practically needing some hope during the depression. So it's up to him to not only save the town by making a section of the town named after him for low-cost housing, but to marry a girl Mary (Donna Reed) who's fallen totally for George.What ends up being most memorable, for me, about It's a Wonderful Life is the skill which Capra makes possibly one-dimensional figures very real and immediate, and that in this seemingly simplistic world of right and wrong and good and bad there are the slivers of gray that work their way in. I loved one scene in particular where Potter, desperate to gain back control over his possible monopoly in Bedford Falls, tries to will George away to work for him at far more an amount of money he would make on his own terms with his small bank. It's a tense scene in how devilish Potter comes off, and how Barrymore turns on the ideal of greed and necessity and the ego of a man over the higher principles that George ultimately goes for. It's always fascinating too to see how Stewart plays certain scenes and lines and inflections, moments of surprise and delight which probably hide just the bits of bitterness that build up in him. There's something about the American dream that is called into question in American life, even as Capra likes to jump from sweet touches of light comedy to stark tragedy or danger. There's a great juxtaposition that is made too with the characters of Harry Bailey, George's brother, who goes on to lead the life George might have led had he not saved Harry as a boy, and as well in a small part with Sam Wainwright.It's through the sort of realistic groundings then that Capra is able to get away with reaching for the fantasy structure that ends up coming out of the film, the typical 'what if' nightmare scenario that has ended up influencing countless movies and TV shows. Like Christmas Carol, though sort of in reverse, it's sort of meant as a lesson in humanity, and how what is carried in a man or what is lacking in it ends up bringing it out or losing it in others. It all builds to help Capra earn the melodrama and ultra-heightened emotions brought out with Clarence the angel. It doesn't mean that, at least for me, there aren't things that end up being dated (however, scenes like the dance-hall bit in 1928, is timeless in its humor), mainly in how the idealism and old-fashioned ways come out in this day & age. But still, it doesn't stop me from saying that It's a Wonderful Life is a must see, if only once, and there's no doubt why it's been revered as one of the great films about the triumph of the human spirit.

And shock of shocks, it wasn't until today (of Christmas Eve of all times, ho-ho-ho) that I finally sat down and watched it- it wasn't a 'family staple' in my house- but I knew I had to watch it, if only to see James Stewart in the seminal role of George Bailey. It is, no doubt, with enough fantastical scenes to make up a couple more movies, and the heart that sits right in It's a Wonderful Life beats with all the vigor and pride of the most schmaltzy- and rightly proud of it- American spirit.

The wicked magician is being chased by a cyclops, but is rescued by Sinbad and his men, who help him to safety aboard their vessel.

I never got into his shorts, because I was forever caught in the glare of the unworthy mentions such as It and Thinner, amongst other total page flopper's.However, the cast and crew of the turning-of-age film Stand By Me must have been just caught in the time-period and all of it's everlasting glory. It's hard to believe that this movie was made in the depths of the 1980's, when throw-back moments may have been high, but more high on cocaine than on the plateau of self-awareness as portrayed in this milestone of modern film-making.You could cry at this movie, and with it, but never figure out why. Thirty laughs practiced for young Corey Feldman, and you wonder why. You'll wonder why, and you'll never figure out who it is that River Phoenix character will remind you of from your own life. But you'll pine out of the miseries that you've experienced, for at least two solid hours, those moments you've left in the distant past, yet so close to your heart.A strange thing, even the young actors of the piece seem to be left-overs from a better, more innocent, and golden era when rock and roll was skittish, time moved so slow it appeared to whiz by at the bat of an eye. You can almost see the horseflies try to land on the camera lens, and in some of the more poignant parts of the film, you almost wish you could see the director's wastebasket filled with Kleenex.Sure, it's an oldie but goo-die, but when the oldies are blaring from your television speakers, no DVD does it better for the amount of nostalgia offered here. I've seen this movie about 20 times, and it simply doesn't get old enough, to make it any easier to stand by and watch the children that we wish we knew and had as friends, wander through life whimsically yet in an education of the mind body and soul. Your heart may thump through their escapades along the train tracks of life, but you won't forget for a second that this is when and where life should have stayed.Guns, cigarettes, booze, dead people, life-threatening situations and suspense, and yet all we are doing is watching a future journalist sling around with his cheerful crew of buddies.

I just didn't think she was fit for this role. I'm sure that if I watched the movie before reading the book, my opinion would've been totally different. After all, Sydney Pollack is a darn good director who knows his stuff when it comes to this genre. I know that adapting a novel for the screen is a rough process (10 times more difficult than writing an original screenplay), but the screenwriters could've done a more earnest job at making a suspenseful film, while at the same time remaining faithful to the Grisham novel. I don't care if this movie was 3 hours and 30 minutes long. I'd rather watch that than such a condensed version of this great story.

At least for me, he succeeds in doing this almost magical thing with every single one of his films, from She's Gotta Have It to Inside Man. Even with the films of his that aren't very good, like Girl 6 and She Hate Me, I'm still completely enthralled in the story. Crooklyn has a story with no main focus. Its characters just exist, and life just happens to them, sometimes nudging them like a begging dog and sometimes splashing in their faces like a bucket of soap.

There is really no need for this scene at all. Why kill the dog? Like it's some joke to get back on the woman for being annoying? However, miraculously, as it's very hard for me to forgive a movie when an inexplicable animal death or scene or cruelty towards any animal occurs, I still love this film. The single bias I have that can nearly always ruin a movie for me otherwise is hesitantly but irresistibly dismissed.

I first saw King Kong about the age of nine or ten, and was completely enthralled by its gripping story telling ,and hair raising adventure. Kong himself is truly a character, not just a special effect.

When I read about the painstaking work of Willis O'Brien and his crew, the months of patient labor, that often yielded only a few feet of film a day, I was awed and amazed by the true labor of love that the movie was for its creators.The thing that has always fascinated me about King Kong is that it is unmistakably a product of the times when it was made, the great Depression of the Thirties. Just the scene of Carl Denham searching through breadlines and charity missions to find a woman to play his leading lady ,tells much about the grim real life background of the fantastic story. I don't think it would have been the same film if made at any time before or after 1933.And yet, Kong's eternal appeal is the basic story, which transcends the passage of years. The Beauty and the Beast theme will never cease to intrigue and move audiences, and Kong himself will remain, for all his brutality and ferocity, a tragic character, whose lonely death can still bring forth tears from any audience.

As they pull up to the cabin where they will be staying they notice that a group of teens are staying in another cabin nearby. Tina is not convinced that this is the right approach to help her & in a rage storms out & runs down by a nearby lake.

Now here's the problem, it's obvious that the censors got their scissors out again & Friday the 13th Part VII The New Blood has to be the tamest & most bloodless in the entire series, every kill looks cut, every kill is more-or-less bloodless & there's just no graphic gore or violence whatsoever, come on guys what are we watching films like this for anyway? In the end I found it all rather dull with little in the way of build up to the kills & absolutely no pay-off or reward for sticking with it.

I was not disappointed.The humor seem to have grew throughout the film. The power of this comedy is its entire 'staying power', and with only a few exceptions it builds at the beginning and never lets up. Brilliantly done spoof that manages to strike the perfect tone of balance throughout by the characters ever outrageous pokes at stereotypes of all kinds, the sexuality of black men, especially with white women, is laughed at in all kinds of ridiculous and over the top angles, mixing in the token look of Uncle Tom in a white mans business world to the alter ego of Eddie Griffin, the title character of the movie. Dave Chappelle is fantastic, continually spoofing the angry black man with a conspiracy problem and a weed problem, never quite in on whats the subject but always funny.Billie Dee Williams character was great too and a unforgiving and harsh jab at Ret. Gen. Colin Powell, a military man who held real credentials until his one blemish, going to the UN with news he probably didn't believe (note my opinion) I also do not know if a feeling of resentment by the black community was real or, like much of this film, just imagined and spoofed in this comparison of these two, as 'Gen. Boutwell' turns into a 'down on the farm' character in black face, dancing at the behest of the white world for profit and inclusion in the all white club.

They forget this.This is a witty, sharply written drama, the antithesis of socialism to answer others here, about the triumph of good over evil, of conservative stability and justice over corruption. The entire town, the whole world, has more soul, is better off, with George around to help counter gross misunderstanding and greedy manipulations of the 'the system'.Potter doesn't believe in people. He doesn't ultimately believe his own rhetoric. But George shares his father's belief that people can better themselves, through hard work, diligence, but with the corruption of 'Potter's rules' removed as a barrier. George represents the American Dream, as always understood. Potter is the oppressive evil that imagines itself to be 'more equal' than everyone else, whether represented as the self-satisfied oligarch or the 'Barbary Coast' decadence of Potterville, with its 'workers slums'. George represents the spirit of self-sacrifice, putting his own dreams aside so that others might thrive, so that 'the system' works for people, and not against them. It's the will of the middle class aspiring not just to home additions, and third cars, but to long-lasting, just and peaceful stability and appreciation of others, shown in so many ways.But there is bitterness. George does the right thing, but still bears a burden. And when his 'silly Billy' literally hands Potter the bank's cash, George is furious and begins to forget that he is loved and admired for putting his faith in others. The irony is that he succumbs to a host of misunderstandings, himself, which is precisely what his role in the community has tended to cure when it comes to others. At his lowest, he loses faith in them by losing faith in himself. And in that confusion, enter the angel.Here's the twist on Dicken's A Christmas Carol. And the angel shows how people suffer, not because of a man's life, Scrooge, but if that man never lived, George Bailey. Without the need to retell A Christmas Carol in that way, they could have cut immediately to the party at the house, and the cash, all the credit, but no angel would have 'gotten its wings'.The Christmas Carol angle is there not just so that George sees that he is loved but so that we see the same in our friends and relatives. The lesson is that even in little things, like the boring life of running some small town savings and loan (cause they still had those), not only might he be better off, but so is everyone who has benefited from being associated with him.It's no coincidence that such a film, and such a message, is associated with Christmastime.

George represents the spirit of self-sacrifice, putting his own dreams aside so that others might thrive, so that 'the system' works for people, and not against them. It's the will of the middle class aspiring not just to home additions, and third cars, but to long-lasting, just and peaceful stability and appreciation of others, shown in so many ways.But there is bitterness. George does the right thing, but still bears a burden. And when his 'silly Billy' literally hands Potter the bank's cash, George is furious and begins to forget that he is loved and admired for putting his faith in others. The irony is that he succumbs to a host of misunderstandings, himself, which is precisely what his role in the community has tended to cure when it comes to others. At his lowest, he loses faith in them by losing faith in himself. And in that confusion, enter the angel.Here's the twist on Dicken's A Christmas Carol. And the angel shows how people suffer, not because of a man's life, Scrooge, but if that man never lived, George Bailey. Without the need to retell A Christmas Carol in that way, they could have cut immediately to the party at the house, and the cash, all the credit, but no angel would have 'gotten its wings'.The Christmas Carol angle is there not just so that George sees that he is loved but so that we see the same in our friends and relatives. The lesson is that even in little things, like the boring life of running some small town savings and loan (cause they still had those), not only might he be better off, but so is everyone who has benefited from being associated with him.It's no coincidence that such a film, and such a message, is associated with Christmastime.

They forget this.This is a witty, sharply written drama, the antithesis of socialism to answer others here, about the triumph of good over evil, of conservative stability and justice over corruption. The entire town, the whole world, has more soul, is better off, with George around to help counter gross misunderstanding and greedy manipulations of the 'the system'.Potter doesn't believe in people. He doesn't ultimately believe his own rhetoric. But George shares his father's belief that people can better themselves, through hard work, diligence, but with the corruption of 'Potter's rules' removed as a barrier.
