Seems to me that we actually CAN believe in this scenario, where human beings are only some slaves and no matter what we do we can not emerge from this state of facts... But, after all, what we are, if we are not the graters believers. We believe in everything media tells us is true, we believe in all that religion tells us is true, we believe in anything... Sad is that, we forget to believe in ourselves, and, this is the point where Matrix come and re-teach us to believe. In fact, the whole story speaks to our ego and transmit a message in the end, all that matters is to believe IN YOURSELF!!! Enjoy this magnificent movie!
