Don't get me wrong, I hate bad actors, and if you've read my other reviews, you'll see that I talk a lot about crappy actors.  But those are for movies where good acting is required for the situation to be believable. 'Armageddon' is a movie that does not require good acting.  Michael Bay never said that the movie would have Academy Award winning acting in the movie.  He said it would be an action packed thrill ride.And it was.  The movie was very good, because it kept the action going straight to the end.  It didn't matter if the acting sucked.  But I have to be accurate about this movie  The acting was half-decent.  I mean, whenever I see bad acting, I almost always laugh.  I never once laughed during this movie, except when the script required me to.  The acting is pretty good. Bruce Willis is not my favourite actor, after all, some of his movies have shown his 'bad actor' side.  But he does a decent job in this movie along with the rest of the cast.And finally, I will say this.  The last 10 minutes of the movie disturb me. They are horrifyingly sad!!  The last 10 minutes of 'Titanic', were nothing compared to this.  I swear, I almost cried!!  It was so depressing, I was tight-lipped for the first few minutes after I left the theatre.  That's amazing.  A movie starring Bruce Willis is sadder than 'Titanic'.Although I should tell you  I'm speaking hypothetically.  I didn't find 'Titanic' sad.  In fact I laughed!  But I know many people cried their eyes out in that movie.  So if I didn't find 'Titanic' sad, and millions of other people did, and then I found 'Armageddon' sad, what does that tell you? That 'Armageddon' is one hell of a sad movie.So if you're one of those 'Go see an action flick, just 'cause it's an action flick' kind of guys, go see this movie.  If you enjoy good acting, decent story and stuff like that, go see this movie.  If you want to cry your eyes out at the end, go see this movie.

But this movie has all of those things.  So why did I enjoy it so much?  Because the director Michael Bay managed to take all those elements that make up an action movie and polish them to a gleaming shine.When I watch this movie, I get a sense of excitement that is rarely found in movies today.  There are lots of movies out there with just as much, if not more action than 'The Rock'.  But for some reason, 'The Rock' is by far more exciting and entertaining than all those other action flicks.  And the villain is great.  He's bad but not too bad.  I hate it when I see a villain who so evil, that you almost know what his next move is going to be.  If you know what he's gonna do, where's the suspense?I also like Sean Connery and Nicholas Cage as a team.  They make an interesting combo.  We have a nerd who specializes in chemicals who is a major wuss and then in the end is a hero, and then we have a hardass who is also a genius who gets a little soft by the end.  They could fight crime!!It also has its funny moments.  Every movie needs a funny moment.  If it doesn't, the movie will get boring, because there is no break from the violence and action.  A movie sometimes needs a little humor to break the ice.In the end, this movie is near the top of my list.  It has a serious plotline and is very exciting during the action scenes, but is also a lot of fun when things calm down.  It's one of my favourites.  We'll probably never see a movie with as much excitement ever again.  Oh well.  Looks like it's back to old family vacation videos.

As the film goes on, you go from laughter to tears, amazement to horror. This simple tale of an Italian-Jewish family caught in the horror of the holocaust is centred around the relationship between a man and his wife and son. The script is full of great lines which make you laugh when you'd rather cry. In all it's a tale of hope and of love and the thwarted desire to live a simple life. The cinematography is brilliant and the plot extraordinary. A must see!!!

Yet another example of small European cinemas making pure quality entertainment. This film, full to the brim with wit and satire shows the beauty of life and the horror that is war.

Incredibly giving porn a bad name, SHOWGIRLS not only has the typical non-existent plot and bad acting of a skin flick, it also obviates any t&a value by tossing in a disturbing scene guaranteed to leave a bad taste in the mouths of viewers who found this drivel arousing.

The look of the film is simply superb.  The special-effects make the movie fun. Without being so seamless, it plays with them instead of showing them off like other movies.  The characters were pretty interesting.  Although Maureen Robinson (mom) and Penny (youngest daughter) are slightly under-used, I still felt the movie was fulfilling.  The action sequences were great, inventive, and at times, original.  If I had to pick my favorite part, I would say the whole movie was my favorite.  The film flashed outstanding visuals, an interesting plot, and cheezy, yet effective special-effects.  And the music by Bruce Broughton was outstanding. ***1\/2 out of ****.  8 out of 10.

What always draws me into the film is how epic it is and the long emotional journeys the characters undergo. Copola said that his film wasn't about Vietnam, it was Vietnam, and that the whole thing was crazy. I have to agree with that, as a student of Psychology and as a member of the human race.As for technical aspects, the film looks great, beautiful shots of Hueys and the Phillipeens really sell this tale of the Vietnam war. The acting of the boat crew and all the other suporting cast is outstanding, with Martin Shean's blending in perfectly. The only gripe I have is in regards to Marlon Brando's performance, it was lack luster right up until the last ten minutes of the film. When watching this at home I often wonder why he didn't just phone in his dialogue and let them use a body double. I know this is an unpopular view, but it is how I feel, even though I am a big Brando fan. All in all, one of my favorite films of all time.
