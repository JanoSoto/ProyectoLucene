Following in the footsteps of STAR WARS IV A NEW HOPE, this film actually copies that formula very well. An assortment of heroes (human, alien, and robotic) band together to save a queen (in STAR WARS it was a princess) from a galactic terror The Trade Federation (in STAR WARS it was the evil Empire).PHANTOM MENACE gets off to a promising and exciting start with 2 Jedi knights Qui-Gon Jinn (played excellently by Liam Neeson, who does a good job carrying the film as the lead) and young Obi-Wan Kenobi (reliably played by Ewan McGregor, who would obviously continue the role in the other 2 prequels) landing on the Federation ship to discuss the terms of a treaty between the Federation and the Imperial Senate, but the evil Federation leader tries to have them killed. The Federation is also holding the planet Naboo hostage, so the Jedi rescue the Queen Amidala (a captivating young Natalie Portman) and hide her out in the remote planet of Tatooine, the home of young Anakin Skywalker (we all know who he becomes!).On Tatooine, Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan learn that this boy Skywalker (played by the very young Jake Lloyd) is blessed w\/ the powers of The Force and enlist him in a pod race to win money to pay for their ship parts and repairs. This pod race scene is one of the most exciting modern-day action sequences ever put to film. An example of when CGI totally works! I NEVER tire of seeing it. If you don't like ANY OTHER scene in this film, you've got to like this one! Unbeknowst to the Jedis, there is a more evil force pulling the strings of the Federation, a dark knight Darth Sidius who compels them to get the treaty signed. Sidius enlists an apprentice, Darth Maul, to help move things along.The Jedi (bringing Anakin with them to be trained as a Jedi) get the queen to Coruscant, the home planet of the Imperial Senate and the Jedi Council. Residing at the head of the Jedi is none other than our good friend Yoda! The 2nd-in-command on the council is Mace Windu (effectively played by Samuel L.

What I like about THE PHANTOM MENACE is that it is much like the first STAR WARS in that it is fast-paced (although it contains a lot more dialogue and scenes and of course CGI) and is just about adventure. It doesn't care about back-story or reasons or character motivations. The four-pronged finale of (1) Amidala and her royal guard fighting palace droids, (2) the Gungans fighting the techno-troopers, (3) Anakin and the Naboo pilots attacking the Federation shiop, and (4) the lightsaber duel of Qui-Gon\/Obi-Wan battling Maul is exhilarating. Of course there are some noticeable minuses. *Jar Jar Binks and the Gungans are not good characters and it seemed a bit tacked on how they were the key to defeating the Trade Federation in the climactic attack. *Because Jake Lloyd is featured as young Anakin and has quite a bit to do, it is somewhat hard to take that he is going to be Darth Vader one day.

Connery plays the legendary British secret agent and is assigned to locate and recapture two missing atomic missiles, which have been appropriated by sinister fat cat millionaire Celi. Complicating things for both Connery and Celi is Celi's female houseguest Auger, who feels loyalty towards him, though she is unaware that he has killed her brother in order to make his plan come to fruition. Also in the mix is Celi's henchwoman Paluzzi, who uses her considerable wiles to aid in getting the jobs done. Connery, with the aid of American spy Nutter, eventually locates the missiles, but retrieving them will mean a virtual undersea war between scuba divers on opposite teams. Fans of Connery will enjoy this entry a lot as he tends to be featured in practically every scene. He also shows off his hirsute chest and legs more than in practically any other film outside of Zardoz since he is frequently seen in trunks, a towel or otherwise stripped down! This was reportedly his favorite experience of all the Bond films he made. Celi (whose voice was dubbed by another actor) is an effectively dangerous adversary. Auger (whose voice was also dubbed) is lovely and shows off her pageant-ready physique in several swimsuits. Paluzzi is afforded the fun role here as a beautiful, but quite heartless, villainess. Nutter is given little of note to do in a role that was recast practically every time it recurred in the series. Further feminine attractiveness is provided by Beswick, as a cohort of Connery's, and by Peters, as a curvy masseuse. This is one of the less globetrotting installments with most of the story taking place in one locale &#150; The Bahamas. However, the most is made of the location, augmented by the typically awesome Ken Adams sets. A large parade was staged as well, to add to the local color. Many Bond films feature underwater set pieces, but this one spends roughly a fourth of its running time beneath the waves. Some viewers complain of this slowing down the pace and bogging down the action, though the underwater photography and staging were first rate for the time. This film also contains some of the more imaginative gadgetry of the early years, though much of it is utilized during the action-filled prologue. One unfortunate aspect to some of the scenes is the use of under-cranking the camera in order to speed up the fight scenes and other moments (this is especially hilarious when Connery is strapped to a stretching machine and jerked around frantically.) Initially, a theme song called Mr. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang recorded by Dionne Warwick was to be used, but at the 11th hour the producers opted for a title song instead.

Nicholson packs his suitcase intending to leave his wife, Judy Davis, and his stepson, Steven Dorff, and run off to New York with his innocent girl friend, Jennifer Lopez. In New York, he intends to sell the hot ice to a fence and return to split the cash with Caine.At the last moment, Nicholson has an argument with his wife, she clobbers him with a poker, frantically throws some clothes into Nicholson's suitcase, and drives off with her son. The necklace is stashed in a compartment of the suitcase, although neither she nor Dorff knows it.They find out soon enough. Nicholson and Caine track them to Key Largo and there are arguments, fights, a car chase, until Davis and Caine wind up dead, Dorff takes off in his new boat for the horizon, Lopez drives off alone with one of the stones, and Nicholson winds up in the hands of the law.It has a lot going for it. Nicholson and Caine rarely go wrong. Judy Davis does hysteria well. Jennifer Lopez is a natural actress, a beautiful young woman with a cantilevered rear end. The locations include some of the more colorful parts of Florida. And there's one effective action scene during, and immediately after, the car chase.So why doesn't it work any better than it does? It's a mean-spirited movie. Every character seems greedy, spiteful, and deceitful. There's nobody to root for. It's easy to argue that this is rather more like real life than having good and evil splashed across the screen, but the values don't go much beyond that. No one has any particularly generous impulses. If someone dies, they simply disappear from the story. The only scene in which a genuine conflict of motives appears is when Nicholson is rooting around the bloodied body of his dying wife in an overturned car, searching desperately for the stupid necklace and sobbing with remorse at the same time. And even this is undercut by pettiness. Her last words to Nicholson **** you. The ill-considered roles cripple the performances too. Nobody is poor, but no one has a chance to do much more than try to outwit the others. It's also disturbing to see actors we like, like Caine and Nicholson, in parts so petty. They're fine when they are outrageously malignant and venomous. (Nicholson ululating hoarsely and limping through the snow with an ax in his hands.) But realistically, as reprobate as the rest of us? Nope.I also can't understand why the location shooting doesn't take advantage of Miami and the Keys, where it was clearly shot. We see mostly interiors and back yards. Even a fishing boat in the Gulf of Florida feels claustrophobic. There's no sense of space or even of the city. And the photography doesn't help, somehow nudging a viewer into the perception that southern Florida is chilly rather than shimmering in humidity and heat. Where's the sweat? John Huston's Key Largo was all shot on a Warner Brothers' sound stage and does a better job of establishing the atmosphere. Finally, the MacGuffin -- that million-dollar necklace -- bespeaking a lack of imagination. Sounds like a job for Charlie Chan.Well, I don't mean to be too harsh. It's not badly done. It's just that so many opportunities for it to have been better were missed in the script and in the direction. Disappointing.

The necklace is stashed in a compartment of the suitcase, although neither she nor Dorff knows it.They find out soon enough. Nicholson and Caine track them to Key Largo and there are arguments, fights, a car chase, until Davis and Caine wind up dead, Dorff takes off in his new boat for the horizon, Lopez drives off alone with one of the stones, and Nicholson winds up in the hands of the law.It has a lot going for it. Nicholson and Caine rarely go wrong. Judy Davis does hysteria well. Jennifer Lopez is a natural actress, a beautiful young woman with a cantilevered rear end. The locations include some of the more colorful parts of Florida. And there's one effective action scene during, and immediately after, the car chase.So why doesn't it work any better than it does? It's a mean-spirited movie. Every character seems greedy, spiteful, and deceitful. There's nobody to root for. It's easy to argue that this is rather more like real life than having good and evil splashed across the screen, but the values don't go much beyond that. No one has any particularly generous impulses. If someone dies, they simply disappear from the story. The only scene in which a genuine conflict of motives appears is when Nicholson is rooting around the bloodied body of his dying wife in an overturned car, searching desperately for the stupid necklace and sobbing with remorse at the same time. And even this is undercut by pettiness. Her last words to Nicholson **** you. The ill-considered roles cripple the performances too. Nobody is poor, but no one has a chance to do much more than try to outwit the others. It's also disturbing to see actors we like, like Caine and Nicholson, in parts so petty. They're fine when they are outrageously malignant and venomous. (Nicholson ululating hoarsely and limping through the snow with an ax in his hands.) But realistically, as reprobate as the rest of us? Nope.I also can't understand why the location shooting doesn't take advantage of Miami and the Keys, where it was clearly shot. We see mostly interiors and back yards. Even a fishing boat in the Gulf of Florida feels claustrophobic. There's no sense of space or even of the city. And the photography doesn't help, somehow nudging a viewer into the perception that southern Florida is chilly rather than shimmering in humidity and heat. Where's the sweat? John Huston's Key Largo was all shot on a Warner Brothers' sound stage and does a better job of establishing the atmosphere. Finally, the MacGuffin -- that million-dollar necklace -- bespeaking a lack of imagination. Sounds like a job for Charlie Chan.Well, I don't mean to be too harsh. It's not badly done.

It would be more accurate to say it takes the story of Ripley and those slimy, malevolent lifeforms in a direction that the first movie didn't even try to; specifically, into the realm of action\/adventure\/combat flicks. To its credit, it keeps much of the original's look and feel, in art direction and sound. But the volume (so to speak) is cranked WAY up, as is the violence quotient, and the last 45 minutes or so feel like a roller-coaster ride through hell. Opinions differ whether or not this is an improvement; my own feeling is that 'Alien' is the superior film, hands down. But 'Aliens' certainly won the box office battle and has always been more generally popular. The plot has Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) going back to the deadly planet with a squad of 'colonial marines.' It is 57 years later (she slept that long in suspended animation before being discovered) and the planet is now inhabited by humans in a small, desolate community. The aliens (and there are a bunch of them now) never bothered the colonists until recently and when contact with Earth ceases, the marines are sent in and Ripley goes with them as a reluctant 'advisor.' The marines themselves are a colorful group of stereotypes, straight out of an old WW2 war flick- the tough-as-nails sergeant, the quiet loner, the two bad-ass machine gunners, the whiner, etc. They are led by an ineffective lieutenant who we soon discover isn't up to the challenge. Also along for the ride is the 'company man,' Burke (Paul Reiser, in a nice turn as a complete slimeball). After an early encounter with the aliens cuts their number in half, Ripley more or less assumes command by sheer force of personality. (And Weaver out-acts the pants off whoever she shares the screen with.) There are plenty of slam-bang shoot-'em-up sequences, all very well staged and very intense. But somewhere along the way, 'Aliens' diminishes the essential creepiness of the creatures just slightly by making them so often exploding targets. And the audience realizes long before the marines that it doesn't matter how many of them you kill, there are always more. A single colony survivor, a young girl named Newt, is adopted by Ripley and the others and proves more savvy than any of them. There is a funny, scary moment early on shortly after Newt is found; Ripley asks her if she wouldn't feel safer staying with Ripley and the others. The little girl just shakes her head no. Ripley goes on to say these are soldiers, and Newt responds, It won't make any difference. After chases, explosions, more gunplay and one false climax, we get the final showdown between Ripley, in one of the spaceship's loaders, and the alien queen. (Trying to distract the queen from pursuing Newt, Weaver spits out her famous line, Get away from her, you bitch!) The fight itself is fairly brief, and the queen is finally dispatched off out into space, much like the alien in the first film was. Director James Cameron certainly deserves credit for not making a boring sequel; 'Aliens' is anything but. It would probably be hoping for too much to expect a second film to be as wondrously terrifying as Ridley Scott's original; like capturing lightning twice, almost impossible. So Cameron wisely shifts gears and takes us on a different adventure altogether, and it's a very exciting one.

Though he tries to convince his fellow crewmen Cliff, (John Keenan) Marty, (Ron Rifkin) and Andy (Jesse Vint) that what their doing is unconscionable, they point out it's only a job and not their decision. Lowell realizes he has no choice but to choose between his friends and his mission. In his care are three tiny robots which become an integral part of the movie and add to the final ingredients which propels this film into the annals of Classic cinema. This role will become the epitome of Bruce Dern's career. **** ","genre":"Drama, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"6 January 2009","score":"29 out of 43 people found the following review useful","review":" Francis Ford Coppola's atrocious version of the Bram Stoker classic is updated for the MTV generation.Coppola eschews everything that made the novel scary -- atmosphere, creepiness, subtlety, things fluttering in the shadows -- and replaces it with gore, busy camera-work, shock editing and a relentlessly frantic pace.

From the funny protagonists to the simple powerful storyline, this is a fine romantic film.Far from a guy likes girl flick, this looks at the intricate ways men and women look at each other. Harry in particular brings up a valid point in that sex will always get in the way of a guy and a girl ever being friends. This concept, represented at a highly inconvenient moment, is incredibly funny and importantly relative.Crystal (The Princess Bride) and Ryan (You've got mail) deliver knockout performances with Ryan in particular very charming. Ryan has created that vulnerable but opinionated persona on screen that many viewers will relate to. And obviously not forgetting that infamous scene in the restaurant.

The problem is that it's not a baby of the little people so someone will have to take it safely back to the land of the big people. Unfortunately the evil Queen has been told of the arrival of the promised child whom she believes will usurp her power over the earth. She calls on her soldiers to find the child and kill it.

A dwarf called Willow has the unpleasant job of carrying the baby to safety beyond the river through dangerous territory. The evil Queen's soldiers are everywhere so it won't be easy. Willow is a bit of a magician at heart and the wizard has given him some advice. The rest of the story is an adventure as Willow and the baby overcome every imaginable adversity.When Willow reaches the vicinity of the Queen's castle he is in grave danger of the Queen's wrath and cruel intent.

This is and always will be my favorite film. Great directing, script, cinematography, music and acting.The romance of Sunrise to me is in the thing about connecting, about being able to talk about anything with this person from the very start, and in the idea of falling in love in such a short amount of time. Call it love at first conversation! Many beautiful things to comment on, so I'll just pick one the most meaningful scene of Sunrise to me is at the end, when we are shown the places they had been the night before. Those shots of morning Vienna convey the intensity of the love that we feel between the characters in the sequel, Before Sunset. Jesse and Celine had only met the night before, they were trying to be rational the whole time, not making a fuss over their imminent separation, agreeing not to keep in touch by letter or phone because of the distance. They are being rational up to the final scene when they agree in a rush to meet six months later. It is the only scene where they admit to themselves and to each other the strength of the feelings they would probably only later acknowledge as love, at some point during the nine years before their second encounter. So the shots of the places where they'd been gain importance after the scene where they part having agreed to meet again, because we\/them now see the city as a fundamental part\/witness to their love.Nevertheless, as we see Vienna coming back to life under the morning sun, everything is normal to the unfeeling city, except to us they are not there anymore. It's like they had never been there, despite the fact that the city felt like an important ingredient in their story. The place has forgotten them, even though it was only a few hours after their separation. Vienna doesn't hold any memory of them, it's them who hold a memory of Vienna. Obvious of course, I mean you wouldn't expect a street named after every couple who fell in love in a city! but still very symbolically sad, because you tend to think of some places as eternal, and will store things for you that you yourself have lost, and all the more so because Jesse and Celine's encounter almost shouldn't have taken place, it was unplanned and improbable, fleetingly ephemeral.This is a film where nothing much happens, only great conversation and life-changing connection.

For 'strong', read 'foul'. And in 95% of cases, totally unnecessary. Because 'Ed Wood' is a superb film, easily Depp's best performance (and incidentally serves the very useful purpose of making the POTC series look even worse than they actually are). But Lugosi seemingly uttering at least one profanity in every line comes close to ruining it.Right - let's get positive.

Robert De Niro plays the chain-smoking control freak Sam Rothstein, who is put in charge of the Tangiers casino by his mob buddies, most notably Nicky Santoro. Santoro is played by the one and only Joe Pesci, who may very well have topped his performance in Goodfellas. Nicky is a killer, thief, gambler, and muscle-man, who wants the world and is willing to go over the heads of his bosses to get it. Sharon Stone completes the trifecta of immorality as Ginger, a hustler who Sam convinces to marry him even though he knows she doesn't love him. Though the movie is largely the story of the mob embezzlement of Vegas, and the inner-workings, dynamics and politics of running a casino, the relationship between the three main characters is key to the plot.The plot is told unconventionally, and as the story takes place over the span of ten years, many of its scenes feel like anecdotes. But each one adds something great to the whole story. Everything builds to something, there's not one wasted second in the entire 3 hours. It seems to go by very quickly because it is so entertaining. The three leads are absolutely flawless and the drama that unfolds is truly engrossing. All three change as the movie progresses. Ginger starts off as a happy, free-spirited woman, but when she marries Sam she starts a descent into darkness. Sam's controlling tendencies are largely to blame for her slide into drug abuse, greed and compulsive lying. She resents him controlling her, he doesn't trust her enough to give her any space. She spirals further by running away with their kid and Lester, then later tying the kid to the bed when she went out to drink. Sam is the kind of person who tries to do the right thing in all situations, but with Ginger he sometimes overreacts and escalates problems further. Their deteriorating relationship threatens to sink the whole casino scam.Meanwhile Sam's over-protectiveness of his own casino lands him in hot water with the gaming commission, and Nicky's own actions make him a target for the FBI. Both are unable to let go of the monster that they created, Nicky refusing to leave town to let the heat on him cool down, and Sam unable to step out of the limelight of running the casino. The relationship between Nicky and Ginger is interesting because for once we see a human side of Nicky. She ends up sleeping with him, complicating things further. When the house of cards quite literally comes down, the bullets fly in classic Scorsese style. Only Sam is left unscathed, somehow coming full circle, hopefully a much wiser man.Scorsese directs this movie at full-speed, tearing open the rotten underside of Vegas in the 1970s for all to see. From taking us into the inner workings of casinos, to mob shakedowns, husband and wife quarrels, political manoeuvring, and tying it all together, you're always involved. This is a must-see film and one of the best of the 90's.

Basically it is 1954, and we are following a group of high school teens going through puberty, and only thing on their minds, sex. We have horny toad Pee Wee (Dan Monahan), bad boy Tommy (Wyatt Knight), tough jock and abnormally packaged Meat (Tony Ganios), wise-ass redneck without any care Mickey (Roger Wilson), smart Jew Brian Schwartz (Scott Colomby), and racist Tim (Cyril O'Reilly). So they are peaking through holes to the girl's shower room, and making life difficult for teachers and each other, and then they find striptease bar Porky's, only to be thrown out and humiliated soon after entering. They realise they won't get in, so they plan revenge, but they know that owner Porky (Chuck Mitchell), his brother is Sheriff Wallace (Alex Karras), making it difficult, and they also have to forget their differences to work together. Also starring Mark Herrier as Billy, young Sex and the City's Kim Cattrall as Honeywell, Kaki Hunter as Wendy, Nancy Parsons as Ms. Balbricker and Susan Clark as Cherry Forever. The highlights of the film for me are young Cattrall having sex, and her screams echoing in the below basketball court, and after peaking at the girls, one of the guys sticks his penis through one of the holes, and gets it clutched by the teacher. It is quite tasteless, but there is a tiny strange sense of charm about it also, a quite entertaining comedy. Worth watching!

Basically Matt Sullivan (30 Days of Night's Josh Hartnett) broke up with Nicole (Vinessa Shaw) months ago, who is now engaged to someone else, he meanwhile has no problem finding new lovers, but he can't help wanting her back. He also finds himself getting a little depressed with all the sex he is having, so he has the inspiration from a priest to give up sex for 40 days and 40 nights, just like Lent, no sexual acts at all, even kissing or masturbation, to get his perspective he needs. His roommate Ryan (Road Trip's Paulo Costanzo) is not convinced he can do it, and after telling many people he and a couple of others have a huge bet saying he will give up. Unfortunately, for Matt, he may be finding it more difficult when quite a while in, he has the met the girl of his dreams, Erica Sutton (A Knight's Tale's Shannyn Sossamon). Oh, don't worry, she finds out what he's doing, and they do get together, but with no bodily contact whatsoever, a very sexy scene involving a flower says it all. Oh, Matt is also having proposals by many women, getting some pornography, and towards the end of the lent, seeing things, e.g. women naked in the street, an ocean of breasts, so he is obviously desperate for it to end soon. So it comes to day 40, but he didn't finish properly, unfortunately mean Nicole spoilt it just minutes before midnight, by jerking him off, and it was meant to be Erica after the clock strike. Don't worry, he adds 10 days extra to make it up, and he and Erica finally have their first kiss, and having numerous (at least 40) sessions, a very happy ending indeed. Also starring Maggie Gyllenhaal as Sam, Glenn Fitzgerald as Chris, Griffin Dunne as Jerry and Adam Trese as John Sullivan. Hartnett proves himself a good comic lead, Sossamon is still beautiful, and you will enjoy her in the flower scene, trust me, a very likable romantic comedy. Good!
