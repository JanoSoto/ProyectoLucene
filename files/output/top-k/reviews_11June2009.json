[{"date":"11 June 2009","score":"","review":" Good storytelling and high school comedies seem to never go hand-in-hand, especially when MTV is involved, but Election breaks that barrier. Sure, it helps that it's more dark comedy and involves adult topics and situations, but Alexander Payne has crafted a film that surpasses high school clichés. He skillfully juggles four highly developed protagonists at once, three of them high school students, and manages to squeeze something more than a coming-of-age story out of them.Adapted from a novel by Tom Perrotta, Election centers around the titular event, in particular one for high school president. Overachiever Tracy Flick (Witherspoon) expects to run unopposed, but student government adviser Jim McAllister (Broderick) strongly dislikes her after her affair with another teacher, one Jim was friends with, got the teacher fired. Disgusted by the idea of her getting another something she wants without consequence, Jim inspires the injured quarterback of the football team, Paul Metzler (Chris Klein), to run against her. As if that weren't enough, Paul's younger sister Tammy, a sophomore, decides to run when her best friend ditches her and starts dating Paul.Payne's screenplay calls for a lot of narration among these four characters. We get inside their heads to learn of their conscious desire for why they're running or in Jim's case trying to ruin Tracy, but what we see on screen, of course, are some major subconscious motives. For example, everything going on in Jim's personal life -- his inability to get his wife pregnant and his eye for his recently divorced friend -- bleeds into his conduct at school. His narration says life was going good, when we see he's already making the choices that will lead to a foreshadowed end. Payne executes narrative here the way it's supposed to be done. It might seem overwhelming with four characters, but the transition is logical and often times clever.These are four great characters too, with the perfect actors in their parts. Each is given a clear portrait, characteristics that we like and dislike. Jim is an excellent, award-winning teacher with a sound moral compass, then again he denies issues in his personal life. Broderick's boyish looks but good dramatic skills have always helped him play double-sided characters. Tracy is ruthless and cares way too much, but we see her lonely side too, her fear when she crosses the line as portrayed well in her inner-monologue by Witherspoon. Klein plays an excellent Paul, dumb and naive, but well-intentioned and lovable. Then Tammy, with her rebellious exterior, seems to be the most honest.Unlike most high school comedies, the dark nature of the humor in Election keeps the events of the film mostly unpredictable, the surprising actions taken by the students and Jim throughout the story to get their way can be startling, unsettling or even emotional at times. This isn't your typical high school revenge story, the characters make choices based on their personal lives, their deep character issues, not strictly for laughs or because their jock or goody two-shoes stereotype calls for it. Payne establishes that this film is really about the democratic ideas of the election, the choices we make in our lives and the underlying moral or morally questionable desires that guide them in sometimes irrational ways. Whether in high school or older, we still make those choices all the time. To Payne, we can actually find meaning in high school drama in addition to humor.

Over time, the effectiveness of using these related actors has enhanced the film's status greatly. The story itself is a familiar one to students of post-Civil War American history. After riding with Confederate guerrilla outfits such as Quantrill's Raiders and Bloody Bill Anderson during the war, Jesse and Frank James and the Younger boys (Cole, Bob, and Jim) continued their careers as outlaws, terrorizing banks, railroads and everything and everyone else that crossed their path. We done it for Dixie, was their common mantra and The Long Riders plays on the boys' Southern sympathies without excusing any of their actions.The Keach Brothers (Stacy and James) are a good match for Frank and Jesse James, but the casting of the Carradine brothers (David, Robert and Keith) is the masterstroke for director Hill. The rest of acting is also inspired; Dennis and Randy Quaid are excellent as the Millers and Christopher and Nicholas Guest are standouts as Jesse's assassins, Charlie and Bob Ford. Pamela Reed is also around as a fairly attractive Belle Starr with James Remar looking ominous as her half-breed husband, Sam Starr.

The film is really a winner for it's realism and truthfulness that has occurred with so many small towns in America I for one know because being from a small town saw the changes of how things drift from people moving away to the old timers passing away and seeing how love relationships come and go. Many may say this film is not their style as they feel put off for it being set in a small town, and many feel the film is controversial as they think it in ways was a sexual exploration film. And true in many ways for 1971 director Peter Bogdanovich did push the envelope with many of the scenes by showing frontal skin nudity. Still so much more can be taken and learned from this acclaimed social drama that's direct and outspoken.The time and place is 1951 in the small town of Anarene, Texas and this film was adapted from a screenplay by author Larry McMurtry(who's the king of Texas literary stories that get made into hit films, exBrokeback Mountain and Terms of Endearment). As in many ways aside from this being a film of social change it's a good film of character study as the film focuses mainly on the towns youth. And as you see in many of the scenes from the old country store, to high school athletic games, and parties this reminds anyone who grew up in a small town just what it was like as they see so clearly in the scenes. The most bittersweet themes touched upon in the film are the times we most remember of peer pressure the way it related to love. As the films take on sex from having sex the first time to one night stands and having an affair with an older woman was displayed in such a blunt frank manner. As all of us dealt with those issues growing up being in a small town as most of it was discovered for escapism. Most important this social classic teaches us that nothing last forever in a small town still memories will last forever.The cast is star struck and talented with good turns from Jeff Bridges and Timothy Bottoms and veterans Cloris Leachman, Ben Johnson, and Ellen Burstyn give good supporting performances. The most notable standout was the introduction of the stunning and smooth beauty Cybill Shepherd as her scenes of skin are very memorable and her character as the all American girl can have any viewer think back to a girl of that kind that they knew in high school. Overall the Last Picture Show in my opinion is a film that's a treasured classic for it's realism that in ways was ahead of it's time as anyone knows being from a small town the drifting changes that takes place among people and the community and escapism is many times the only hope. Mainly the escape is found thru memories and love with friendship yet this film took the theme of sex and used it as an escape tool for small town America which really pushed the envelope the way it showed it in 1971 still that was one element that made this an unforgettable classic gem.

You get the Clint Eastwood spaghetti western called Unforgiven. Not bad at all if you ask me. One lady gets badly disrespected by two good for nothing cowboys. The friends of the poor, helpless lady band together to try to teach those punks a lesson. They call for the assassination of the men and put out a reward for their lives.From the beginning of the movie two men looking for a good time find themselves in a whore house. One of the whores laughs at one of the men for not being to impressive. That sends the man over the edge. He grabs for his knife and starts taking swipes at the poor lady. After nearly gutting her face off the owner of the place puts a gun to the cowboys head and demands he leaves. So her whore friends band together and try to take a stand for what little respect they get. They put out a word that 1000 dollars goes to whoever kills the men that nearly killed their friend. Eastwood plays Bill, who is an ex assassin. One of the roughest, toughest men ever in all of the mid-west. Struggling to put his dark past behind him he needs the money to help his family get by. The large reward really sounds tempting and leads him to become a killer again, but this time for a good cause.For the most part I really enjoyed this move. I understand that it was a low budget film so I wasn't expecting too much as far as effects or cast. Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman make a great team. They click very well on screen and off. I really think that Freeman did a great job as a supporting character. He did well playing Eastwood's right hand man. The setting was very good as well. I could never be able to tell that his movie was filmed over seas.I'm not usually a fan of western films but this one I happened to enjoy. Partly because I am a fan of the two main actors but none the less if you like western movies then this is a good one for you. Clint and Morgan do amazing jobs as usual. They capture the characters just as you would expect from Oscar winning actors. Job well done on the movie Unforgiven.

Most people call this a remake, but I call it a re-imagining. The Curse of Frankenstein is different from the early Universal version and in my opinion, much, much better. It explores the relationship between the characters and it develops them more deeply than previous versions. It begins when Victor Frankenstein (Played by the great Peter Cushing) is in prison and is sentenced to the guillotine. He confesses his story to a priest. The young Baron's parents die and he is left with the family fortune. Since a very young age, we see the young Victor (played by Melvyn Hayes) as an intelligent, curious, but controlling and obsessive character. Later he hires Paul Krempe (played by Robert Urquhart) as his teacher and mentor. Throughout the course of the years, they become good friends and work together to discover the mysteries of science. Years later, Victor Frankenstein is an adult is visited by his cousin Elizabeth (played by Hazel Court), who is the Baron's fiancée and are arranged to get married, but Victor is more obsessed with his experiments. Finally Victor and Paul discover a way to animate the dead by reviving a dead dog. Trilled, Victor wants to go further with his experiment, but Paul's moral values contradicts Victor's ambition and decides to abandon the experiment, leaving Victor alone to do his work. But Victor's obsession takes him to a new and dangerous level and even commits murder to get what he wants. Frankenstein successfully creates a creature (Played by the legendary Christopher Lee) but is not what he expected and instead of abandoning his experiments he continues the work, but the creature becomes more and more dangerous.The photography, set design, acting, script, and direction are stunning and the movie, in my opinion, stands the test of time. This film is what made Hammer Films so big. They were so successful that they made hundreds of legendary Gothic horror film and still today, have a following. If you want to do your own classic horror festival, be sure to include The Curse of Frankenstein.

It begins when Victor Frankenstein (Played by the great Peter Cushing) is in prison and is sentenced to the guillotine. He confesses his story to a priest. The young Baron's parents die and he is left with the family fortune. Since a very young age, we see the young Victor (played by Melvyn Hayes) as an intelligent, curious, but controlling and obsessive character. Later he hires Paul Krempe (played by Robert Urquhart) as his teacher and mentor. Throughout the course of the years, they become good friends and work together to discover the mysteries of science. Years later, Victor Frankenstein is an adult is visited by his cousin Elizabeth (played by Hazel Court), who is the Baron's fiancée and are arranged to get married, but Victor is more obsessed with his experiments. Finally Victor and Paul discover a way to animate the dead by reviving a dead dog. Trilled, Victor wants to go further with his experiment, but Paul's moral values contradicts Victor's ambition and decides to abandon the experiment, leaving Victor alone to do his work. But Victor's obsession takes him to a new and dangerous level and even commits murder to get what he wants. Frankenstein successfully creates a creature (Played by the legendary Christopher Lee) but is not what he expected and instead of abandoning his experiments he continues the work, but the creature becomes more and more dangerous.The photography, set design, acting, script, and direction are stunning and the movie, in my opinion, stands the test of time. This film is what made Hammer Films so big. They were so successful that they made hundreds of legendary Gothic horror film and still today, have a following.

When sea faring Sterling Haden's pop is killed, how will Haden put an end to TERROR IN A Texas TOWN, armed only with a harpoon? First off, this isn't a B-western. There are no singing cowboys, no daredevil stunts, no interesting action sequences. It's just an independent movie -- you know, the ones that use unimportant actors to say important things and cover the general low budget vapidity of the goings on with Interesting Camera Angles.Second, this movie, to avoid compromises (one expects) that would cause the elimination of Trumbo's Important Statements about Justice in America, and the rather sick relationship between the chief henchman and his girl, IS really low budget. The main problem that causes is that the acting is really, really bad. Sterling Haden is decent enough in tough roles, but he is the last guy you want playing a sensitive Swedish sailor gone to find his fortune in the West. Sebastian Cabot tries to do a Sydney Greenstreet as (very) bloated plutocrat. It's not a bad idea, but Cabot does not have the acting chops for it. The guy who plays the hired gun with the missing arm and soul (Johnny Crale) has the best role in the film. He does nothing with it.Third, the script really isn't all that. Trumbo gets some digs in about the immigrant isn't going to get a fair shake from the sheriff in a corrupt town, and the people, when up against real oppression tend to back down. This is a pretty stale movie message by 1958 -- High Noon, Bad Day at Black Rock, Devil's Doorway -- are all Westerns that deal with the evils of Western society with an eye to the evils of 50s America. Trumbo, in '59, certainly had every personal reason to agree with those sentiments, but he isn't doing anything new or interesting with them.So, given all the negatives, why does this movie get a 4? Mostly because there are interesting quirks throughout the movie. (The relationship between Crale and his girl is, um fascinating.) And Trumbo, while a mediocre writer when pursuing his political affectations, is very good in creating both interesting characters and intelligent interactions between them. Just when one is ready to pass out from Indy movie boredom, will come an exchange of dialog or simple quirkiness that gets one realize that guy writing the script was not simply a hack.If you don't like Trumbo or westerns, give this one a miss.

But you are sort of restricted visually when your first requirement is to tell a fairly straightforward story. So I'd like to go back and develop pure visual storytelling. Because to me, it's one of the most exciting aspects of making movies and almost a lost art at this point. - Brian De PalmaThere's a scene in Brian De Palma's Carlito's Way in which Al Pacino stands outside his lover's door, watching as she slowly undresses. Pacino pants like a dog in heat, salivating over the beauty of her naked body. Unable to contain himself he breaks the door down and lunges for his woman, their lips locking as he embraces her soft flesh. De Palma's camera then giddily circles the couple, You Are So Beautiful blazing on the soundtrack. The moment of passion escalates, the camera circling faster and faster, their feverish kisses becoming more wet, more sloppy, until she looks into Pacino's eyes and says Where's my cheesecake?It is with moments like these that director Brian De Palma acknowledges that Carlito's Way is one giant slice of cheese. This is art for art's sake, a purely formal exercise in which De Palma indulges his fetish for sexy aesthetics. He pushes every motion and emotion to operatic proportions, ringing every ounce of drama from what is really a fairly generic plot. With its impeccable compositions, precise camera work, glacial tracking shots, baroque tone, sublime action sequences and flamboyant acting, this is a film in love with its own form. But for a film so preoccupied with surfaces, it's remarkable how much emotion De Palma wrings out of his cast. De Palma has a fondness for bad actors, often deliberately casting them as props or undermining their performances. Indeed, his leading men (Michael J Fox, Josh Hartnett, John Travolta etc) are often clueless actors who themselves play clueless characters, and his leading women (Melanie Griffith, Scarlett Johansson, Rebecca Romjin, Nancy Allen etc) are often models or vacuous pretty faces who likewise play airheads, hookers or prostitutes. This is a guy preoccupied with surface beauty, even as his films are explicitly preoccupied with the dirty veneer behind such surfaces (Redacted, for example, is about the lie behind beautifully composed photographs). And even when De Palma does cast genuine talent (Pacino, Penn, Lithgow) he has them play larger than life characters, their raging opera performances designed to match his shamelessly grandiose vision.In Carlito's Way De Palma has Al Pacino play Carlito Brigante, an ageing gangster who has recently been released from jail. Carlito is determined to go straight, staying out of trouble until he can amass enough money to retire to some paradisaical tropic island. It's a generic plot, but Pacino and De Palma mesh so perfectly that the film eventually transcends its B movie premise and becomes, at times, something a bit more sublime. Odd for a gangster movie, Way aligns itself firmly with the world of noir. Gangster movies typically follow a fairly obvious narrative progression. We get rise, the good times, and the fall, the bad times. Carlito's Way is odd in that it treats the fall as a forgone conclusion, its dying protagonist narrating his death dream like Fred MacMurray in Double Indemnity. This is a conspiratorial world, Carlito pulled around like a puppet on a string by some unseen, cosmic noir God. Indeed, upon being released from jail, every action Carlito does, every choice he makes, is righteous and admirable. And yet noir fatalism thwarts him at every turn, his choices unable to halt an almost predetermined finale. And so the Way of the film's title refers both to Carlito's spiritual path, his newfound desire to be good and do right, but also something more inexorable; the way, the fixed route. Rehabilitated or not, Carlito's tragedy is that there was never any chance of escape.And so while in Scarface Pacino's manic performance gelled perfectly with De Palma's cocaine inspired direction, in Carlito's Way his forlorn eyes mesh flawlessly with De Palma's melancholic visuals. At 53 years of age, Pacino's face has never looked this beautifully tragic. Framed by a jet black beard, Pacino walks about like Jesus on a good hair day, suffering for sins he can not atone. Already dead, he spends the film always dressed in black, navigating his death dream like a fallen angel. Watch too how Pacino spends the film alternating between a stance of fast-talking macho posturing and one of melancholic regret. He wears the face of a corpse, of defeat and acceptance, his flashes of confidence a hip old mask which doesn't know if its going or staying.And yet in death Carlito does receive a spiritual redemption of sorts. He may not have escaped his past, but he does help his lover, a stripper who dreams of being a ballerina, escape hers. And so when De Palma chooses to end the film with another airing of You Are So Beautiful, we know that the song has a dual function. We celebrates Carlito's newfound spiritual beauty, but also the aesthetic beauty of De Palma's filmic world.8.5\/10 - Stylish. De Palma's one of the few directors able to convey a sense of true three dimensional space.

A computer generated dream world that was created a long time ago to keep the humans in a prison from which only a few can escape who are brave enough to fight the deadly machines that have taken over the real world. I preferred this one over the two disappointing sequels that followed. Reoladed was okay but could've been better and Revolutions was the worst of the trilogy mainly because the story lost focus on the main characters, the finale felt rushed, and the ending that does leave the door open for another possible sequel was a major letdown. The Matrix however is one of the best sci-fi films out there because of the compelling story, complex characters, a menacing villain, some humor, a little romance, and with just enough intense action. Keanu Reeves stars as Neo the computer hacker who discovers he has a greater destiny than he could have ever imagine. He is the chosen One a man gifted with amazing abilities who may be the only one powerful enough to stop the machines and free his people. Reeves makes for a solid hero who may not win any awards for his performance but he still does a good job in the role. The same can go for Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus a man who believes in The One and wants to free Neo in order to show him the truth about their world. Fishburne is convincing as Morpheus and his fight sequences are impressive especially his sparring match with Reeves. Carrie Anne Moss is believable as the tough freedom fighter Trinity who begins to grow feelings for Neo but she doesn't want to admit it. Moss also does a great job in her fight sequences portraying a woman you definitely wouldn't want to mess with. Hugo Weaving is an imposing villain as Agent Smith a sentinel program who makes it his mission to stop Neo from fulfilling his destiny. Weaving chews the scenery with menace and does a terrific job with his part in the movie. The rest of the supporting cast are admirable in their roles but none of them really stand out. The action\/fight sequences are well executed the ones that left an impression being the first one that opens the movie, the sparring match with Reeves and Fishburne, the lobby shootout, and the fierce showdown between Neo and Agent Smith in a subway. The special effects to create the machines and the ruins of the real world where the machines have taken over which is shown a few times are magnificently done. Also worth mentioning is the music by Don Davis which seems to match perfect whats happening on the screen and the tone of the film. The pacing of the movie was a little slow but once the action kicks into high gear it moves at a steady pace from there. The movie does leave a lot of questions unanswered but other than those few flaws this is still an amazing sci-film that definitely impressed me when I first saw it. So overall The Matrix is a great experience with the state of the art special effects, a compelling story, intense action, suspense, some humor, a little romance, and impressive performances by the cast who make this an enjoyable sci-fi movie to watch.

","genre":"Action, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"11 June 2009","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" The Matrix is an excellent sci-fi adventure with great action from the Wachowski brothers who are admirable in making this movie about a computer hacker who discovers that the world and the life he's been living is an illusion. A computer generated dream world that was created a long time ago to keep the humans in a prison from which only a few can escape who are brave enough to fight the deadly machines that have taken over the real world. I preferred this one over the two disappointing sequels that followed. Reoladed was okay but could've been better and Revolutions was the worst of the trilogy mainly because the story lost focus on the main characters, the finale felt rushed, and the ending that does leave the door open for another possible sequel was a major letdown. The Matrix however is one of the best sci-fi films out there because of the compelling story, complex characters, a menacing villain, some humor, a little romance, and with just enough intense action. Keanu Reeves stars as Neo the computer hacker who discovers he has a greater destiny than he could have ever imagine. He is the chosen One a man gifted with amazing abilities who may be the only one powerful enough to stop the machines and free his people. Reeves makes for a solid hero who may not win any awards for his performance but he still does a good job in the role. The same can go for Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus a man who believes in The One and wants to free Neo in order to show him the truth about their world. Fishburne is convincing as Morpheus and his fight sequences are impressive especially his sparring match with Reeves. Carrie Anne Moss is believable as the tough freedom fighter Trinity who begins to grow feelings for Neo but she doesn't want to admit it. Moss also does a great job in her fight sequences portraying a woman you definitely wouldn't want to mess with. Hugo Weaving is an imposing villain as Agent Smith a sentinel program who makes it his mission to stop Neo from fulfilling his destiny. Weaving chews the scenery with menace and does a terrific job with his part in the movie. The rest of the supporting cast are admirable in their roles but none of them really stand out. The action\/fight sequences are well executed the ones that left an impression being the first one that opens the movie, the sparring match with Reeves and Fishburne, the lobby shootout, and the fierce showdown between Neo and Agent Smith in a subway. The special effects to create the machines and the ruins of the real world where the machines have taken over which is shown a few times are magnificently done. Also worth mentioning is the music by Don Davis which seems to match perfect whats happening on the screen and the tone of the film. The pacing of the movie was a little slow but once the action kicks into high gear it moves at a steady pace from there. The movie does leave a lot of questions unanswered but other than those few flaws this is still an amazing sci-film that definitely impressed me when I first saw it. So overall The Matrix is a great experience with the state of the art special effects, a compelling story, intense action, suspense, some humor, a little romance, and impressive performances by the cast who make this an enjoyable sci-fi movie to watch.

Although it seems impossible now, there was a time when Pixar hinged on the brink of bankruptcy on a daily basis. And the idea of creating a fully, computer animated feature film seemed a far off, distant fantasy.After producing several highly acclaimed short films, Pixar's dream of making a full proper feature came to fruition when they entered into a partnership with Disney that still continues today. Thanks to some generous investors, a real team effort and a wing and a prayer, Pixar got the go-ahead on their debut feature, Toy Story.Toy Story is where the Pixar legacy begins. It was the first of its kind. And a huge success. Despite all of the doubts and preconceptions, they had pulled it out of the bag and Pixar's name was made. They created an entire revolution in animation. One that had never been seen before.But it took a lot to go through to get there. Toy Story had a tumultuous history before it even made it to the big screen. According to the excellent documentary The Pixar Story, the script went through numerous rewrites. Particularly with Woody's character. In Pixar's own words, Woody was becoming the most repellent thing you've ever seen. The film just wasn't working. It was cynical. Sarcastic. It wasn't funny at all. And it wasn't the film John Lasseter imagined when he originated it.With all that in mind, its all the more surprising how good it turned out to be. Toy Story has all of the qualities we've come to expect from the best of Pixar's work. Its confident. Its witty. It moves at a gallop and its intelligent too. Its one thing to make a whole new kind of film. Its another to make it work well.The plot is a quite familiar one. Toys that come to life when no-one's around. But Pixar put some fascinating spins on that one sentence synopsis thanks to some well etched characters, a great team of writers, a charming musical score and fluid animation. Woody and Buzz Lightyear have become two of Pixar's most beloved creations. With Woody being such a jerk in the early days of Toy Story's conception, it may explain why Pixar brought in Hollywood's Nicest Guy Tom Hanks to voice him.Some of Woody's character flaws have still made it into the film. But that may be one of the reasons why people were so drawn to it. Because he's not so squeaky clean compared to Disney's heroes. A pull-string cowboy doll, the king of his mountain. And when his owner, Andy gets Buzz Lightyear, a space ranger action figure, and winds up cast aside, he goes mad with envy. He's as flawed as any flesh and blood person. A little selfish too. But not so much that he's irredeemable (which he almost wound up being in the early drafts).But Buzz Lightyear is an even better character. He's a true original. Because unlike all the other toys around him, he doesn't know he is one. He believes he's a real space ranger. And the film is clever the way it wittily plays into Buzz's delusions about himself. He's so convinced of what he is that its a genuinely crushing moment when he finds out the truth (a nicely played scene when Buzz watches a Buzz Lightyear TV commercial).Pixar always have a knack for matching the right actors to their characters. And Tim Allen is a perfect Buzz Lightyear. He captures the right amount of cocky bravado and self-righteous intent that the character so desperately needs to endear. Unlike all the other companies quick to jump on the CGI animation bandwagon, Pixar don't pick big name actors to ensure box-office success. They choose the right people to bring their characters to life.The animation in Toy Story could seem primitive now when compared to the dazzling backdrops of Finding Nemo or Wall-E. The backgrounds are not as detailed and even the climax is not that lavish (Pixar didn't yet have a limitless budget to command) but they don't really need to be because its story is enough of a hook to enthrall us. One thing they could have done without though is showing us the faces of the human characters. They tend to look too unreal when computer animated. Pixar hadn't quite got the hang yet of making a human face look natural. Not until The Incredibles anyway.These are only minor quibbles. In all other regards, Toy Story is a delight. Even at this early stage, Pixar has the formula down perfect that gets them through each and every one of their films. Great characters. Shrewd intelligence. Genuine heart. And a real sense of fun and adventure. Toy Story 2 is even better. It ups all the good things about this by a quantum factor. A great start for a superb studio.To Infinity and Beyond!

Some scenes are better than others, but overall, Wolf is too torpid to be a good movie.From the start Jack Nicholson feels out of place, but he is not at his worst. He plays Will Randall, an aging editor close to retirement (or loosing his job) Driving home one night, he hits a wolf in the middle of the road and when he goes to inspect, he is bitten. Suddenly his life is a lot less dull, as his senses become super strong, he begins to flourish once again in work, and he develops a relationship with his boss' daughter Laura . But her life is put in jeopardy when she is forced to hide him from the police and finds herself stalked by Randall's young ambitious colleague (and rival), who has been bitten himself and subsequently has become wolf. The role of Randall requires much emotion to be convincing, and Nicholson doesn't have it. He does not even look good as a wolf.

","genre":"Romance, Drama"},{"date":"11 June 2009","score":"","review":" Director David Fincher entered the world of directing on the heels of one of the most classic American Sci-Fi franchises of all time, the Alien series. He followed James Cameron's classic Aliens with the not quite as critically acclaimed Alien 3. However, he has since shown us that he can indeed compete with the likes of Cameron and other A-list directors. He is most widely known for the immense cult classic Fight Club and Oscar monster The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, but his first stand-alone film after Alien 3 was the brilliant and classy crime thriller Seven. This film proves that right from the start Fincher was a force to be reckoned with. This of course isn't to underplay the excellence of the screenwriter, Andrew Kevin Walker, or the intense and spine-tingling score by Howard Shore, or the excellent performances by all actors, including the actor who plays the killer (as the actor was kept under wraps during the marketing for this film, and isn't in the credits until the very end, i won't reveal who it is but it's one of my person favorites). This movie is a prime example of all elements of great film-making coming together to make something that is simply beautiful.Probably the strongest element of this film is the way it unfolds. Seven is a master class in story-telling. The plot is handled with care and expertise. Fincher knows just the right times to be subtle, and make you really pay attention to catch everything, and then when to throw something directly in your face. While the film tells the story of probably one of the most sadistic and disturbing serial killers of all time, none of the killings are actually shown on screen. Instead, the film crew used other means of conveying the gruesome details, things like dialogue and pictures.

He followed James Cameron's classic Aliens with the not quite as critically acclaimed Alien 3. However, he has since shown us that he can indeed compete with the likes of Cameron and other A-list directors. He is most widely known for the immense cult classic Fight Club and Oscar monster The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, but his first stand-alone film after Alien 3 was the brilliant and classy crime thriller Seven. This film proves that right from the start Fincher was a force to be reckoned with. This of course isn't to underplay the excellence of the screenwriter, Andrew Kevin Walker, or the intense and spine-tingling score by Howard Shore, or the excellent performances by all actors, including the actor who plays the killer (as the actor was kept under wraps during the marketing for this film, and isn't in the credits until the very end, i won't reveal who it is but it's one of my person favorites). This movie is a prime example of all elements of great film-making coming together to make something that is simply beautiful.Probably the strongest element of this film is the way it unfolds. Seven is a master class in story-telling. The plot is handled with care and expertise. Fincher knows just the right times to be subtle, and make you really pay attention to catch everything, and then when to throw something directly in your face. While the film tells the story of probably one of the most sadistic and disturbing serial killers of all time, none of the killings are actually shown on screen.

I kid you not, watching these people dance all over the screen made me want to die. I'm sorry but musicals just are not my thing. Especially one that dates back to the 50's.West Side Story is a story about two rival gangs that want to take over the block. One is a white gang, and one is a Puerto Rican gang. Clearly tempers fly and the go after each other on a daily basis. Finally one day the two leaders of the gangs decide to meet up and organize one major brawl to settle the scores once and for all. Just before the great fight, something unheard of occurs. The right had man from the white gang and the little sister of the leader of the Rican gang fall in love. Something like Romeo and Juliet but instead of rival families, its rival gangs. Could their love be strong enough to withstand the pressure they get from their piers? Me personally I could do without this movie. I really can't enjoy people singing and dancing all over the television for two hours. There were some high points to the movie though. I must admit, the character Maria was very attractive. Watching her made the movie almost worth watching. There was much more bad than good when it came to this movie. The choreography was awful. The moves were not tight and the background dancers were not in sync with each other. I thought the singing was bad also. Vocal coaches were needed to improve the singing big time.Just knowing that this movie was shot back in the 1950's put it in my head to not get my hopes up. The stages were very fake to me. The fact that I grew up watching these modern day films makes it hard for me to take steps backward and enjoy old style films. On top of that I really don't like musicals. I would rather sit through romantic, chick flicks and day. Maybe the next viewer will have more appreciation for this movie but as for me, I rather go without hearing this West Side Story.

Who else but them could come up with a name like Godzilla. It's good that the Americans decided to keep this name rather than choose their own- it probably would have ended up being called Josh, or Todd, or The Big Dinosaur From Somewhere Unknown! The only other similarity is that Godzilla still loves to stomp around cities crushing buildings and eating puny earthlings. The bigger the building the better- The Empire State Building must be worth at least 200,000 points alone. Not to mention the mono rail and the chewitts bonus received when lifting trains off the tracks.The story goes America has been experimenting with nukes in a sea far away. The creatures in the sea and on land are affected and mutated. Skip forward fiddy years and a huge earthquake has ripped through the ocean floor somewhere in the Bermuda Triangle. A bunch of scientists go out to investigate the strange aftershock readings and find some bewildering things, such as giant footprints. It soon becomes apparent that the quake has awoken a giant dinosaur which was created by the nukes years before. The dinosaur is angry and wants to destroy mankind! It is swimming to the nearest city and so begins a race for the scientists to prepare the city for attack, but who would believe a story about a giant monster? Of course Zilla arrives and begins punching, kicking, and chowing its way through London with relish. The effects are something truly special. It feels like you are really there, running between taxis, feeling the rumbles of the monsters footsteps. You look up, way up and see its massive jaws towering far above- it must be as big as 3 men! There is much action, excitement, and funny, and some scary parts. Baby Godzillas chase hapless fools through a hotel and into the sewers. We turn to night vision and don't see much; all we hear is some odd screechy noises. When the characters turn they see they are being followed by lots of yellow eyes in the darkness and so begins a terrifying chase through the London Subway. One girl gets bitten and subsequently explodes from her wounds. Meanwhile the Big Daddy climbs the London Eye to get away from all the helichopters shooting at it, but nothing seems to stop it.This is vastly superior to the original Black and White films. Firstly it's in colour so it's more believable. Secondly, they try to make you feel sorry for G'Z'A in the original, but here he's just a big nasty brute who must be destroyed. Let me ask you- if you were being chased by a monster, would you turn round and ask it why it was so angry, and if it's mother never hugged it? No! You would kick it in the gunells and be gone! If this film had been made before the originals then it would be held in higher regard than those ones, but unfortunately they got there first. I don't know who starred in this movie, but I think Geoff Goldbum was there and Matthew Modine.Best Scene The tension between the boss of the scientists and the army boss is great throughout. The quote I'm running this Monkey Farm now, Frankenstein! is the highlight, just before Godzilla jumps in the window and pulls his legs off.

Just like everything else, even the Alien has a strong veil of mystery.

A brilliant idea, truly, because it ensures people would go to the sequel, be it good or bad (And in this case, REALLY good, but you already knew that P). Then there's the way the alien acts.

I read a review somewhere that the time line of the movie jumped all over the place and all I have to say to that person is If you couldn't follow the time line of the movie, you must have forgotten to pause the movie when you took a bathroom break.At a glance, one might be confused as to how the scenes of the movie line up, unless you pay attention from the beginning (and learn to love your pause button). The whole premise of the movie is that the old man (Coleman) is trying to discover a way (through meditation) to enter the dream world CONSIOUSLY and thus live forever in this state with the woman that he loves.He experiments with meditation and because of an accident that happened in his yard during the experiment, his soul jumped into a young mans body and the soul of his wife, who is not as into the experiment as him, only partially jumps into the body of that young mans love interest. (His best friend's girl) It is a heart wrenching, yet simultaneously heart warming story about soul mates and the unbreakable bond that will always lead them back to each others arms, and hearts.Many of Corey Feldman's dance moves mimicked Michael Jackson. This was intentional due to the popularity of Michael Jackson in the late 80's. True to the era, Bobby was a young teenager who emulated a very popular icon of the times. Never-The-Less, as an adult, I still find his in this movie charming, witty, and full of depth.Anyone who would say that this man made his success on his looks alone has obviously not seen this movie. It is rare to find a good looking actor who also has a full arsenal of talent and is not afraid to use it. If more performers would fore-go work that is trendy and opt for jobs that require real skills; movies, TV shows, and music would be so much the better for it.

Maybe the movie offends my moral sense and therefore I cannot like it without subjecting my soul to hell.Or maybe, I cannot put myself in the context of the time the film was made. Sure, the phrase 'I'll make him an offer he can't refuse!' is trite today. But it wasn't when the movie was made! Although the Mafia was not a new concept to most people, the idea that crime families lived like normal people was a revelation, taken one step further with 'The Sopranos.' Similarly, one cannot compare 'The Sands of Iwo Jima'with 'Saving Private Ryan.' Although both had good production values of their times, the technology of the 90's made Ryan seem to be a better picture. To summarize, before you consider yourself another Roger Ebert, read the reviews of the people who liked the movie and try to understand what they saw and why you did not fully appreciate it. Then, sit down at your computer and type, without ranting, a well reasoned critique that may be of use to others.

Granted, there are several cheap scares, the oh it was just the cat kind of thing, however, there certainly are more substantial ones herein, as well. The mood and atmosphere are very skillfully built up, and last successfully almost the entirety of this. Sadly, this does run a tad longer than it ought to... and to facilitate that, it employs an unsatisfying red herring that gets too generous an amount of time spent on it. I would also go so far as to claim the twist to be... I don't know, unnecessary? It worked, I'll give them that. The plot is fairly well-written and tends to develop well. Acting in this is quite magnificent. The cinematography and editing are excellent. There is a little language in this, sexuality is mainly hinted at or mentioned in dialog, and violence is relatively bloodless.
