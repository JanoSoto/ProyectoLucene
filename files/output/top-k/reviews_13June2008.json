A serene smile on his face, Murphy spouts platitudes such as You need to find ultimate and complete happiness. Not only does Holy Man register as a lukewarm New Age romantic comedy, but it also neglects to exploit Murphy for maximum mirth. Although billed as the title character, Murphy spends more time off screen. Sadly, Holy Man waits far too long to integrate the Eddie Murphy character into the action. Worst, Mr. Holland's Opus director Stephen Herek's film crackles with pretense more often than humor.Holy Man focuses on self-absorbed TV executive Ricky Hayman (Jeff Goldblum of Jurassic Park) whose career at the Miami-based Good Buy Shopping Network is in the crapper. When his new boss, Mr. Bainbridge (a deeply tanned Robert Loggia), delivers an ultimatum, Ricky finds his work cut out for him. If network profits don't pick up in 14 days, Ricky is history. Adding insult to injury, Bainbridge hires sassy media analyst Kate Newell (Kelly Preston of Twins) to help Ricky devise a distinctive network image. At first, Ricky and Kate hate each other. Eventually, they wind up in each other's arms. Breezing down the freeway one day, Ricky's Jaguar blows a tire. Accident and coincidence serve to bring Ricky, Kate, and G together. On a footloose pilgrimage through Miami, G takes the time to kneel and smell the grass. Crossing the rush hour freeway with no thought for his own safety, G offers to help Ricky and Kate. G captivates Kate with his cordiality. As Ricky is about to drive off, he puts his Jaguar in reverse and nearly backs over the pilgrim. G faints, and Ricky and Kate rush him to the hospital.Kate invites G to her home to recover. Ricky insists that G bunk with him. G turns Ricky onto herbal teas and meditation. Ricky's low opinion of G does a 180 when G crashes one of Ricky's parties. G uses hypnosis to cure a wealthy party guest who fears flying. Ricky makes a deal with G that sends him before the cameras. G pokes fund at the crass hucksterism of Ricky's cheapskate products. GBSN's ratings soar, and G becomes an overnight sensation. Eventually, a guilt-ridden Kate convinces Ricky that they have no right to ruin G's life with fame and fortune. Driving back to where they met him on the freeway, Ricky and Kate bid G adieu. Nothing miraculous or hilarious enlivens Oscar winning Dead Poets Society scenarist Tom Schulman's sluggish, pseudo-inspirational screenplay. The premise is that (1) shopping and (2) watching TV are the two key experiences that Americans pursue with religious fanaticism. Herek and Schulman obsess over plot logistics instead of forging funny situations.As a comedy, Holy Man springs jokes and gags that garnish rather than galvanize the plot. Murphy doesn't appear until nearly twenty minutes or more have elapsed. When G should be front and center for laughs, the filmmakers cut back to Ricky and Kate's banal love story and leaves little time for Murphy. Basically, Holy Man doesn't have a prayer, but Eddie Murphy deserves credit for trying something new. The magnetism that G displays comes primarily from Murphy's smirking but subdued performance as a neutered but nice guy. Aside from his on-camera antics during a 'live' taping session in the GBSN studio, Murphy never breaks character to share in the laughter. Lanky Jeff Goldblum milks soulless Ricky Hayman for everything that he can. Goldblum is one of those rare thespians who can make gabby stretches of expository dialogue sound fascinating when it is clear that all he is doing is juggling literary baloney. Kelly Preston furnishes the obligatory sex appeal. Several real-life star, such as Soupy Sales, Betty White, Florence Henderson, and James Brown, show up in celebrity cameos as sponsors for phony products.

It has some of the worst dialog in the movie I have ever heard, and Connie Nielsen's acting just made me want to throw up. Not to mention the abysmal plot where there are several problems 1) We're made to think that Commodus is a bad emperor mainly because he killed his dad and wanted to sleep with his sister. 1st thing wrong about this is that wanting to get laid with his sister doesn't have anything to do with being a bad emperor. 2nd thing is if I was in Commodus's situation, I would have killed him too for not letting me be emperor for some stupid general played by Russell Crowe.2) The general won a couple fights and suddenly he's everyone's favorite action hero.3) It's the same tired old revenge plot we've been seeing in movies for years with nothing added to make it interesting (see Kill Bill for that). Also so what that he killed his wife and son too; it's better to get them out of the way then to have them coming for revenge after killing dear old dad (although they probably wouldn't have done much), and they were not even in the movie, so I really didn't care (see Star Wars for caring that family members die).4) Problem 3 led me here about how in movies they always leave the main character alone in an easy situation he can get out of instead of just killing the loser while he's being held. (see Austin Powers for making fun of this Hollywood trend)5) The emperor would never get in a ring to fight a slave, especially when he knows he's gonna lose. How stupid!

Minutes later, we see Paul Kersey's family destroyed by examples of these poor, underprivileged souls.

Not popular on its initial release &#150; being blocked by other summer films of 1986 such as ALIENS &#150; it has since developed a following which it most certainly deserves. John Carpenter purposely made this a B-movie and I commend him for that, because it certainly is a blast and the chemistry between characters with Kurt Russell at the center is mostly entertaining.The plot revolves around an ancient feud between two separate Chinese groups that has come all the way from its homeland to San Francisco which witless, wisecracking trucker Jack Burton (the always amusing Kurt Russell) suddenly finds himself right in the middle of. With his friend Wang Chi &#150; a skilled Chinese martial artist who owns a restraint in Little China &#150; he is pulled into a fight between good and evil and to save his truck! An ancient sorcerer &#150; Lo Pan &#150; needs to marry a girl with green eyes and then sacrifice her to lift a curse and retain his young form, or else be a frail old man for centuries to come; only being able to take his true form for brief periods of time. When Wang Chi's fiancée is abducted by Lo Pan's Three Storms &#150; warriors possessing the powers of a storm &#150; it is up to Jack and Wang to save her and end the centuries old conflict.As I previously mentioned this film was intentionally made a B-movie and the cast obviously had a lot of fun making it, with lots of tongue in cheek dialogue and intentional mistakes. It all adds to the campy fun that is Big Trouble in little China Town. The best part about it comes from the chemistry between Jack Burton and Wang Chi. You'd think Russell's character would be on top of things being the muscled American toting the gun, but Chi is the real hero with all his martial arts and fighting skills, but Burton never seems to get that constantly puffing his chest believing he is in fact the hero and Chi is the sidekick.

When finally seen, it goes past the hype of being one of those sleeper hits of the 1970s. It's mostly a pure masterpiece of animation, British or otherwise, though for Britain it's an even more significant achievement if only because only a handful of movies made there have made it to the States (not counting Rankin\/Bass stuff like the Hobbit, more like the 1950s Animal Farm adaptation).The approach from writer\/director\/producer Martin Rosen recognizes the source material as something very special; it's very much like one of those memorable books translated to screen without compromise that speaks to either very sophisticated older kids or to open-minded adults. It's not a fun romp, but rather a drama about society broken down to pieces and the contention between those that want to break from the old ways and destruction from human hands and those that still c ling to the ways of the 'General' character. It's also not for those not ready for a sad story; while it doesn't quite end on a sad note (maybe more bittersweet with a touch of the spiritual in a sense), there's lots of struggle and adversity to face, and it even faces questions that probably mean more coming out of an English mind-set regarding the breaking out of the old guard in times of survival.Basically, it's about two rabbits, Hazel and Fiver, who lead a group of rabbits from their old homestead to a place that will be safe from destruction. And it's a good idea as all the old burrows and tunnels are plugged up. But there's contention in the ranks from the 'General', who demands that everything stay the same. Thanks to rabbits like Bigwig though things move ahead, but there's a lot of obstacles along the way. This is the clothesline of the plot, and there are a lot of details that should feel like they're apart of a more conventional animated movie even out of Disney. And yet, with Rosen's direction and the work of the animators, it's by a different impulse and mood, the film has the look of a *real* artistic drive- colors are usually (with a couple of exceptions like with that odd sun) very naturalistic, as most of the rabbits are, and because of this there's something going on one doesn't usually see in animated talking animal movies a sense of the world presented as realistically (or at least honestly) as possible, and then pulsating with humanistic qualities through the characters and their journey.As I mentioned, it's not really for little kids. If only because some of them will just be confused at times or not understand why the rabbits aren't like the really cute ones of other storybooks and fantasies (or, actually, just parts of the storyline and really well written dialog), but also because of the violence- the kind of which that could've inspired the PG-13 rating system back in the day. This goes without saying occasionally Rosen tries to put in some things that could make it more family friendly, and these end up being the only liabilities of the movie, notably, for me, the Art Garfunkel song put into a scene midway through (not to say too much but it involves a ghost) that feels sappy as bad syrup. When Rosen sticks to his guns and makes it a solid, unflinching story of rabbits out for survival in not-so-merry old England, it's exceptional, and surely one of the best films of the late 70s.

Technically it is one of the most well-crafted movies ever made with brilliant direction, superb acting, bravura cinematography and terrific editing. Music by the Dust Brothers maintains the overall surreal ambiance of the passages to which they are set (see the scoring of the segment where the Fight Clubbers try to pick fights with innocent people for a good example) and the writing and characterization are far more insightful than the average shocker. Every character is developed well enough for us to either identify with them or at least understand them. There is a lot of unusually ingenious creativity evident in certain scenes such as the IKEA catalog scene, the opening zoom through a brain sequence, the support group scenes, the use of a subjective voice over and non linear chronology.That's where the pluses end. Now for the minuses. The movie depicts men in their 20s and 30s who regain their masculinity by beating up\/getting beaten up by other men. Once they regain their masculinity, they rebel against society by destroying the capitalistic \/consumeristic society that has enslaved them for so long. That entails carrying out destructive and loathsome acts of vandalism against society. If you want to re attain your masculinity even if it means killing yourself, then go hurt yourself. Why terrorize innocent people in society who don't share your concerns and probably wont feel the same way you do? Splicing porn stills into children's films and spiking food with bodily fluids might seem downright funny to some, but it is simply vile, repellent and morally repugnant. Some people will even find making soap out of human fat positively revolting. Yet the cleverness with which all this is lensed will make some people want to imitate some of these pranks.Many of the dangerous ideas may actually sound deep and thought-provoking but some of them are just inversions of the Truth. For instance, all true Christians know that our corporate, materialistic world sells us a lie when it says we need our favorite McDonald meal to be happy or we aren't somebody if we don't have a good bank balance or the latest car. Fight Club knows this truth and perverts it. It also perverts the beautiful ideal of masculinity suggesting that if you do not have scars or injuries from dangerous beatings, you are not man enough. At least movies like Die Hard and the LOTR series celebrated masculinity in the proper moral context, with the protagonists flexing their muscles to protect and defend innocent people.An argument could be successfully constructed that this movie doesn't glorify its violence and nihilism rather it is a deconstruction of it as evidenced by the hero's futile attempts near the end to stop the mass destruction from taking place. The subtlety of the movie's last-act rebuttal to its anarchistic themes completely escaped me as I felt that this movie was nothing more than an apologetic for its one evil character's nihilistic philosophies.The eerily prescient image of the credit card buildings collapsing serves as a tight ruler slap to the wrists of all those who cheered during the destruction scenes of Independence Day and Armageddon. I never cheered during all those pyrotechnics so clearly I am not among the members of the audience this sharp satirical barb is aimed at. I am looking for the movie or movies that correctly satirize capitalism, materialism and the feminization of masculinity in developed societies, but Fight Club is not that film.

When he inevitably breaks free, government researcher Rowan (Alexa Doig) lures the lumbering maniac into a cryogenic chamber where they are both frozen for 400 years, until the crew of a spacecraft visiting the now desolate planet Earth discovers their perfectly preserved bodies and thaws them out...Up to this point, mass murderer Jason Vorhees has been drowned, macheted, axed, buried, reanimated, melted, blown to pieces, and dragged to Hell. Knowing full well that any attempt at making the next chapter in the Friday the 13th franchise in any way scary or believable would be a futile exercise, the film's makers took the only route left to them they made Jason X a gloriously silly and tongue-in-cheek popcorn flick, full of creative deaths, gung-ho action, and flashy special effects. The result is a film totally unlike any other in the series, and one that will appeal to fans who enjoy a large helping of cheese with their horror.Featuring several smokin' hot women, a sexy android, virtual reality monsters, a team of marines with big guns, nanobots that can mend almost any injury, and, ultimately, the introduction of a new improved cyborg Jason, this film is an intentionally funny piece of mindless entertainment, and I loved it.But don't go thinking that, because this one ain't taking things seriously any more, it wimps out on the gore, 'cos it doesn't the violence is as frequent and as bloody as always, and also very imaginative, with one kill in particular ranking amongst the best of the entire series a sexy scientist gets her face plunged into liquid nitrogen and then smashed into small pieces on a work surface, leaving a red crystalline crater in her head.After much death and mayhem, an exciting finale sees Jason go head-to-head with the android (kitted up in PVC and wielding two high-powered hand cannons), revisit a virtual Camp Crystal Lake to slaughter a couple of topless bimbos, and, after escaping an explosion in space, burn up as he enters the atmosphere of Earth 2.

No, The World is not Enough is not the last all-out action Bond movie, but notice I said the last GOOD one, which is true, because by all accounts Die Another Day was terrible. The second question many will ask also deals with said term, but 007's most recent outing (that has been released), Casino Royale was good, but not an all-out action extravaganza.Given the popularity of the dashing secret agent's movies, I'll assume that most people have already seen the film, and will therefore skip the synopsis. If, by some act of who knows what, you are reading this review without having seen the movie, drop everything and see it. It's not that I'm going to write any spoilers, it's just that to not see this movie is to deny one's self a lot of brain-candy pleasure.Once again, Pierce Brosnan is James Bond, charming with an almost invincibility and an insatiable desire to woo beautiful women. For his third outing as the guy in the black tux, Brosnan hasn't worn out his welcome. Robert Carlyle creates a suitable villain, and though while not the creepiest of Brosnan's nemeses as Bond (that would be Sean Bean from Brosnan's first outing as 007), Carlyle chews the scenery well and does what he is required of him. Less impressive is Denise Richards as one of the two beauties that grace the screen (that actually play major roles). She does what she's supposed to, but for the most part, she's rather flat (though her first scene was great). It's also nice to see Judi Dench and Robbie Coltrane again, and Samantha Bond is delightful in her short scenes as Bond's female counterpart, Miss Moneypenny.Where have you gone, Sophie Marceau? Carlyle may be the main villain in The World is Not Enough, but the most villainous and most interesting character is Marceau's Elektra King. She sinks her teeth into the role, and demands our attention fully whenever she's on screen alone, and shares it equally with Brosnan whenever she is on screen with him. Marceau is a talented actress, and should be in more American movies. Judging by Hollywood's fickleness with new actors, her appearance in Rob Reiner's monstrosity Alex and Emma has thus far destroyed her chances of being in more American movies. That can't be blamed on her, with all of its star power her opportunity to be in it was probably too good to pass up.The World is Not Enough is a great James Bond adventure, and is definitely worth more than a few watches by any action movie fan.

When something this enervated gets made and discussed seriously, you want to laugh. But you're too aghast to do that, so you just keep watching. If Kubrick wanted to blow the lid off of sex, he's about forty years late. If he wanted to shock you with the idea that women love sex and fantasize about it, then again, I feel that he must have been locked in an emotional prison the last few decades. As with Full Metal Jacket, the ideas and themes are woefully out of date and overdone by the time Kubrick gets to them. Have you ever seen a movie about sex that showed it so clinically? And for god's sakes, it's supposed to be about a sex club, where is the heat. And then there they are just sparks from earlier movies. When Cruise goes to buy his costume, the shop's daughter is a flirty tease, a new Lolita? It's a yawn. And what of the casting of Cruise and Kidman. Did it add the personal touch that Kubrick was hoping for? I don't think so, because Kidman's character is so brittle and shrill and Cruise is down in the dumps. These two may not sex, but they certainly need some yoga. And if you take it, as some have written here, as some great work of art, what the hell what would you take from that? That sex is universal? That you should never go to a sex club unprepared? There are many moments when laughter is induced due to Kubrick's arch staging. My favorite is when Cruise is constantly being warned that he's in danger. Of course, since both he and the girl warning him, are wearing masks, you don't really catch much emotional weight.

The movie is definitely so bad that it'll make your eyes roll but the half-baked editing of Bela Lugosi's pre-mortem performance should at least bust a few giggles out of the viewer.What the movie lacks the most is credibility and that simultaneously is the reason why the film doesn't work as a science fiction film nor does it really work as an unintentional comedy. Though there are some things about this movie that make you laugh, the final half is utterly dull with a story-line that could have had potential being wasted with low-grade special effects and hammy acting. From this point the film sort of resembles Uwe Boll's infamous 'Alone in the Dark'.The rushed production shows in every singles scene. Actors struggle to remember their lines and to deliver them, especially Tor Johnson, but the continuity errors and cheap sets only work to enhance the experience. The film is actually rather hilarious to watch for the first 30 minutes or so, but after that the joke becomes old and we're left with a movie that just isn't competent on any level.An E for Effort and for comedy value but generally speaking Plan 9 has very few redeeming values.

But that frail, old woman saved her son with strength she didn't know she had &#150; until she needed it. Call it an adrenalin rush, call it what you will, but it happened.So, desperate situations do bring about desperate measures by people who don't appear to have the strength or will to accomplish a seemingly impossible feat. Until they're forced into action...At that level and that level alone, Unbreakable could have been a great movie, I think. But, because it skates on the edge of the paranormal, it loses some impact for me. Nevertheless, it's an excellent story, well acted and exquisitely directed by M. Night Shyamalan, famous for The Sixth Sense (1999).Don't get me wrong, however I'm open to the concept of the paranormal because I've experienced things that can't be explained by rational means or knowledge. You may have also.This isn't the first film, however, to explore the idea of the super-man (let's put aside all comic book stuff, despite the heavy influence of comic books in Unbreakable) in 1968, a Frank M. Robinson novel, called The Power, was put to a film of the same name. It was heavily criticized, and yet it was a well produced rendition of an excellent sci-fi story about an evil man with super, paranormal powers who stumbles upon a good man with identical powers. The ensuing battle for supremacy between the two made for great entertainment. And, as in Unbreakable, you don't know the identity of the evil man until close to the end. The key point with The Power, however, is that the good man didn't know he had the power &#150; until he was tested to the point of death. And the twist at the end was irony at its best...Unbreakable takes up that idea of the super-man, where David Dunn (Bruce Willis), through a complex series of connected events, finally comes to realize that he is much more than other mortals.David is a security guard at a local university; but he used to be the brightest prospect in American football. Unhappily, he has a marriage that's all but dead done in by years of sadness, discomfort, distrust and doubt. He is consumed with sadness, and not only because Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson), a comic book aficionado and art gallery owner, tells him that the saddest people are those who don't know why they're on this earth...Indeed, the happiest person is the one who knows his\/her destiny, the reason for being. Hence slowly, but inexorably, David comes to the realization that his purpose on earth is to provide security for the oppressed, to help those who cannot help themselves, and to stop the path of evil, wherever and whenever. Thus emerges the closest yet to a modern-day superhero.As you will see, it's an unwelcome realization for David, at first. But he finally grasps that he is the defender of good; moreover, he discovers he has the strength and power to do it. And, in the climactic confrontation with a diabolical home invader, David proves it &#150; to himself and to others. That knowledge for David has a price, however Good can only exist &#150; can only make sense &#150; when Evil exists as a co-partner. And, therein lies the greatest irony for poor David.I loved this movie. It appeals to the heroic in all of us. It shows that evil can be countered effectively &#150; and without the need for questionable vigilante exploits. Implicitly also, it suggests that the heroic is potentially within all of us, even the least because, given the right conditions, we could all be a 'frail, old woman' trying to save a son, a daughter or anybody from harm.The cinematography and editing are excellent. Bruce Willis gives one of his best performances, I think, equal to or better than In Country (1989); Robin Wright Penn, as Audrey, is suitably distraught and uncertain as his doubting wife; Spencer Clark, as David's son, Joseph, is a standout and very professional young actor. And what more needs to be said about Samuel L. Jackson &#150; only that he is one of the most powerful actors ever to grace the silver screen.So, forget about any narrative holes you might see and the fact that the story moves very slowly. The tension and mystery mount inexorably, however. So, treat yourself and your family to a thoroughly enjoyable 106 minutes.

Not only does it fail to be as fascinating as the original, but it also fares worst as a sequel. Instead of intentionally thrilling us with insights about good and evil, The Heretic unintentionally spends more time making us laugh as its silliness. This is a shame when you consider the enormous talents squandered in Warner Brothers' production of this 118 minute monstrosity.Director John Boorman delivers little more than first-rate production values, including many cinematic innovations, which were squandered along with the talent in this $12.5 million stinker. The plot deals with Regan MacNeil (Linda Blair of The Exorcist) four years after undergoing therapy with a shrink, Dr. Gene Tuskin (Louise Fletcher of Russian Roulette) who uses a device which enables her to penetrate Regan's mind and determine if there are any scars left from the exorcism. Meanwhile, understandably disturbed by the death of the priest who exorcised Regan earlier, the Vatican dispatches Father Lamont (a lamenting Richard Burton of Where Eagles Dare) to investigate the circumstances of the death of Father Merrin (Max Von Sydow). At first, because he feels unqualified, Lamont is reluctant. When he meets Regan, however, and confronts a vision of Evil, the challenge to pursue Evil to its source, to destroy it, and to purge himself as well as Regan obsesses him.In the screenplay by Generation scenarist William Goodhart, Father Lamont heads to Africa in search of the source of the Evil which Regan identifies as the Demon Pazuzu. What a name! After a tense build-up, you'd expect Boorman and company would offer us more than an ugly looking locust. That's right! The villain in The Exorcist 2 The Heretic turns out to be a dumb old grasshopper, and from the moment that you see this one grasshopper you know he's a fake and you want to laugh insanely out loud. The Exorcist 2 The Heretic emerges as a comedy of errors, complete with a tap-dancing musical interlude. Reportedly, Boorman re-edited the picture at least twice, but nothing could have saved this turkey.The problem with The Exorcist 2 The Heretic is that Boorman, Goodhart, and uncredited scenarist Rospo Pallenberg&#151;he adapted Excalibur never developed the suspense and therefore cannot involve audiences in this lifeless epic. Consequently, the film grinds on like it will never end, and then ends abruptly and unconvincingly. Along the way, Boorman drags in a scientific method to control Evil, while he uses a lot of leftover film footage from Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom. Moreover, Boorman rarely brings in that nasty little which from the original, but when he does, she speaks so lady-like that you wonder if The Exorcist 2 The Heretic is an in-name only follow-up film. When he set out to helm this superficial, second-rate horror yarn, Boorman promised that he would not stoop to the vulgar tactics of the original Where The Exorcist was a negative and debasing experience, Boorman sought to make The Heretic into a redemptive and thought-provoking sequel. Clearly, Boorman wasn't the ideal choice as director. And in his effort to make a meaningful film out of what was to be remake of The Exorcist, Boorman has sunken even lower with a film that vomits claptrap philosophy, wastes a sterling cast, and teases its audience with never-to-be delivered horrors.

Clearly, Boorman wasn't the ideal choice as director. And in his effort to make a meaningful film out of what was to be remake of The Exorcist, Boorman has sunken even lower with a film that vomits claptrap philosophy, wastes a sterling cast, and teases its audience with never-to-be delivered horrors.

Nick Mancuso was more believable as a rural Southwestern sheriff. Lou Diamond Phillips is usually good, he just seemed like his heart was not in this movie.
