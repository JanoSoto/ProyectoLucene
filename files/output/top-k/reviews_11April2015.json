It didn't need to be a commercial hit to be recognized as one of the best movies in the 90's and probably in history. The performances of Brad Pitt and Edward Norton in this movie are so far the best of their acting careers. The strong messages against consumerism are the best of the film. You're not your job We buy thing we don't need, with money we don't have to impress people we don't like are only a few of Tyler's quotes. The fact that you have to pay attention to understand what's going on is another reason this movie is so great. If yo expect tons of special effects and no argument Fight Club isn't for you.

There are many pretty Bond girls, but Daniela Bianchi is beautiful. The locations - Istanbul primarily, and on the Orient Express are fabulous. The plot is based on a real conflict - that between the West and the Soviet Union. The movie captures the Cold War vibe. Lotte Lenya, Vladek Sheybal (who I have only seen in one other movie - Women In Love) and Robert Shaw are great villains. The scene at the gypsy camp is exotic and the belly dance is great. It's a classic.So is the fight on the train. That fight has to be one of the most realistic movie fights ever. And, it's so well-choreographed. I love it!Goldfinger is generally thought to be the best Bond film. I can understand why some think so. It captures the mood of confidence that embodied the early 60s. And Sean Connery is very sexy and handsome in Goldfinger - probably his most handsome. The Goldfinger theme song is one of the best Bond songs. But, I feel that From Russia With Love tops Goldfinger as being a classic and realistic spy movie, which is what Bond is all about.

Story isn't too plausible and is quite dull in spells. The opening setup was interesting, as it painted a picture of a man in a dead-end situation. But then, just when you think the movie is going to be how he gradually works himself out of that situation, it turns out that it is all about winning a lottery, rather than hard work, essentially.The only thing that made it watchable after that was the fight scene, right at the end. The Rocky-Adrian relationship is implausible, contrived and clumsy.To add insult to injury, Sylvester Stallone got a Best Actor Oscar nomination for his series of monosyllabic grunts that pass for dialogue. In total Rocky received three Academy awards plus seven other nominations. Of these, only the nomination for Best Original Song was deserved. One of the most over-rated and over-awarded films in history.

Human drama for 90% of the film, followed by an intense fight scene. This time, however, the human drama side is more realistic and engaging and the movie flows better for it.
