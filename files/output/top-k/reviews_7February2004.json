Election is one of the worst films that I've seen just the most annoying. For example, there were too many flash and cutbacks that ruined the flow of the film.Another aspect of the film that I didn't like was the amount of chemistry between Broderick and Witherspoon, which was lacking.

Blake Edwards is, without a doubt, the finest comic director of the past fifty years, and this film is a prime example of why. The casting is flawless, the material is deeply funny, but it is the *details* that make this film the incredibly uproarious vehicle that it is. Edwards' forte is comic surprise; the little things that come completely out of left field, the sotto voce comments made (the judge telling the butler, oh, and kill the dog...then, some moments later, in the background, a gunshot rings out, Basinger miming the drunk test which Willis is easily passing, falling down in the background while trying to stand on one foot).If you haven't really *watched* this film, then do so...and learn to cherish one of filmdom's greatest talents, Blake Edwards.

By the way, that almost wrecks Clark getting close to his old high school flame Lana Lang, played by Annette O'Toole, who went on to play Ma Kent on Smallville. Then Superman returns to normal and fights a giant super computer.I'm ashamed to say that as a child it used to scare me when the computer tried to eat Superman because, well he was Superman! I have no problem now with the idea of Superman fighting a computer, but I have a problem with the rest of the film, or at least most of it. I liked Annette O'Toole as Lana Lang (much prettier and more likeable than Margot Kidder ever was as Lois Lane) and I thought Reeve himself did a decent job of portraying an evil Superman (that was actually a well staged fight in the junkyard), but the film's story just doesn't go anywhere and Richard Pryor, well, he doesn't really belong in this film, despite how much he may have liked the Superman comics. Too bad they didn't use comic book villains like Brainiac and Bizarro.Then they had to go and drag Supergirl's good name through the mud when they should have given her a push off start as a supporting character in a SUPERMAN film. Oh the shame of it.
