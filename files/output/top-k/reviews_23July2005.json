Part affectionate homage to the fast-talking movies of the 1940s (most notably 'His Girl Friday'), part playful satire on the cutthroat worlds of business and media, and a winning, immensely enjoyable metropolitan fantasy all-over, I fell in love with every single aspect of 'the Hudsucker Proxy' when I first came across it, and subsequent viewings have only left me even more convinced that I'll never be able to say enough good things about it. Certainly, there isn't a bad word to be said &#150; with its ingenious set-up, lovable hero, ravishing scenery and breath-taking score, this is a buried treasure trove of a production, well-worth digging out. The film-making siblings are as keen here as ever to demonstrate their knack for fusing the macabre with the mirthful, with an impressive 44-storey suicide leap forming one of the earliest scenes (and it is expertly done, so as to feel sad, horrific and, thanks to the reactions from various onlookers, hysterical all at once) but on the whole I'd say this rates as the most whimsical, even magical, of their efforts thus far, playing almost like their personalised take on the films of Frank Capra. It's warped, wacky and unorthodox, with their trademark Coen anarchy written all over it, but with genuine warmth and feel-goodness always nuzzling at the centre. The blend is so perfect, and with so much on offer for everyone, I have no idea why this movie has had so much trouble, since its neglected release, achieving the mass appeal it was built for.Far removed from the disquieting grittiness of 'Fargo' and 'Blood Simple' (the two Coen flicks which, incidentally, would be right up there with this one in my Top 3 list of all their output, so you know my tastes are assorted), not only is it brilliantly comical and laugh-out-loud hilarious on a consistent level, it also tells a charming and irresistible underdog tale in its most basic and effective form. Tim Robbins is at his topmost endearing (very, very high indeed) as Norville Barnes, the naive young business school graduate who makes up for what he lacks in canniness with bright ideas and guileless innocence. Arriving in New York City in the late 1950s with hopes of making it big, only to wind up toiling at the nadir of the occupational food chain in the mail rooms of the aggressive Hudsucker Industries, thanks to sheer fluke in circumstance he finds himself promoted to the top of the company in a matter of hours. There, he gets the chance to live out his personal dream of bringing his revolutionary design for a new children's toy, the 'Hula Hoop' (or, as it could just have easily been branded, the 'Wacky Circumference', amongst other possible monikers) to the world, unaware that it's all just part of a devious stock-holder ploy, and that he's little more than a puppet, or indeed, 'proxy', in the hands of the scheming Paul Newman.At the bare bones, it's the familiar saga of a good-natured man wrestling, if unwittingly, with impersonal corporate greed, the odds stacked firmly to his detriment, but leave it up to the Coens to make that feel refreshing and resourceful. The abundance of clever dialogue and snazzy scenes, in the form of everything from a dream sequence to a vintage news bulletin, to a brief commentary provided on one encounter from a pair of jaded onlookers, keeps things ticking along very smoothly, while Carter Burwell's musical score is a scintillating audio treat, splendidly structured with the on-screen action. The results of this are truly uproarious (try getting through that Hula Hoop production sequence with an entirely straight expression on your face &#150; I swear, it can't be done). But what really brings this movie to life, and one of the key reasons why I've no hesitations to award it full marks, is the sheer pull and appeal of its cast of characters. For all their exaggerated, embellished quirkiness, each and every one of them comes complete with the essential bona fide qualities needed to engage us in the story &#150; the unsuspecting, genial Norville is a charming, fascinating character you can readily warm to, his sneaky but sensitive romantic interest, journalist Amy Archer (a wonderfully dynamic Jennifer Jason Leigh), likewise, while Sidney J. Mussburger is appropriately menacing as well as amusing. They're also complimented by an unforgettable collection of support, including Moses the Clock Guy (who provides intermittent narration and addresses both the audience and the characters alike, a technique which would later be repeated in 'the Big Lebowski'), Buzz the staggeringly voluble elevator boy, a creepy, wordless janitor and, last but not least, a tee-totalling beatnik bartender played by the phenomenal Steve Buscemi (a small role, but worth a mention), all of whom have their own distinctive flavour and sparkle to add to the picture, each helping to make it that extra bit more terrific.To sum up, 'the Hudsucker Proxy' is a comic masterpiece, a laugh-riot that touches, dazzles and delights, and without doubt one of the sharpest movies to come out of the 1990s. And that's something which the general indifference of the movie-going public at the time can never take away from it. Of course, it wasn't the only film starring Tim Robbins to be denied the recognition it sorely deserved on its initial release in 1994 &#150; fortunately for 'the Shawshank Redemption', success may have taken its time but it got there eventually. I only hope that the same can be said of 'the Hudsucker Proxy' one day.

A Raisin In The Sun was ahead of its time, tackling issues that blacks could easily relate to, dealing also with the more universal issues of racism, social status, the American dream and family values. Beloved actor Sidney Pottier, the first successful black dramatic actor to win an Oscar, is quite young and relatively unknown at the time of this movie, but already showing sparks of a great actor. The role of Walter Younger was a vehicle for his dramatic stylings and several scenes seem tailor-made for him such as Walter's reaction when supposed friend Willy Harris backs off from the plan of running the liquor store and takes his money, his humbling prayer on his knees monologue and his confrontation with Karl Linder refusing to take his money and opting to move into the all-white neighborhood.

Like hundreds of other IMDb reviewers have said, the special effects are momentous. They have a hypnotic affect on you, not because they're exciting, they aren't, but for the reason that they are just so beautiful to watch.Whenever I view a film the first thing I want to know is when it was made and consequentially there after I can view it in it's proper context. I wasn't born in 1968 in fact it would be another 13 years before I would start my own Odyssey. If I would have seen it back then before man had been to the moon for instance or while the Cold War was raging, people were wondering if there WAS going to be a human race let alone what we would be like in the future. Nuclear Annihilation was a real possibility.... and then this film comes along. Something that people had never seen the likes of before. It must have been what many have said on these pages, 'a real experience'. It is something that makes you stop and think, back then and now. I've just watched it recently after a number of years and there definitely is a enduring quality about it. The questions it raises are still pertinent today and it still looks fantastic. The thing that has changed is the way they make films nowadays and who they are designed for. I mean do you really think Kubrick sat back in his little directors chair on set and thought to himself 'this film is going to be great for 12 year-olds to go and see on a Saturday night...they can leave their brains at the door'. Of course not. This film will only interest people who expect to be challenged by film makers in what they watch. Sure you could re-cut the film and lose 3\/4 of the running time and not miss anything important and technically it would be a better film. However that's not the point of this film. The narrative and plotting are irrelevant. It's the questions the film raises about humans, our origins, our future, our strengths and weaknesses that are the key driving themes of this picture. One of my favourite phrases I like to tell myself is this ; You can't tell where you're going until you know where you've been. This film is a visual adventure through time and space. It does have its problems though.A lot of the sequences are vastly overindulgent. They are just last too long. You could watch this on DVD on x2 speed and it may be even better who knows. The pacing is a problem but nothing that would be fatal to the viewer. And you have to remember that in 1968 you are meant to be in awe of the space spectacle you are observing and therefore expected to lap up every second of it. After all, if you're doing something pioneering, why have a 10 second shot when you can have a 60 second one I say. It does grate on you severely from time to time though.Another disturbing aspect to proceedings is the characterisation. At times I felt like I had more empathy with the apes at the start of the film as they clubbed each other over the head compared to some of the supposedly 'evolved' humans we meet later on. They have no human features. They look human, they act human, they even sound human occasionally but I remain unconvinced. It frustrates me that you are meant to be telling the story of evolution of the human race and none of them seem to embody any of the qualities you usually attribute to us. Hal the ships computer had a better acting style and he was just a red light and a guy in a sound booth. And like I say the guys in the ape suits did a better job at the start then anyone else later on.I can totally understand why people don't like this film. Everyone wants something different from their cinema experience. Unfortunately most people who watch films nowadays seem to want all the questions not only answered but spoon fed to them in the process. 2001 does neither of these things. It just makes you think, a lot of people don't like doing that nowadays.Having said that, I myself wouldn't rate it highly on my personal list because I find it a bit contrived and self-indulgent. It also lacks any real flow or continuity. Also, for me a good film has to have characters I enjoy relating to. 2001 doesn't have them, it has good ideas and concepts but falls a little short in achieving them. I say again the visuals are superb, for the time and now. It just makes me strengthen by belief that CGI still can't offer the same realism and grounding a good miniature modal can. The better recent films marry CGI and miniatures however, too many solely rely on the power of their CPU chips for effects.I may not particularly like 2001 but I respect what it wanted to achieve and it definitely was a seminal motion picture. People who disregard it out of hand don't fully realise that without it there would be no films like Star Wars, Star Trek, to The Terminator etc.Science fiction for nearly 40 years now has had its cinematic roots firmly embedded within 2001 A Space Odyssey and for that this film will always have my firm respect and admiration if not my affection.

Did you know Spielberg was originally supposed to direct, until Miss Rowling insisted it HAD to be an all British cast, in walks in Chris Columbus, a guy who directed Robin Williams in becoming a woman in Mrs. Doubtfire, and a guy who's obviously willing to give in to any demand thrown at him by the author as long as he makes money. Well Mr. Columbus seemed to direct Ron into acting like a woman as well. You throw in a B list of child actors and a list of acclaimed adult actors who are far past their prime and who only opted to make these films because their grandchildren begged them to, and you have the first Harry Potter movie. There has never been a more horrific performance than that of Rupert Grint, who now dominates the worst performances of all time, kicking Jake Lloyd from The Phantom Menace out of the way. Daniel Radcliffe doesn't really possess much talent either, I highly doubt he has any future after this film, as far as acting goes anyways. As for Emma Watson, who thinks she's the best in the world, and if you think I'm talking about her performance as Hermione, you're dead wrong, have you listened to her in interviews? The room can barely fit the three of them; her, the interviewer, and her ego. Her performance is also astonishingly bad. I forgot to mention the horrible special effects, I have seen better on TV watching Power Rangers. I mentioned the Lord of the Rings earlier to make reference to the obvious ripoffs of Miss Rowling. Firstly there are the dementors, cloaked ghostlike figures whose faces you never see (cough, RINGWRAITHS!). The whomping willow seems to ring a bell (ENTZ). The Giant Spider named Aragog (SHELOB). The trolls also seem to resemble something I've seen before... OH YEAH, the trolls in Lord of the Rings! Hopefully Warner Bros. choice of hiring different directors for the rest of the films will pay off. But this is the perfect example of a book that could have made an Oscar worthy classical movie, but fell short because instead of making it what it was intended to be they chose to skimp on the effects to make more money on little kids who think it's great because they're too young to watch real special effects in Star Wars or LotR. It really makes me sad, because in the months prior to the first movie I was marveling at the promise of it all. Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, they got John Williams to do the score, and like that, it was ruined. Although it does seem that my opinion differs from the rest of the world as Miss Rowling is just raking it in and so are the filmmakers, making even more money by skimping on the special effects that will no doubt succeed in dazzling children who aren't yet potty trained.

It was surprisingly good alien epic that I have hardly ever seen. The fair script and the good acting carry the film.It starts off with city sized alien ships that come to earth from the moon and hover above Washington D.C., New York, and Los Angeles. The cities erupt in horror, and by nightfall, the ship destroy the city with giant laser blasts.Its an emotional roller-coaster from beginning to end. A story about the world putting away their differences for a worthy cause to stop the aliens. Its something you don't see these days.There were several clichés in the film too. Like Will Smith being able to learn how to drive an alien cruiser just after seeing how they maneuver in battle. I thought that that was kind of stupid.But the graphics were spectacular. its easy to see how the film won the Oscar for best graphics.

Perhaps this is because so much of Hollywood shares Le Carre's own moral obtuseness -- wishing bureaucratic tyranny upon the rest of the world, while insulating itself with money.Le Carre cannot tell the difference between West and East, between the bumbling mediocrity of western bureaucracies, and the unremitting evil of the Soviet bureaus, which owned everything in the evil empire, right down to peoples' souls. The Russia House was the first of his many post Cold War novels to make it clear that he could not, or would not.Yet the man does write brilliantly. Le Carre is one of the great masters of English prose. Therefore one can almost forgive his blockheadedness, while one enjoys his rich descriptions, his twisted characters, and his sharp storytelling. It's only the morning after finishing one of his novels, or the hour after watching a movie adaptation such as this, that one's head begins to throb with the bitter, pointless, imbecility of his world view.The cast of The Russia House, headlined by Sean Connery and Michelle Pfeiffer, is superb, with one glaring exception -- Roy Scheider in pancake makeup is simply not plausible as a CIA manager, even mid level. By contrast James Woods does an excellent job as his opposite number in British Intelligence (with support from a young Michael Kitchen, now the graying star of Foyle's War). But this movie is mainly worth watching for the engaging lead performances by Connery and Pfeiffer, even though (or perhaps because) they play their characters quite differently than they were drawn in the book.The location photography is excellent, with nice views of Lisbon, and many long sequences shot in Moscow and Leningrad. Moscow looks nearly deserted, a graphic reminder that the official Soviet population figure, 5 million, was overstated by at least a factor of seven (according to Robert Heinlein).There are interludes of wistful jazz woven seamlessly into the story, but much of the rest of the musical score is loud and distracting, especially toward the end. I suppose it was intended to induce anxiety in viewers who could not follow what was happening in the complicated plot. The director should have stuck with the jazz.* By far the best screen adaptation of a Le Carre novel is The Little Drummer Girl directed by George Roy Hill. It is one of the best movies ever made.A very good movie that shows an intimate slice of life in the Soviet Union is the French film East-West (Est-Ouest).

His wife is given the opportunity to let Dr. Webb graft a new arm on him. While he is being sedated, he appears to see a decapitation. There are a number of injuries, dismemberments, and shootings in the movie, and they're all pretty gory, though the movie is not wall-to-wall gore.Somehow he doesn't notice, nor does his wife, that he has a tattoo on his new arm until a patient points it out to him. This makes him want to learn where the arm came from, along with the fact that he is having nightmares, and some violent impulses.In the novel this was very loosely based on, the main character is not a person who's gotten a graft. He's a person who's been appointed to keep an eye on people who've gotten grafts, to see that they are doing well (or not). There are seven people in all who have received them (there aren't as many in the film). They all know almost from the start who their parts came from originally. The new parts look better than their old ones, while in the film the arm looks like it was taken from an old corpse, even though it wasn't. They don't have violent impulses, but are exposed to new temptations.

Perhaps then it was my expectations that led to the disappointment I felt by the film's end. There are plenty of things to like, but not enough thrills to really be a great thriller.First the good A solid cast gives us characters with real depth throughout. They maintained interest for me even when the story took some implausible or uninspired turns. For example, the actors' telling of the content of the dreams they have is much more involving than the content of the dream itself. Dreams can be weird, but usually we notice they are. For a character to put such belief in a purely obvious art-house movie dream concept was a serious flaw in the story. But the actors made their characters' belief credible, so one can still suspend disbelief - it didn't bring the film to a halt even though it should have for me.Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu is absolutely chilling as a man on a bizarre and dangerous journey to understand himself. His part of the story is the most consistent and he's the reason to watch the film, in my opinion. But that brings me to the bad points. His character had so much depth, that I saw where he was going with his intentions. This telegraphed the ending for me; not in detail but certainly in overall outcome. As for Gene Bervoets' character, while again well acted, made too many of those decisions where you just want to talk to the screen and tell the character, are you stupid? or don't do that!. I'm always disappointed whenever the audience knows what to do (or not to do) but the character just ignores all common sense, reasoning, and any information before them, for no reason other than to move the film forward or just make it longer.Perhaps just as bad is the omission of the obvious in a story. SPOORLOOS has a curious ambiguity with regard to law enforcement's roll in the film's events that Hitchcock would never have overlooked. I can't elaborate without revealing things, but I wonder which is worse when police don't show up at all in a thriller, or when they show up only at convenient plot points.So while I found the first half of the film interesting and the characters engaging for the most part, SPOORLOOS fell way short of its reputation. I won't say it's entirely predictable, just a lot more than it should have been. I was annoyed that while credits rolled, I could come up with better ways to resolve the story.That left me with a few questions, two of which are is a suspense film really suspenseful when you can figure out the ending 20-30 minutes before it happens? How much of a thriller has to be thrilling to be a good one? Maybe this is more about what a viewer expects, and what they've seen before. Perhaps it was better when it came out (but there's still the comparisons to Hitchcock and how much better he could craft this type of thriller).
