Well, I have to beg to differ.  First if you look at the three actor's and their film career's, you would understand.  Ice Cube was in BOYZ N' THE HOOD, Mark Wahlberg was in BOOGIE NIGHTS, and George Clooney was in OUT OF SIGHT.  Now all three of these underrated and talented actors star in the new David (FLIRTING WITH DISASTER) O. Russell film titled THREE KINGS.      THREE KINGS is set in 1991, as the U.S. troops are celebrating the cease fire from Iraq in Operation Desert Storm. Sgt. Troy Barlow (Mark Wahlberg) and his friend\/protege, Pvt. Conrad Vig (Spike Jonze) find a map that leds to a Iraqi bunker with items seized by Sadam Hussein's troops.  One of the items is tons of seized Kuwait gold bullion.  Meanwhile, Special Forces Captain Archie Gates, get wind of these Iraqi bunkers with gold, and finds out that Sgt. Barlow found a map leading to the bunkers.  Gates orders Barlow, Vig, and the religious and serious Sgt. Chief Elgin (Ice Cube) to go with him to steal back the Kuwait gold, and to split it among each other.  Gates figures that it's only fair to get this gold since all he did during the operation is baby-sit pouty network journalist Adriana Cruz (Nora Dunn).        The soldiers expect this mission to be quick in and out job, and that they'll be back before the end of the morning. What the troops didn't expect is the treatment of the Iraq civilians given by Hussein's troops.  The civilians are beaten and even killed by Hussein's soldiers, and they ban any shipments of food or water to the people.  When the U.S. soldiers see this, they're not suppose to react, since they are to follow President Bush orders on not to interfer with Iraq's politics.  But these men begin to have a change of heart, and decide to alter their plans.      I was very surprised on how excellent THREE KINGS was.  I figured that it would have been another clever action film like FACE\/OFF and MATRIX.  I was wrong, this film is more than a action film, it has comedy, wit, and even emotional scenes. This film has quite a few disturbing inages of the violence of war, and the terror that many Iraq civilians, including children, were facing.  Russell does a unique job of showing images of the character's thoughts and flashbacks.  I haven't seen such rapid, yet memorable editing of images since the late Stanley Kubrick's work in A CLOCKWORK ORANGE.  Also, Russell does a great homage to Sam Peckinpah with slow-motion gun shots and deaths, similar to the WILD BUNCH.        I was pleased with the acting also, Clooney stood out as the tough and intelligent leader, while Wahlberg was also good as the sensitive soldier.  And Cube is good as the very serious soldier who has faith in his mission.  The plot, also written by Russell, is very witty and great.  It mixws a terrific blend of action, comedy, suspense, and drama, to where it's taken seriously and not sarcastic.  Before seeing this film, I heard that this film, along with AMERICAN BEAUTY, was a strong Oscar consideration for this year.  I didn't believe it, and couldn't believe it, until I saw the movie.  Now I'll be very upset if it doesn't get nominated for Best Picture.  It does to Operation Desert Storm, what SAVING PRIVATE RYAN did for World War II.

To be sure, it does have all the elements that should have added up to a classic tale of an `American Tragedy'---skinheads, guns, betrayal, and the final price of redemption---but somehow the end result seems all too neat and clear-cut (`black-and-white,' if you will) to be totally convincing.The acting, as advertised, was very, very good. Edward Norton did a fine job of rendering a believable (despite the shortcomings of the script) portrait of a troubled, yet bright and sensitive young man, and does deserve all the credit he has received. Having said that, I must say that it was the other Edward who really gave me a pleasant surprise. Furlong's role as Danny is by no means as showy as Norton's, but his performance was every bit as impressive. By bringing a rich mixture of quiet intensity and genuine sense of innocence to the role, Furlong has made Danny into someone very `real', someone you would actually care for---the sweet boy next door who's going through a rough, confusing period.Stacy Keach is one veteran who is always dependable, and in this film, he is chilling, dangerous, and oddly hilarious all at once. Good show for him! In fact, I liked everyone's performance with the exception of one Avery Brooks as Dr. Sweeney. I do acknowledge the fact that he's supposed to be the strict-but-fair `guardian angel', and must therefore carry a certain measure of `weight of authority' in playing this role, but boy, there is such a thing called `overdoing it'. Frankly, he looked so stiff and uncomfortable that I began to suspect that maybe his suit was too heavily starched. It's a shame because Brooks is actually a good actor who hasn't been too lucky in getting meaningful roles such as this one.All in all, the film is a solid one, the superb acting compensating for the lack of depth in terms of story development. It is a well-known fact that director Tony Kaye tried to get his name off the whole project due to `creative differences'. I have no way of telling, but I vaguely suspect that he was aiming for a direction that would have been more in line with what I had expected to see in this film. It would be interesting if he decides to tell his version by releasing a `director's cut' at some point.

It's a shame because Brooks is actually a good actor who hasn't been too lucky in getting meaningful roles such as this one.All in all, the film is a solid one, the superb acting compensating for the lack of depth in terms of story development. It is a well-known fact that director Tony Kaye tried to get his name off the whole project due to `creative differences'. I have no way of telling, but I vaguely suspect that he was aiming for a direction that would have been more in line with what I had expected to see in this film. It would be interesting if he decides to tell his version by releasing a `director's cut' at some point.

The only reason I watched it was because it happened to be on cable. I'd be upset if I'd actually payed money to rent it much less see in the theatre (of course I never had any intention of either). Pretty much every character in the movie is completely shallow and not believable, including Amanda and Preston, whom we're supposed to be rooting for. The only reason these two characters look good is because everybody else is so bad.

It's a quirky, offbeat but beautiful film that engages you from start to finnish. The chemistry of the two characters, when they're together,is magical and the light comedy touch over blatant comedy, which they could have gone for here, is the key to it's success.

I got to see Steven Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind with someone who had never seen it before.  Indeed, it was thrilling to put myself in his shoes and realizing just how confusing the movie really is.  The plot jumps around dangerously from one (seemingly) unrelated scene to another, leaving the audience in the dust several times.  More often than once, my friend turned to me and said, What the heck is going on?  I never did tell him, of course, partly because I didn't want to spoil the surprises, but also because I was watching it for the very first time, again.  And then, there were the scenes that still leave audience members breathless, those scenes that pull us into the screen, as if our eyes have become magnets.  It is not until the end of those scenes that we realize we've been holding out breath the entire time.The film is great across the board.  It was especially effective for Spielberg to write the screenplay himself, because for the first time, the script and the film shared the same marvelous, disjointed style.  This is also one of John Williams's finest scores.  Seriously, it beats the living heck out of more familiar soundtracks like Star Wars and Indiana Jones.  Also, the acting is absolutely superb, especially Richard Dreyfuss as Roy Neary, the innocent bystander who is suddenly thrown in the middle of all of it.I do have one slight criticism, and I fear that it really damages the overall effect of the film.  My rating on the film would be higher if this one thing had been changed.  (Warning  This is sort of a spoiler!)  When the alien vessel is communicating with the humans, why did Spielberg decide to use a tuba sound?  Seriously, it throws away the idea of the aliens being so out of this world, and sounds altogether silly, in my opinion.  Still, considering that this is my only complaint with the film, it's still one of the great ones.  Do yourself a favor and see it.***1\/2 out of ****.
