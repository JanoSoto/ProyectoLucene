I always wanted to see it, but my parents didn't buy the movie. I think because the film at the time had gotten Luke warm reviews, but over the years it seems like James and the Giant Peach got a cult following and an audience to boot. After all, we don't really get some of these great animated films that were from the 90's. Plus whenever there's a dark family film, a lot of parents tend to look down on it. I think today's parents have become a little too protective in my opinion. However, I had the opportunity to see the film yesterday and gladly watched it. I admit, my hopes were maybe a bit high, but I can see why the reviews were mixed on this one.James Henry Trotter is a young boy who lives with his parents by the sea. On James's birthday, they plan to go to New York City. However, his parents are later killed by a ghostly rhinoceros from the sky and finds himself living with his two cruel aunts, Spiker and Sponge. He is forced to work all day and they threaten him with beatings to keep him in line and taunt him about the mysterious rhino and other hazards if he tries to leave. While rescuing a spider from being squashed by his aunts, James meets a mysterious man with a bag of magic greens, which he gives to James to make his life better When James is returning to the house, he trips and the green beans escape into the ground. One peach is soon found on a withered old tree, and it grows. The aunts use the giant peach as an attraction, making lots of money as James watches from the house, not allowed to leave. That night, James is sent to pick up the garbage. While doing so, he grabs a chunk of the peach to eat. A large hole appears inside the peach and James ventures inside, were he finds and befriends a group of life-size anthropomorphic bugs who also dream of an ideal home and decide to travel to New York.I think if I saw this as a kid, I would've adored it. As an adult, I see that there scenes that lead to no where and there are some things that are not explained in the film that are explained in the book. I remember reading the book in elementary school and if you didn't read the book, I think you would be totally lost with the whole killer rhino ordeal. Also the aunts are so one note, first off, how is it this kid has the kindest parents in the world with the nastiest sisters who are extremely ugly and obviously hate kids? Yeah, I'm sure when the parents were writing their wills they said Now, if something happens to us, who will take care of James&#x85;How about your parents who call and write letters daily and adore him?&#x85;No, I don't think they'll like him living with them&#x85;True, how about your 2 evil ugly sisters who hate him and love to beat him?&#x85;Perfect!. However, the animation is absolutely wonderful and really takes you back into Nightmare Before Christmas, in fact, there is even a cameo appearance by Jack Skeleton. The songs are charming and all of the characters are great too, even if not consistent. Like I don't get how the spider says she doesn't like socializing with anyone, but is clearly singing and dancing with them in the next scene without complaint. But for the kids, this is a great film that gives them hope to dream. I wish I would've seen it as a kid. But I still like it despite the flaws, considering that I think I'm just nitpicking at this point. I can understand why James and the Giant Peach found it's audience and where it will end up in the classics one day.7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"20 May 2012","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" I remember when I was a kid and would slip in my Nightmare Before Christmas VHS tape, one of the trailers that was on it was James and the Giant Peach.

Linda Fiorentino is good in her supporting bit as is Vincent D'Onofrio as the mutant trying to take over the world. The special effects in the film certainly don't hold up as well today compared to more modern CGI flicks but they're still quite nice.

There where few good jokes now and then but their either spoiled by bad timing or they simply didn't have the money for better special effects and most of the visual gags looks simply bad. Much of the Popeye's dialog is hard to heard. Im not sure is it editing fault since I can see this movie work on paper but much of the scenes simply look bad from the story telling point of few. The musical numbers are just getting worse and worse. One exception is the song I yam what I yam with felt OK but that's about it.I guess it has cult fallowing and you may enjoy it if love watching incredible bad films but overall it as bad it can get.

Unfortunately, they went in a different direction and really killed the series with Aliens3 - I did not pay to see it because of all the negative publicity and just the fact that it really wasted the characters that were saved from the previous movie. I watched it later on and it was lousy and the whole story line disappointing . Alien resurrection was another bad attempt to revive the series and really you ask why? . I cant put all the Alien crossover stuff in the same category like Alien\/Predator and all the comic book ones with Batman and Superman etc because they are all cash ins off Alien and not original ideas .I mean anyone can take something and toss it in the mix - like say Cowboys Vs Aliens where you start making stuff up and throwing it together. Like all the Abe Lincoln Vampire Hunter and Pride and Prejudice and Zombies ideas because people start doing weird things - It can make for a fun movie but when you start milking the original idea too much and diluting it - it is just tired and needs to be left alone.

Amateau) & Blythe (Majory Graue) finds his pretty girlfriend Tangerine (Katie Barberi) at Captain Manzini's Antique Shop where she is talking to fourteen year old boy Dodger (Mackenzie Astin), Juice becomes jealous & angry & beats Dodger up leaving in a nearby sewer covered in sewage. During the fight in the shop an old garbage pail was knocked over which green slime oozes out of, then seven disgusting ugly looking kids emerge ranging from Greaser Greg to Valerie Vomit. All are short, ugly & have poor social skills but still want to help Dodger win the affection of Tangerine whom he has a huge crush on. Tangerine is into fashion & they make some clothes which impress Tangerine & make her notice Dodger who couldn't be happier but it seems that she is only using Dodger to further her own fashion designing career & once Juice finds out about the garbage pail kids he sends them to the state home for the ugly to be put down for good...Co-written & directed by Rod Amateau this notorious film is based on the Topps Chewing Gum card series The Garbage Pail Kids which were at their most popular back in the mid 80's & were a big craze back then, I myself collected them as a kid & still have several hundred original cards from the first eight series that were released here in the UK & I actually dug them out a few days ago to have a look at them & that got me interested in watching this film again since I distinctly remember seeing it at the cinema back when it originally came out. I can't say I remembered much from the film but there were a few scenes here & there that seemed familiar, anyway The Garbage Pail Kids is generally considered one of the worst films ever made amongst regular movie goers but as a bad film I found it somewhat enjoyable despite being terrible. The film lasts for 96 minutes & despite being pretty awful in every conceivable way I had great fun with it & I certainly wasn't bored, the script is a mess that is so uneven & misjudged it's difficult to understand. Some of the jokes & gags are tasteless & bordering on perverted. From Messy Tessy & her snot problem to Windy Winston who farts loudly all the time to Ali Gator who just wants to eat people toes these kids lack basic social manners. There are some uncomfortable moments as well, like the fourteen year old Dodget getting excited when Tangerine changes shirts or when he has a bath & someone notes that he has 'nice legs' (this is a fourteen year old boy!) in a suggestive manner, Dodger is beaten up & mugged in broad daylight yet no-one helps him & the bizarre concept of the state home for the ugly which is played in creepy & sinister seriousness is just wrong. The whole film is wrong, the story is all over the place with a strange mortality tale at it's heart that seems to be building up to a feel good happy ending but doesn't particularly end well for anyone as the bullies are beaten, Tangerine is exposed, Dodger is left heartbroken & the garbage pail kids ride off into the distance to cause more havoc after their friends are killed back at the state home for the ugly.The Garbage ail Kids Movie really has to be seen to be believed, there's even a musical number about halfway through as the kids break out into song. There's a bit of gore as Ali Gator eats eyeballs & severed toes, some very tasteless moments like Windy Windston ripping some loud farts & Valerie Vomit finally projectile vomiting green sick over a couple of people. But then again without these moments this would have been as boring as they come. The special effects vary, the kids are really odd looking, they just look sort of weird & creepy & freaky. They are sort of cartoon monstrosities brought into the real world, they have little movement as far as facial features go which gives them a strange stiffness. They all look quite rubbery & surreal yet I ended up quite liking them. Despite being cast as great fashion designers the clothes on show are awful & where did the names of these people come from? Who exactly calls someone Tangerine? The whole film is very 80's & for that I am not complaining. The opening sequence is bizarre & a features a spaceship shaped like a garbage pail that wobbles all over the place like one of the strings holding it up has broken! Totally random & has nothing to do with the rest of the film.With a lifetime gross of just over $1,500,000 this was a huge flop (although it was barely released) so the news that a new Garbage Pail Kids Movie is to be made seems a gamble but it's one I'd like to see considering the advances in technology & special effects. The whole film looks cheap & very dated but that's part of it's charm I think. The acting is poor but in an entertainingly bad way, not just stiff & wooden but over the top & hammy.The Garbage Pail Kids Movie is a film with a really bad reputation but I have to fly in the face of popular opinion here & say I enjoyed it for what it is, the original cards were brilliant & imaginative & funny & disgusting & gross & wonderfully painted while the film is just surreal & wrong but I liked it none the less.

Amateau) & Blythe (Majory Graue) finds his pretty girlfriend Tangerine (Katie Barberi) at Captain Manzini's Antique Shop where she is talking to fourteen year old boy Dodger (Mackenzie Astin), Juice becomes jealous & angry & beats Dodger up leaving in a nearby sewer covered in sewage. During the fight in the shop an old garbage pail was knocked over which green slime oozes out of, then seven disgusting ugly looking kids emerge ranging from Greaser Greg to Valerie Vomit. All are short, ugly & have poor social skills but still want to help Dodger win the affection of Tangerine whom he has a huge crush on. Tangerine is into fashion & they make some clothes which impress Tangerine & make her notice Dodger who couldn't be happier but it seems that she is only using Dodger to further her own fashion designing career & once Juice finds out about the garbage pail kids he sends them to the state home for the ugly to be put down for good...Co-written & directed by Rod Amateau this notorious film is based on the Topps Chewing Gum card series The Garbage Pail Kids which were at their most popular back in the mid 80's & were a big craze back then, I myself collected them as a kid & still have several hundred original cards from the first eight series that were released here in the UK & I actually dug them out a few days ago to have a look at them & that got me interested in watching this film again since I distinctly remember seeing it at the cinema back when it originally came out. I can't say I remembered much from the film but there were a few scenes here & there that seemed familiar, anyway The Garbage Pail Kids is generally considered one of the worst films ever made amongst regular movie goers but as a bad film I found it somewhat enjoyable despite being terrible. The film lasts for 96 minutes & despite being pretty awful in every conceivable way I had great fun with it & I certainly wasn't bored, the script is a mess that is so uneven & misjudged it's difficult to understand. Some of the jokes & gags are tasteless & bordering on perverted. From Messy Tessy & her snot problem to Windy Winston who farts loudly all the time to Ali Gator who just wants to eat people toes these kids lack basic social manners. There are some uncomfortable moments as well, like the fourteen year old Dodget getting excited when Tangerine changes shirts or when he has a bath & someone notes that he has 'nice legs' (this is a fourteen year old boy!) in a suggestive manner, Dodger is beaten up & mugged in broad daylight yet no-one helps him & the bizarre concept of the state home for the ugly which is played in creepy & sinister seriousness is just wrong. The whole film is wrong, the story is all over the place with a strange mortality tale at it's heart that seems to be building up to a feel good happy ending but doesn't particularly end well for anyone as the bullies are beaten, Tangerine is exposed, Dodger is left heartbroken & the garbage pail kids ride off into the distance to cause more havoc after their friends are killed back at the state home for the ugly.The Garbage ail Kids Movie really has to be seen to be believed, there's even a musical number about halfway through as the kids break out into song. There's a bit of gore as Ali Gator eats eyeballs & severed toes, some very tasteless moments like Windy Windston ripping some loud farts & Valerie Vomit finally projectile vomiting green sick over a couple of people. But then again without these moments this would have been as boring as they come. The special effects vary, the kids are really odd looking, they just look sort of weird & creepy & freaky. They are sort of cartoon monstrosities brought into the real world, they have little movement as far as facial features go which gives them a strange stiffness. They all look quite rubbery & surreal yet I ended up quite liking them. Despite being cast as great fashion designers the clothes on show are awful & where did the names of these people come from? Who exactly calls someone Tangerine? The whole film is very 80's & for that I am not complaining. The opening sequence is bizarre & a features a spaceship shaped like a garbage pail that wobbles all over the place like one of the strings holding it up has broken! Totally random & has nothing to do with the rest of the film.With a lifetime gross of just over $1,500,000 this was a huge flop (although it was barely released) so the news that a new Garbage Pail Kids Movie is to be made seems a gamble but it's one I'd like to see considering the advances in technology & special effects. The whole film looks cheap & very dated but that's part of it's charm I think. The acting is poor but in an entertainingly bad way, not just stiff & wooden but over the top & hammy.The Garbage Pail Kids Movie is a film with a really bad reputation but I have to fly in the face of popular opinion here & say I enjoyed it for what it is, the original cards were brilliant & imaginative & funny & disgusting & gross & wonderfully painted while the film is just surreal & wrong but I liked it none the less.

It is a dark comedy because it is a satire on the Cold War, which most people during the time probably did not find to be very entertaining.The characters in this film are very memorable.

The characters individually are not particularly interesting, but the way that they combined to create a mockery of the war was truly a masterpiece.

While action was taking place, it did not feel that it was actually moving. Typically, the setting changes as the plot moves on, but this movie lacked that. I suppose that's not necessarily a flaw, it's just something that stood out to me.I feel that this movie is pretty relevant even though it is 48 years old.

I still have vivid memories of sitting through this interminable film and over forty years later still remembered it as the distilled essence of boredom. It can't possibly be as bad as I remember, I told myself. I must have been too young to appreciate it at the time. Still somehow I never got around to trying it again.Recently I acquired a box set of David Lean films running from his first as director, In Which We Serve, through to Hobson's Choice in 1954. All the films had some restoration work done to them and they all looked good. In fact I wasn't prepared for just how good some of the films were. Of course, I was familiar with Brief Encounter and Great Expectations, both as good as ever but I wasn't prepared for just how good all the rest were. Passionate Friends is similar in some ways to Brief Encounter to my eyes a much more adult treatment of the issues than the rather soppy, though irresistible, Brief Encounter. Oliver Twist quite took my breath away with its cinematography and Robert Newton's portrayal of Bill Sykes, a singularly chilling performance which is far more disturbing than the anaemic serial killers we see in more recent films. It was all looking promising then for a reappraisal of Lawrence of Arabia. Even so the DVD sat unwatched on a shelf for several months, so bad was my memory of the original experience of seeing it. Eventually the fateful day arrived (well two days to tell the truth as I stopped at the original intermission and resumed the next day).So, was it any better than my memories suggested? Not much. At least I knew a little more about the history than I did before and could find something interesting from that point of view. But otherwise it was every bit as bombastic, boring and ennui-inducing as I had found it originally. On IMDb I see that the average score is 8.6 and it ranks at number 42 in the top 250 so someone clearly likes it. Here's why all those people are wrong 1 The film has been praised for its cinematography, particularly the desert photography. I'll agree that there are some good shots but they aren't that great. If I want desert shots I can see much better by buying the box set of Life and watching the episode on deserts. In fact I can find a dozen BBC series, usually in High Definition and usually narrated by David Attenborough which outstrip anything in Lawrence. If you like desert shots my advice would be get the documentaries instead and turn off the sound so you aren't disturbed by Attenborough droning on and on. In fact play some good desert music like Tinarewen in the background, turn the central heating up and refuse to drink water for 24 hours for a really good effect.2 The majority of the film is taken up by Lawrence seemingly crossing deserts in real time. This is both boring and pointless as a filmic experience. An alternative would be to try (1) above.3 The theme tune &#x96; you know, the one you can't get out of your head even if you try, occurs exactly when and where you think it will, usually signalling another real time trek across another bloody desert (or back again). At least you can enliven your viewing experience by predicting when the theme tune will come back in &#x96; I guarantee you'll get it right every time.4 The action scenes all run left to right (or is it right to left, I forget). There's a reason for this which I also forget but bores on IMDb can explain it to you. Despite the huge numbers of extras, camels etc employed it generates some really unimpressive battle scenes when you start to notice the left-to-rightness of the action.5 I've not read any of T.E. Lawrence's original writing but I'd be very surprised to learn he was such a crashing, pompous bore and bigot as the portrayal in this film suggests. The character in the film is so deeply unlikable as to immediately nullify my suspension of disbelief. My mind keeps interrupting my concentration as it asks how anyone can be inspired to follow this idiot.6 Many say that Peter O'Toole's portrayal is magnetic, compelling, heroic and so on in this film. I say his acting suggests that he is completely bewildered by what the character is supposed to be like so he's just settled for acting mad and unpleasant whilst staring distractedly into space.7 Goggles on a bush.

I still have vivid memories of sitting through this interminable film and over forty years later still remembered it as the distilled essence of boredom. It can't possibly be as bad as I remember, I told myself. I must have been too young to appreciate it at the time. Still somehow I never got around to trying it again.Recently I acquired a box set of David Lean films running from his first as director, In Which We Serve, through to Hobson's Choice in 1954. All the films had some restoration work done to them and they all looked good. In fact I wasn't prepared for just how good some of the films were. Of course, I was familiar with Brief Encounter and Great Expectations, both as good as ever but I wasn't prepared for just how good all the rest were. Passionate Friends is similar in some ways to Brief Encounter to my eyes a much more adult treatment of the issues than the rather soppy, though irresistible, Brief Encounter. Oliver Twist quite took my breath away with its cinematography and Robert Newton's portrayal of Bill Sykes, a singularly chilling performance which is far more disturbing than the anaemic serial killers we see in more recent films. It was all looking promising then for a reappraisal of Lawrence of Arabia. Even so the DVD sat unwatched on a shelf for several months, so bad was my memory of the original experience of seeing it. Eventually the fateful day arrived (well two days to tell the truth as I stopped at the original intermission and resumed the next day).So, was it any better than my memories suggested? Not much. At least I knew a little more about the history than I did before and could find something interesting from that point of view. But otherwise it was every bit as bombastic, boring and ennui-inducing as I had found it originally. On IMDb I see that the average score is 8.6 and it ranks at number 42 in the top 250 so someone clearly likes it. Here's why all those people are wrong 1 The film has been praised for its cinematography, particularly the desert photography. I'll agree that there are some good shots but they aren't that great. If I want desert shots I can see much better by buying the box set of Life and watching the episode on deserts. In fact I can find a dozen BBC series, usually in High Definition and usually narrated by David Attenborough which outstrip anything in Lawrence. If you like desert shots my advice would be get the documentaries instead and turn off the sound so you aren't disturbed by Attenborough droning on and on. In fact play some good desert music like Tinarewen in the background, turn the central heating up and refuse to drink water for 24 hours for a really good effect.2 The majority of the film is taken up by Lawrence seemingly crossing deserts in real time. This is both boring and pointless as a filmic experience. An alternative would be to try (1) above.3 The theme tune &#x96; you know, the one you can't get out of your head even if you try, occurs exactly when and where you think it will, usually signalling another real time trek across another bloody desert (or back again). At least you can enliven your viewing experience by predicting when the theme tune will come back in &#x96; I guarantee you'll get it right every time.4 The action scenes all run left to right (or is it right to left, I forget). There's a reason for this which I also forget but bores on IMDb can explain it to you. Despite the huge numbers of extras, camels etc employed it generates some really unimpressive battle scenes when you start to notice the left-to-rightness of the action.5 I've not read any of T.E. Lawrence's original writing but I'd be very surprised to learn he was such a crashing, pompous bore and bigot as the portrayal in this film suggests. The character in the film is so deeply unlikable as to immediately nullify my suspension of disbelief. My mind keeps interrupting my concentration as it asks how anyone can be inspired to follow this idiot.6 Many say that Peter O'Toole's portrayal is magnetic, compelling, heroic and so on in this film. I say his acting suggests that he is completely bewildered by what the character is supposed to be like so he's just settled for acting mad and unpleasant whilst staring distractedly into space.7 Goggles on a bush.

Everyone else is basically fine, but when your two lead performances are this bad, you can't expect the final results to be that good. Thankfully, the movie has a sweetness to it that's often endearing, even when it's not being particularly good. There are some very funny moments, too.

Fast forward almost 30 years and I find myself buying this title on Bluray and watching it with my wife for some kinky fun. Although it starts out interesting, Dressed To Kill has little plot to develop after the first 30 minutes. It is obvious that Dr. Elliott (Michael Caine) is the mad psycho in the movie. Anyone who knows how to count to ten can figure that out very early in the movie. Released during the slasher era craze of the early 1980's, Dressed To Kill bummed those looking for the cheap thrills and explicit violence of Friday The 13th and Maniac. Brian DePalma's movie tries hard to please everyone from suspense to slasher fans, without accomplishing much for both. Pino Donaggio's score is top notch and the atmosphere of bleakness DePalma creates are the saving graces of this film. Even in the end, DePalma tries to pull the same trick he pulled in Carrie, by setting up cheap scares based on a nightmare the heroine of this movie (Miss Blake, played by a very gorgeous Nancy Allen)has. It's true that compared to films done today, Dressed To Kill plods thru like a mastodon caught in a swamp, but it's also true that many movies from that era still hold remarkably well and even have better directorial and story qualities. Dressed To Kill unfortunately tries to drag a 15 minute story way too long. Too little suspense, too little gore and only some decent skin-showing.

Other times it's to lighten things up after they'd been so darn serious. The first three 'Star Trek' movies aren't totally lacking in humor. For the next installment, it was about to cranked up a notch or two. Setting much of the film in 1980s North America should give some indication. Luckily, the balance between comedy and drama is pretty solid.Pros Fine performances. Another steady directing job by Nimoy. Story is a nice change of pace. Good score. Nice job on the effects. Great sense of humor. Pace just moves right along. Great cinematography. Leaves one with a good feeling.Cons Story is kind of silly. Hasn't aged well. Some effects haven't held up. Lacks the sense of danger of it's predecessors.Final thoughts As part of a trilogy of sorts, IV closes it up nicely. It's best to go in with an open mind since the tone is quite different. Had they gone overboard with the humor, the film wouldn't have worked so well. But once again the cast and crew, under the strong directing hand of Leonard Nimoy, have made magic.My rating 4\/5 ","genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"20 May 2012","score":"1 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Everyone has their own coming of age story, and many could probably peddle theirs on the big screen if they worked hard enough at it. Risky Business is one example of this age old theme, and a great one for exploring issues such as class conflict, peer pressure and parental expectations, all as they relate to the sexual awakening of a young upper middle class male.This is the movie that launched Tom Cruise's career, and its success is due in a large part to his great performance as the lead character, Joel Goodson. Joel is an earnest, hard working high school student who wants to do the right thing, but is also possessed with desires (aren't we all) and an intense curiosity about life beyond his well manicured front lawn. To help him explore these desires are three friends who all seem to be a little more experienced and less inhibited than himself. This appears to be the source of much of Joel's problems. Joel, in a nutshell, needs to prove to himself and the world that he is more than just a Goodson. Now one will note that right off the bat, Risky Business offers a little more than the usual coming of age fare. There is depth, style, good music and a carefully crafted mingling of dreamlike sequences with real life sequences. All of this serves to create the proper mood for the play out of Joel's inner conflicts. And the conflict that haunts Joel the most in the opening hour of the movie is the one between sex and success. The message If you pursue one, you will sacrifice the other. Among those hammering home this theme are Joel's parents who fear that one day, the egg they brought into the world will hatch into a bad egg. So what happens when they leave home for a three day weekend, leaving their big house in the suburbs all to Joel? Well, keep an eye on that egg....Joel is tempted, and the empty house soon becomes a playground for the play out of his fantasies. Egged on by his friends, he invites over Lana (Rebecca de Mornay), a beautiful and classy working girl from downtown who represents everything he desires. They have sex, but soon after the fantasy begins to spiral out of control. For one, Lana has friends, and they seem intent on taking over Joel's house. All of this means that Joel's future is now in jeopardy. The egg meanwhile disappears for a time and when it reappears, it now has a crack in it...OK, so now we have arrived at the nexus of the movie's message, and it is one that many have argued about over the years. Personally, I find it abhorant that anyone's life should be ruled by a credo that says that sex and a successful working life are mutually exclusive. This seems a problem unique to Joel. Yet Joel's solution to this problem is only one of many, and really, I mean, turning your folks house into a cathouse for a few days doesn't rank up there as one of the smartest decisions that a young man could make. But hey, Joel will never be the bad egg that his parents fear, and the risk he took COULD be seen as a sign that he possesses some qualities that will serve him well later in life. Is that why his misdeed lands him a spot at Princeton, and ONLY why? I don't really have a problem with the message, having faced similar circumstances in my own life a long time ago. Anyway, through it all, Joel maintains a sort of sheepish attitude, smiling his way through much of the movie. But he also gets scared when he's REALLY in trouble (i.e when it comes to Dad's car). Otherwise, he seems way too genuinely nice to be a bad egg. And also, he falls in love with Lana, the scheming working girl and business woman who strangely becomes his mentor, both sexual AND career wise. To me, it all works in a crazy sort of way. His sexual awakening is balanced and augmented by a tutoring in how to respect the power of money. Maybe Joel can have BOTH his sex and his success in life after all...thanks to Lana...?So, but there is even more to Risky Business than that. Consider the great, hypnotic music by Tangerine Dream,and some truly memorable dreamlike sequences including one on a subway late in the movie. All of this brought emotional impact to the movie in addition to the conflict and inner tension. It was enough to almost bring one to tears. So how can Joel's parents not be happy with the outcome of all this? Joel knows his place in life, and he has securely positioned himself for future success. And that he had this little adventure only broadened his horizons a little while provided him with one heck of a real life fantasy! In conclusion, all of this secured Risky Business's place as probably the best coming of age movie to come out of Hollywood in the 1980's. And it also served as a springboard for Tom Cruise, who was justly praised for making it all happen through Joel Goodson, the earnest and appealing high schooler, who deftly transformed his sexual fantasies into a great career move. Risky Business is aptly named, and should not be missed.
