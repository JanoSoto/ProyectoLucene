Ben Hur, and Sparticus springing most quickly to mind. Then the space age arrived, and sword & sandal epics became as passé as the western.Fortunately, Ridley Scott and a talented team of writers figured out a new way to breathe life in the old formula, with the help of CGI and a talented leading man. Frankly, the story of Maximus, a toppled Roman general who reclaims his political clout in the ring of gladiatorial combat, is a little thin when you think about it. But it's delivered with a lot of panache and visual flair.Russell Crowe isn't too multi-dimensional, but he's more than adequate in the role of Maximus, tender at times but more a gloomy muscleman. He's interesting, even brilliant in flashes, like when he finds the dead bodies of his wife and son, but he doesn't engage you enough to fret overmuch over his fate. Joaquin Phoenix delivers the best performance as the mad Roman emperor Commodus, vexed as he is by Maximus's reappearance but trying in his own sad way to be noble and loving. At times Phoenix seems to be channeling Malcolm McDowell, though not the time McDowell actually played an emperor in the nasty Caligula.Speaking of British film stars of the 1960s\/1970s, there are three of them in this film, Oliver Reed, Richard Harris, and David Hemmings, all of whom are now dead just four years after the picture's release. This amounts to something of a swan song for all of them, a fitting one as it turns out. Reed especially has his moments. Connie Nielsen presents us with both regal sexiness and hurt-stained eyes as Commodus's sister Lucilla, Maximus's former lover who clearly carries a torch still.We wait for Maximus and Lucilla to take up again where they left off, now that Maximus is single again, but the film reminds us time and again that Maximus's loyalty to his family extends beyond death, that he believes he will see them again in the afterlife. This spiritual dimension, unexpected from a film set in pagan times, lifts the film in my mind to the point where it really clicked with a lot of audiences. It also sets up Crowe's best bits of dialogue in the second half of the movie.Of course, there are some amazing fight scenes as well, in the Colisseum and other gladiator venues as well as Germania, where we are introduced to Maximus putting down a barbarian rebellion. The combat scenes are where the CGI work and other special effects especially shine, with a fight between Maximus and his cohorts against a squad of charioteers making for one heady adrenaline rush.But Maximus's followers are never adequately developed as people worth caring about. Also half-baked is some intrigue involving Lucilla and some Roman senators, including Derek Jacobi, who needs to be wearing a toga like Clint Eastwood does a cowboy hat. The crowd reactions to Maximus, especially when they suddenly recognize him en masse as the lost general who had never visited Rome and chant his name to spare him from Commodus's fury, cries out as obvious plot convenience. These aren't major flaws, but they do stick out on repeat viewings. 'Gladiator,' like many spectacles ancient and modern, never quite satisfies as well as it does the first time you see it.All in all, I have a hard time accepting this as the 2000 Best Picture Oscar winner, especially over Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, which is a more amazing feast for the senses and a better story besides. But 'Gladiator' is a good film, something more than your average blockbuster, and worthy watching.

It moves slowly and is badly photographed. The lighting makes too much use of neon blue, a popular fad around the time this appeared. The acting is okay, though, except for Ice Cube, who cannot seem to act. The score is routine. The script has two good things going for it.One is that the cops, though authoritarian in manner and attitude, are humanized without being sentimentalized. I'll give an example of what I mean by this. One scene, between Walsh and Ironsides, reveals to us and to Ironsides, that Walsh's cancer which had been though to be in remission has now metastasized and he's dying. Nothing much is made of the scene. Nobody breaks into tears. And Ironsides doesn't offer any false hope or, indeed try to comfort his friend in any way. He simply sits there and listens while Walsh, again without going into it, quietly talks about how he'd like to leave his family with a little something. The script and the director handle Walsh's death scene in the same understated way. Walsh's comrades try to revive him and finally give up. None of the assembled cops says anything. Cops wouldn't. But they are clearly moved by the passing of their friend. That's what I mean by humanizing them without sentimentalizing them.The second interesting thing about the film is that it dips a toe into some curious and seldom-dealt-with sociological waters. It brings up the question of primary allegiances. That is, to whom do we owe our main loyalty? Which group are we willing to make the most sacrifices for? Some groups are far more demanding of us than others. I may not care much about being a mailman, for instance, but I care an awful lot about being, say, an African-American mailman. Most ethnic groups are surrounded by clear social borders -- you're either one of us or you are not one of us. The same is true for some other groups -- doctors, airline pilots, U. S. Marines, and stunt men, to mention a few examples that I'm familiar with. Cops demand that kind of loyalty too. And here we have two minority members who find themselves working for the Sheriff's Office. Boatman is black and is a cop. Lori Petty is a woman (and a Jew, I think) and is a cop too. Which allegiance takes priority -- the allegiance to the minority group or to one's comrades on the police force? What happens when loyalties come into conflict?The film brings the question up but soon dumps it. Both rookies try to show their loyalty to their partners by hiding mistakes and so forth, but then they quickly return to the politically correct corners. Boatman realizes that he is black before he is blue. And why not? There's not a bad African-American to be seen. Petty undergoes a similar transformation.It's kind of a cheap way out. We can all feel satisfied now that our true identities have been found and all the corrupt and dissembling cops have been cleaned out. Sure.I wouldn't recommend this, really. The missed opportunities are wincingly obvious. It's rather overlong, too, and the story resembles Serpico. Even the title is second-hand. The Glass Shield. It sounds like a variation on the pop culture phrase, the glass ceiling, suggesting that the female cop, Lori Petty, will run into prejudices. (She does, but that has nothing to do with the plot.) The title also references other paradoxical titles like Steel Magnolias, Iron Butterfly, Led Zeppelin, Limp Biskit, The Glass Key. If it took more than five seconds to arrive at the title, the writers didn't deserve their paycheck.

First Joe Pesci is more a guest-star than anything, that's too bad. The guy who plays the wanna-be doctor is really bad, just like the other mostly-unknown actors, at least watching the movie Italian-dubbed.It's like a full-lengh sit-com turned crap, with some nice moment thanks to Pesci and Spades, and the granny at the end! That was cool!What I say is brilliant idea, horrible execution! Joe Pesci plays more of a though guy than I expected, that's wrong. He should have been an idiot-bad-guy like Home Alone's Harry! Not that!I hate this movie, so many thing went wrong. I can't even remember cause I just watched it twice. It was enough. I wasted 5 bucks!

Being an Adrien Brody fan, I was curious to see what Brody was like as a youth of 21 (20 when he filmed it, I suppose) in this early role as Danny Hemmerling, utility infielder for the California Angels (in the 1951 original, the hard-luck baseball team was the Pittsburgh Pirates. The name change is a nice touch, since it turns the title into wordplay). I decided to give the flick a chance, and it turned out to be a pretty painless, even amiable experience, with a decent balance of laughs, tears, sweetness, and baseball-based excitement. Also, my 7-year-old daughter liked the angel effects! -) Directed by Mike Nesmith's frequent collaborator William Dear, AitO is the story of Roger (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a foster child who prays real hard after his ne'er-do-well dad (the convincingly sleazy Dermot Mulroney) sarcastically says they'll be a family again once the last-place California Angels win the pennant. Soon Roger starts seeing real angels at the Angels' games, led by Christopher Lloyd, whose usual zany, eccentric irreverence keeps AitO from plummeting irretrievably into The Schmaltz Zone.  Crusty manager George Knox (Danny Glover in world-weary, exasperated mode) is a hard sell, but once the team starts winning, he believes Roger's angel sightings, and soon Knox has Roger and his cute li'l pal and fellow foster kid J.P. (the adorable Milton Davis Jr.) at every Angels game for good luck.  Knox even starts toning down his own temperamental outbursts and profane language, as much to appease the angels as for the kids' sake, resulting in a funny bit when he starts dressing down an umpire in his usual way but starts editing himself as he goes along.  Predictable obstacles ensue, such as obnoxious sportcaster Ranch Wilder (Jay O. Sanders) trying to make trouble for Knox because of the angel angle.  Sure, it all works out fine for our heroes in the end, but they're so darn amiable you don't mind! -)  Baby-faced Brody has a couple of good lines (I especially like his exchange with Glover about the emotional impact of the National Anthem at a ballgame) as well as a cute bit where a pretty blonde angel massages his shoulders before he goes up to bat.

I had just come back from a wonderful holiday in Ohio, USA and had never heard of this movie before. I just happened to flick to channel 4 and caught a glimpse of Morgan Freeman watching Tim Robbins make his entrance into Shawshank. I had missed the opening scene with the court case. My first impressions was that this was going to be a typical prison drama but I reached for the TV guide and read more about it. It starred Morgan Freeman who I remember from Along Came a Spider and Deep Impact and Tim Robbins who I have heard of but never seen on screen before. The TV guide gave it a good rating and review so I thought i might continue to watch it.In the opening scenes, I predicted possible rivalries between Andy and Heywood, however I was glad this was not the case as both characters became well-liked throughout the film. I even thought there would be tension between Andy and Red, but I was delighted that they became best friends throughout the movie. Along the way, I found the movie becoming interesting with many plots running alongside each other and beautiful photography. I held my breath when Hadley almost threw Andy off the roof and Morgan Freeman's story telling was first rate. Another scene that moved me was Andy playing the Mozart record and giving hope to all prisoners in Shawshank. I even went out to buy the fantastic soundtrack with the song as well as the superb score by Thomas Newman. I must say I was concerned when Andy got in trouble for that stunt, as I thought eventually the warden was going to help him solve his case. All the characters gave memorable performances and I was moved by Brooks taking his own life as he couldn't cope on the outside. I was shocked when Tommy revealed Andy's innocence and equally curious when the warden refused to help him. Nothing prepared me for the way Andy escaped, I was so glad he did but felt for Red at the same time. I was thrilled when Red got his parole and just hoped he didn't feel institutionalised like Brookes. I thought Red blew it when he talked up to the parole board but had a chuckle when he finally left Shawshank. Other moving scenes were Red reading Andy's letter and making his way through the fields surrounded with grasshoppers. The scene that took my breath away the most, was the shot of the bus as it made its way along the road with the brilliant sunlight, it looked just like the area where I had just come from in Ohio, as well as Red and Brookes in Main Street, Mansfield which I recognised. This film is long, but it certainly didn't seem that way to me, it is a movie you wish would go on for a bit more longer. I was stunned at the end, very moved, very happy and almost in tears. This film is truly a work of art, probably the finest movie ever made with superb acting from all of the characters, beautiful music, cinematography and so much better than the novel it is based on. I cannot believe it did not win any Oscars despite many nominations. It gives the viewer a sense of hope, happiness and satisfaction all in one and anyone can see this movie whatever mood they are in. The movie is also funny, who can forget Hadley with his, if I hear anything more than a mousefart... or Tommy explaining when he got arrested and had to drop a TV set. This movie makes you feel great to be alive and as Red says this movie is so beautiful it cannot be expressed in words. I bought the DVD for my family to watch and their stunned silence at end confirmed my suspicions that they loved this movie too.Shawshank Redemption is going to be re-released in the UK in September and I would encourage anyone who hasn't seen it before to go and see it and hopefully feel the same way I felt when I first saw this movie.

","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"15 June 2004","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  England needs an heir. Queen Catherine is as barren as a brick. Henry VIII falls for Anne Boleyn and needs to divorce his queen, but she is the aunt of the Holy Roman Emperor and the Pope cannot grant Henry's wish. Anne Boleyn falls pregnant, and Henry needs a divorce now. He rejects papal power in England and the Church of England is born. Henry and Anne are married in January 1533; Henry divorces Catherine the following May, insisting they were never married because she was once betrothed to his long dead brother, Arthur. In September, Elizabeth is born. So began the Anglican church, the Elizabethan era, the patronage of Shakespeare and the conflict between protestant England and Catholic Spain, culminating in the dispatch of their doomed Armada; for good measure, Elizabeth, the virgin queen, had two American states named after her. All because England needed an heir, or because Henry wanted Anne, or both.Behind the scenes of this drama is the story of lawyer Thomas More, who rose to become Chancellor of England (the king's closest advisor) then fell from grace because his conscience would not allow him to oppose the Pope, who was, to More, the link with St Peter and therefore with Christ Himself. This film is an examination of More's belief in his god as represented by the Pope. What it is not about is divorce. Thomas More did not object to the divorce so much as to the rejection of papal authority and the establishment of a rival church - albeit catholic - with the monarch as the head of the church in England. Henry, it should be noted, regarded himself as a catholic until the day he died.More's refusal to swear to an oath based upon the Act of Succession, and his eloquent legal and philosophical debates on and around the subject, form the basis of this staggering film. In the background, his family gradually lose their status and their wealth when More resigns the chancellorship and is imprisoned in the Tower (of London). It is when we hear of his reasons for refusing the oath, as explained to a King's Council, to his daughter and to the Duke of Norfolk, that we understand his absolute faith in his god and the depth of his love only God is love right through. We understand that although he is responsible for his family in this earthly realm, when it comes to their souls, they are on their own and must go where their own consciences take them we know that he would not perjure himself even to save their lives.This is an astonishing film. From the opening scenes, including Orson Welles's cameo, where the challenge to papal authority is explained, through More's confrontation with Robert Shaw's Henry VIII, to his imprisonment and trial, we are with the man for all seasons. We understand his predicament and we learn why he is regarded as a saint. Most of us know we are not made of such stuff as this, that we could not tolerate the imprisonment in the grimy, dank dungeon, then face execution for the want of the taking of an oath.Scofield's portrayal of More is one of the best performances in cinematic history and he delivers Robert Bolt's literate dialogue with the gravitas appropriate to the role. Robert Shaw, in his one scene, plays Henry like a kid in a candy store who needs help reaching the jar on the top shelf, only to be disappointed when he takes off the lid.    With actors like Wendy Hiller, John Hurt, Nigel Davenport, Susannah York, Leo McKern and Corin Redgrave in the other supporting roles we cannot claim any as standing out from the rest these are, each and every one, the most outstanding actors and each part has been perfectly cast. This amazing movie won half a dozen Oscars and deservedly so. It has withstood well the ravages of time and glows like a beacon in the wilderness as an example of how to write a spellbinding (screen)play, of how to direct a dialogue driven film and of how to bring to life the complexities and machinations of a middle ages court. It is a luxurious slice of cinema that will live for a long, long time. We are privileged to be able to watch films of such quality.

So began the Anglican church, the Elizabethan era, the patronage of Shakespeare and the conflict between protestant England and Catholic Spain, culminating in the dispatch of their doomed Armada; for good measure, Elizabeth, the virgin queen, had two American states named after her. All because England needed an heir, or because Henry wanted Anne, or both.Behind the scenes of this drama is the story of lawyer Thomas More, who rose to become Chancellor of England (the king's closest advisor) then fell from grace because his conscience would not allow him to oppose the Pope, who was, to More, the link with St Peter and therefore with Christ Himself. This film is an examination of More's belief in his god as represented by the Pope. What it is not about is divorce. Thomas More did not object to the divorce so much as to the rejection of papal authority and the establishment of a rival church - albeit catholic - with the monarch as the head of the church in England. Henry, it should be noted, regarded himself as a catholic until the day he died.More's refusal to swear to an oath based upon the Act of Succession, and his eloquent legal and philosophical debates on and around the subject, form the basis of this staggering film. In the background, his family gradually lose their status and their wealth when More resigns the chancellorship and is imprisoned in the Tower (of London). It is when we hear of his reasons for refusing the oath, as explained to a King's Council, to his daughter and to the Duke of Norfolk, that we understand his absolute faith in his god and the depth of his love only God is love right through. We understand that although he is responsible for his family in this earthly realm, when it comes to their souls, they are on their own and must go where their own consciences take them we know that he would not perjure himself even to save their lives.This is an astonishing film. From the opening scenes, including Orson Welles's cameo, where the challenge to papal authority is explained, through More's confrontation with Robert Shaw's Henry VIII, to his imprisonment and trial, we are with the man for all seasons. We understand his predicament and we learn why he is regarded as a saint. Most of us know we are not made of such stuff as this, that we could not tolerate the imprisonment in the grimy, dank dungeon, then face execution for the want of the taking of an oath.Scofield's portrayal of More is one of the best performances in cinematic history and he delivers Robert Bolt's literate dialogue with the gravitas appropriate to the role. Robert Shaw, in his one scene, plays Henry like a kid in a candy store who needs help reaching the jar on the top shelf, only to be disappointed when he takes off the lid.    With actors like Wendy Hiller, John Hurt, Nigel Davenport, Susannah York, Leo McKern and Corin Redgrave in the other supporting roles we cannot claim any as standing out from the rest these are, each and every one, the most outstanding actors and each part has been perfectly cast. This amazing movie won half a dozen Oscars and deservedly so. It has withstood well the ravages of time and glows like a beacon in the wilderness as an example of how to write a spellbinding (screen)play, of how to direct a dialogue driven film and of how to bring to life the complexities and machinations of a middle ages court. It is a luxurious slice of cinema that will live for a long, long time. We are privileged to be able to watch films of such quality.

That must have been famed horror director George A. Romero's pitch when he set out to make 'Monkey Shines'. I wonder why we haven't seen a sequel called 'Puppy Shines Too' where a sad-eyed golden retriever goes zonko and starts eating the neighbourhood kids. Maybe it's because this movie reeked of ape feces and a sequel was just not necessary. Even though there's a gut-level sympathy in seeing a man in a wheelchair, I found it hard to care about these blah characters. However, as long as Romero and his makeup whiz, Tom Savini, were able to give us some gruesome killings, we'd get to have some ghoulish fun, right? You KNOW the body count will be high with those names attached to a project, although the count is much lower than what we're accustomed to in Romero's zombie flicks. More death might have jazzed up this dud.Jason Beghe is Allan Mann, a buff track star who gets mowed down by a truck in the opening scene. Dr. Wiseman (Stanley Tucci) saves his life, but Mann can only move from the neck up. He's sullen, angry, even suicidal. Meanwhile, his friend, Geoffrey (Alan Pankow) is tinkering with monkey genetics (giving them shots of human tissue), then later gives Allan two presents a girl who trains primates to help humans and a girl who IS a primate. Ella---the talented monkey the filmmakers trained to perform some pretty amazing things---becomes fast friends with her new master. Allan perks up. However, the latent rage inside the trapped Mann must get out. Through some sort of wacky transferrence, the evil Ella hulks up for Allan and wreaks havoc on everyone in his life.The 'Net says the film's sub-heading is an experiment in fear. Whose fear? Certainly not mine. While the movie isn't funny, I laughed more than I shrieked (especially during the disappointing climax). Putting damsels in distress has always been the go-to move in horror movies. This time it's a man who can't defend himself. It's puzzling that a director who does menace so well would not be able to wring more tension out of scenes where a paralyzed man faces off against his wickedly brainy simian. Is there anybody more helpless than a quadriplegic? Rather, is there anybody who's more aware of his own helplessness than a man who can't move, yet still has 100% of his mind? But these psychological scenes add up to nothing and the movie clanks to a halt.Ella does what Allan can't, smiting his enemies. There's a little of Jekyll & Hyde, some 'Psycho' mother-son conflict, and even The Incredible Hulk angle is added into the mix. Ella is Allan's very own id, Hulk to his impotent Bruce Banner. Through their psychedelic connection, people (sometimes the wrong people) start to die. Confession the movie was interrupted by a few digital hits that scrambled my cable box for minutes at a time, then an annoying telemarketer disrupted my concentration during the climax. I guess I missed a few plot points and the comeuppance of 1 or 2 characters along the way, but don't worry...I'll be able to sleep tonight.

I wouldn't call it an excellent movie, but I wouldn't call it bad or average either. There was some very good aspects to this movie in my opinion, but the bad parts ruined most of the movie. So here's what I found good and what I found bad.I'll start by naming the aspects I found good in this movie. First, well, it's supposed to be a comedy, and I can't say I ever thought it was stupid or un-funny. Sure, it's not Monty Python. The jokes were sometimes a bit awkward, but generally it was pretty funny. Jack Black was specially funny in it. His character might have not been perfect, but he really brought him to life. I knew it was a teen movie and that it was labeled as an MTV film so I didn't expect too much from it. Anyone who saw this movie should have known it wasn't going to be a masterpiece. Personally, I found it very refreshing compared to most of the popular movies. For once the characters weren't a group of dumb teenagers trying to find a girl to sleep with or partying all the time. I also kind of liked the fact that this movie tells you that you don't need to go to college with intellectuals to become smart or to be successful in your life. I think that in a way, the movie's message was that being pretentious won't lead someone anywhere..But this leads me to one of the MAJOR disadvantage of this movie. It takes itself WAY too seriously and tries to pass messages. By example, through Jack Black's character, there's a serious anti-drug message that people tried to pass. By example, when they set the building on fire. For someone who notices these things easily, it can be very annoying and it can be seen as preachy, specially since it's supposed to be a carefree comedy.What's really strange is that even though it took itself very seriously, the movie was far from realistic. Even though I said I liked the message it seems to convey, I think this message is delivered in a very awkward way. The characters could have been developed a lot more, and the events of the movie aren't realistic at all. Since the movie takes itself seriously and tried to pass messages, there shouldn't have been such questionable elements. By example, there's Jack Black's character. He's always doped and completely selfish and loud at the begining of the movie. That's what was funny. After the second half of the movie, he becomes nice and wants to help his brother. That just seemed unlikely. The fact that the parents go back together is also pretty unlikely.. One of these elements alone would have been tolerable, since they're all possible.. But there was just so many things that were far fetched in the movie that it was impossible to think it was realistic. If the movie really wanted to be absurd and funny and unrealistic, it shouldn't have tried to convey such a serious message..

One prime example was Kill Bill Volume Two, where he thinks his dialogue is so good that he forgets that it's only good dialogue in a Tarantino fashion if it's funny, also. The same thing happened to True Romance. Often, Tarantino's writing is memorable, making his movies memorable and immortal. Although I'm behind on reviews, so I saw this movie a few weeks ago, I remember almost nothing from this film. There are some speeches characters give that could go down next to the Royale with Cheese sequence from Pulp Fiction, but, alas, they don't for a variety of reasons.Clarence (Christian Slater) is a typical loser. His boss hires prostitute Alabama (Patricia Arquette) to have sex with him on his birthday, and before they know it, they're married. Clarence kills her pimp (Gary Oldman), steals cocaine from him, and goes to Hollywood looking to sell it. The pimp's men go out to chase them. What an exciting story.I'm not going to blame it all on Tarantino. Much of the problem should be directed to director Tony Scott. You may remember him as being the one who took a possibility for a great movie called Man on Fire, chewed it up, spit it back out, and turned it into total crap. He shows more restraint here, making True Romance bearable and, at times, exciting. But nothing in it is memorable-the shootoff in Reservoir Dogs (which wasn't memorable per se) was more memorable. The characters weren't memorable, the scenes and speeches weren't memorable, and most of the movie wasn't memorable. I'm getting ahead of myself. I'm making True Romance out to be this awful movie. It really isn't.Some of the movie was interesting (for then), and there's a great scene between Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken. It doesn't resonate with me now, but as I was watching the movie, I was thinking how cool it was. While the characters weren't really defined much, they were acted well throughout. Samuel L. Jackson could have done more, though. Then again, Sam Jackson eating cottage cheese is exciting for me. But I digress. True Romance is nowhere near the potential Tarantino has, but if you watch it, you'll probably enjoy it. But don't think about it afterwards or you'll not like it as much.My rating 6\/10Rated R for violence, language, and drug use.

His father is (we are told) a brilliant inventor; Steven adores his mother and is adored in return. Steven's relatives include two genially crazy uncles, Danny and Arthur, who live together in an apartment across town. Precise diagnoses are never discussed and their behavior is seen from the point of view of a boy, but they both appear to have variants of schizophrenia, Danny being paranoid and Arthur more undifferentiated. Steven's almost blissful family life is cruelly interrupted when his mother becomes ill with cancer. Unhappy with his home life after the change, he 'runs away' to live with his uncles. Their apartment is a crowded archive of their mental illness. Steven is alternately fascinated and mortified by their bizarre behavior, but by sharing their world, he becomes a better person. This movie has no real plot or payoff, but it is captivating and moving. My upbringing was completely different from Steven's, but as a member of a Jewish family that has produced both some very bright people and some very crazy people, I can say that the film conveys the accuracy of 'felt life'. It is the antithesis of today's usual deadly conformist, formulaic and violence-ridden Hollywood films.Nathan Watt does a very good job as Steven. John Turturro as his father is part of the long and distinguished tradition in American film and television of Italians playing Jews (and vice versa); he's done it at least once before (Barton Fink). You can't help but see a bit of Cosmo Kramer in Michael Richards's performance as Danny. Best of all was Arthur as played by that shambling, rumpled Canadian bear Maury Chaikin. Most of the IMDb reviews rave about Andie MacDowell, but this Jewish reviewer feels that in fact she was woefully miscast as Steven's mother Selma; in her looks, her speech, her mannerisms, her body language, and her demeanor, she totally fails to convince as a New York Jewish woman.

Eh.Plot After getting out of jail and finding out that his brother died (glad to see Aykrod didn't ignore this fact) Elwood Blues once again finds himself in the world with no direction. Visiting the ophanage he and Jake saved in the last film, he is given a kid Buster (J. Evan Bonifant), to watch over for the day to keep him out of trouble. Of course if you saw the original that doesn't last long. Pretty soon he gains new partners Big Mack (John Goodman, in my opinion, making a great replacement to Jake.) and later Cab (Joe Morton) a police chief who was chasing him until the calling of the blood took over, and once again getting the band back together on yet another mission from God. Along with the Chicgo Police Department on his tale for a misunderstood kidnapping, as well as the mob and white power terroists.The problem with this film is that the music overshadows the story causing it to take a back seat and never really being given a chance to developed whereas the first movie blended both seemlessly. Granted  BB2000 never takes itself seriously as the first one did (even moreso with puppetry and special effects) and the music is really jamming here with musical talent new and old (gotta love the concert scene). But in the end the story just doesn't stack up to the original ending on something of a cliffhanger (guess there was a third on planned). Still, its it own movie. As the the title implies, a Blues Brothers for a new generation. If you don't compare it to its predecessor you MIGHT just enjoy it. Like I said I saw this before the first one and had no problems with it.Overall, a not so great story but still a pretty cool film. Worth a watch if you have nothing better to do.

Of course if you saw the original that doesn't last long. Pretty soon he gains new partners Big Mack (John Goodman, in my opinion, making a great replacement to Jake.) and later Cab (Joe Morton) a police chief who was chasing him until the calling of the blood took over, and once again getting the band back together on yet another mission from God. Along with the Chicgo Police Department on his tale for a misunderstood kidnapping, as well as the mob and white power terroists.The problem with this film is that the music overshadows the story causing it to take a back seat and never really being given a chance to developed whereas the first movie blended both seemlessly. Granted  BB2000 never takes itself seriously as the first one did (even moreso with puppetry and special effects) and the music is really jamming here with musical talent new and old (gotta love the concert scene). But in the end the story just doesn't stack up to the original ending on something of a cliffhanger (guess there was a third on planned). Still, its it own movie. As the the title implies, a Blues Brothers for a new generation. If you don't compare it to its predecessor you MIGHT just enjoy it. Like I said I saw this before the first one and had no problems with it.Overall, a not so great story but still a pretty cool film. Worth a watch if you have nothing better to do.

Initially, of course, this may appear rather irrational, but just because Gandhi and Malcolm X differed in their methods (at least as historians and filmmakers would have us believe) their ends and many of their attitudes were exactly the same.Both men believed in the dignity of their people (whether their was defined across racial or national lines makes little difference) and, consequently, both believed in their right to freedom, to liberty. Both served time in jail, both had religious revelations, or rather, so as not to insult their achievements, spiritual revelations. Malcolm X believed in separation of the black population from the white population, though he wanted blacks to retain and gain the same rights as the whites. Gandhi believed Indians should have sovereignty without British interference or control - and retain and gain rights denied to them by their colonial oppressors. Both Malcolm X and Gandhi were struck by social problems of their people, problems of poverty, hunger, degeneracy and loss of identity. This final problem occupied both Malcolm X's and Gandhi's philosophies. They recognized that foreign dominance over their people, i.e. English over Indian and white over black, inevitably led to an inculcation of inferiority in the minds of the subjugated people. In both cases it was institutionalized, socially and politically (not to mention economically). The blacks and the Indians were led to believe by their oppressors that not only were they not capable of having sovereignty, freedom and the rights their oppressors enjoyed, but even if they were, they were not worthy of them. Gandhi and Malcolm X both recognized this problem and tried to resolve it.However, while both men fought to achieve similar goals, they differed in their means. Malcolm X advocated active resistance against the people he hated the white oppressors. He was not afraid to say so - and employed the very racism that was meant to keep blacks down against the whites. He vehemently opposed the choice of many blacks to strive to gain rights within the existing system. Consequently he opposed people like Martin Luther King Jr. who, Malcolm X felt, pandered to the whites and made them all-too-comfortable. He, like Gandhi, fought for the dignity of his people and he made it very clear as to what this fight entailed.Gandhi's approach is now famously described as nonviolent resistance. While at first, this may seem too much like the methods of Martin Luther King Jr. of whom Malcolm X had a low opinion, Gandhi's nonviolence had little to do with negotiation and speech-making. The operative word is resistance and Gandhi inspired the Indian people to resist - and what makes Gandhi such an awe-inspiring figure, no doubt an inspiration for an epic film, is his innovativeness in not betraying his nonviolent, peaceful spirit in achieving Indian independence. From the emphasis on economic self-reliance, examples of which include cloth-weaving and illegal salt-making, to self-respect and respect and love for one's enemy, Gandhi's method was not only practical in the sense of economics, but also spiritual in terms of legitimating the goals and desires of the Indian people in the eyes of the British colonialists and, most importantly, in the eyes of the Indians themselves.Both Gandhi and Malcolm X were assassinated not by their oppressors, but rather, by extremist members of groups to which they also belonged they died as a result of internal politics and internal dissent.Malcolm X did not exactly achieve a separate black state, or (even less so) a return to the traditional ways of African blacks, to the roots of African-Americans. He did not solve the social problems of blacks, especially in urban areas. Gandhi inspired his people to win Indian independence, but he also did not resolve impending social and ethnic dilemmas that erupted shortly after independence was achieved.However, the world speaks more comfortably and openly about Gandhi than Malcolm X. No doubt, part of that stems from the fact that Gandhi's fight had a much larger scope literally - he occupied world attention. But, it would be wrong to deny that many people, historians among them, choose to put less emphasis on Malcolm X than, say, Martin Luther King Jr. because the former attempted to fight for rights more actively than other civil rights activists. Who's to say he was wrong? Nobody. How do we judge men like Gandhi and Malcolm X? The reason I decided to compare the two films is not only because of the shared similarities in the characters they portray. I also chose the two films because of their portrayal Richard Attenborough shows us Gandhi, like Spike Lee shows us Malcolm X, without compromises and judgments.In Gandhi Attenborough, through the phenomenal (and I mean Phenomenal) Ben Kingsley, captures the beautiful spiritual clarity with which Gandhi spoke and, furthermore, which he embodied in his actions. The film does not vilify the British colonialists any more than their actions vilify them - it presents and it invites the viewer to judge. It is flawlessly directed and it is one of the few great epics ever made. It obsesses to perfection about whom it is about. In that it is comparable to the passionate portrayal of Malcolm X in Spike Lee's film. However, while Malcolm X ends with an unfortunate false note of social importance, Gandhi transcends preaching and forced social commentary.And, most importantly, Gandhi reminds us of people who come and go, who love humanity and are not afraid to fight for it on their terms. It reminds us of people whose vision of existence is not stale and full of the empty words of politicians, but instead spiritual and moral clarity. One only has to watch Gandhi's self-confidence in argument with the various British soldiers and politicians he meets - he doesn't have to prattle and propagandize. He has discovered truth and it gives him comfort, strength and confidence - he lets it speak for him. This clarity is something many of us thirst for every day - and Gandhi reminds us that it is achievable.
