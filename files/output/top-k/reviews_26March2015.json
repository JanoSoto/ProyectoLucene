I felt as I watched just why do so many love it, I didn't think it was perfection but there is no doubt this is an interesting piece of cinema with it's smart plot and emotionally charged characters. I did feel it was very good and although only just about, it still manages to really let you enjoy it.The first thing to say about this is Robin Williams who is at his very best here. He just feels so excellent as his role as Sean Maguire who as you will see councils Will Hunting and he adds an extra element to this movie Robin does. All the cast are fairly strong here, Matt Damon as Will is good and really shows us what he has got for his future film career. Cast such as Ben Affleck aren't really shown as much as the two I mentioned but him among his brother Casey Affleck, Minnie Driver and Stellan Skarsgard form a good little cast for this type of film. Ben Affleck and Matt Damon of course write the movie and they do a great job, not only capturing everyday life situations well, but adding in Will Hunting to those scenes to make it feel smart and funny. I did however feel it was slightly contrived, mostly in the way they want to get a certain emotion out of you, sometimes you can laugh and sometimes you can be sad, even times when they want you to think Oh wow he's smart that Will Hunting. I will also add that the script though is really showcasing the talent these two guys have, and I do feel like these guys really are an example to look up to when aspiring screenwriters come up.Gus Van Sant directs it well and his job is made easier by the fine script brought to him. He manages to delicately direct it without making the film feel done before or too much like a typical piece of cinema. Van Sant also could be said to contribute to Williams performance and you can see Gus really worked well with the cast to make them bring the most out of the script. Another delicate thing is the score, now when you making a film about a genius from Boston, Danny Elfman doesn't always spring to mind but he manages to beautifully score it and the music is really one thing I remember the most about watching the movie.One good thing about the movie is that it is smart, not only in movie terms but in terms of the script and the actors who all seem to remember there lines so well, it almost feels like they all know mathematics like we see in the film. I think all the credit goes to Affleck and Damon who if I'm not mistaken, are not mathematic geniuses but do the screenplay in such a way that it feels like a professor has written parts of the film.Overall it is the ending that is the real pay off, of course I'm not going to ruin it for you but lets just say it makes you feel emotion and really draws you close to the characters we see so much of in this movie. Overall this is totally worth a watch, not only for people thinking It's Oscar nominated, it must be good, but also people who just want an interesting film, not for those who want action or true thrills but it is definitely one for the thinkers and maybe even the unidentified genius.

From the get go Tarzan will have you wide eyed and waiting to see what will happen next. The opening sequence is one of the most impressive I have ever seen in film. The opening sequence is just so powerful as it shows the contrast of the human family (infant Tarzan with his parents) and the gorilla family living happily before tragedy strikes both families which leads Kala to finding the baby Tarzan. All done without dialog, all done with the great song Two Worlds in the background.Changing Tarzan's adoptive family to gorillas worked well because it showed a more gentle side to these great apes, which are often depicted as savage bruits in such films as King Kong and Planet of the apes. Tony Goldwyn did a great job as Tarzan; he hit the right balance of fun loving, relaxed and also emotional when it was required. However, Glen Close gave a soft, angelic voice to Kala that only a mother could have and her bond with both the child and adult Tarzan was at the emotional soul of the film. This was contradicted perfectly by Henriksen's performance as the un-accepting and judgmental ape leader Kurchack. Jane, Tantor, Turk were all great characters that all did well with adding humor at the appropriate times and what I liked about Driver's performance was that she was neither the defiant heroine nor the damsel in distress but rather she was simply a girl who had come to an untamed land and became enchanted with the world of a man she would later fall in love with. I would even go as far as to say that Jane is one of Disney's best female leads.I also give the movie points for the animations, most adaptations would have Tarzan swinging through the trees, but here he actually surfs through the trees.However, I do feel that the villain (voiced by Brian Blessed) was slightly weak in comparison to other characters, Clayton is not very interesting in terms of motivation but I do feel he could have been more unique if he had been made to look younger, I would have preferred to see him have the looks of say John Smith from Pocahontas, he just seemed quite forgettable but held up in the film's final third. I also feel the film would have been more effective if Sabor was given a speaking part. Simply having the leopard growl and roar seemed to make him a brainless carnivore as opposed to an enemy and in my humble opinion Sabor would have been more intimidating if the had a speaking role to match his ferocity.The film's strongest point was it's music and Phil Collins and Mark Mancina joined forces to create one of the greatest soundtracks I have heard in a very long time. With the exception of Trashing the camp which was sung by Turk, Collins used his actual voice for all of the songs and tunes such as Son of Man or Strangers like me or the Oscar winning You'll be in my heart will all go down as classics and give the film for being original and not sticking to the traditional musical tone.As one of the final traditionally animated films to be considered a hit, and is probably the greatest depiction of the story of Tarzan ever put on the big screen.

Some might not understand that but in watching it again recently I really watched it and I completely understand why it endears itself so much to us. This film defines the 80's the way other films have before it like The Graduate or Casablanca. Sound hard to believe comparing it to those films? The 80's was a decade of pomp and success and flashy...everything...and even now when we look back that's how we remember it and Ferris Bueller's Day Off proves that this is what we all wanted life to be like. The film is funny, sad, expressive and wild. The legend of teenage angst and modern day classics John Hughes had to know he was truly hitting his mark with this one. You could (and people do) quote it for ages and it still holds its own even today and is just as entertaining and silly and yet really effective as it was then. This film is about freedom and growing up and bucking responsibility...it is an homage to being a teenager and we all wanted to be Ferris Bueller or be his best friend because everyone was either a Ferris or a Cameron.As often happened with John Hughes films the man knew how to score a great cast. His plots and scripts seem to simple and yet they are easily some of the most memorable films. Matthew Broderick gives an absolutely stunningly charismatic performance as Ferris Bueller. He breaks the fourth wall to narrate his own life. He's popular and well known and has clearly had some wild adventures before. Hughes manages to really make us understand Bueller before we go on this day with him. Broderick is perfect. Alan Ruck is his perfect counterpart. Cameron is neurotic, scared, anxious and desperately needs Ferris' help to break free. They have good chemistry together and they are the perfect balance. Mia Sara is the lovely girlfriend to Ferris. Sara is mostly eye candy and she is beautiful but she doesn't really stand out amongst the cast. She has a purpose and she fulfilled it. Jennifer Grey is absolutely fantastic as Ferris' terminally angry sister trying to stop Ferris in his tracks. She is sort of the villain and yet you can't help but love to hate her. The supporting cast of the film are all very good too including Jeffrey Jones, Edie McClurg and Charlie Sheen in a legendary cameo role.What can I really say about John Hughes as a director that hasn't already been said. He just simply had this absolutely magical talent at telling stories that you felt like you were a part of. It doesn't matter how improbably you are right there with his characters and you never forget them. He is an amazing writer and he is absolutely the exception to the rule that writer's don't usually translate to directors very well because no one knows his vision like he does. He probably has more classics and memorable films to his credit than most other directors. Most of all John Hughes' films are just fun and Ferris Bueller's Day Off is just simple fun. Its not intense and it doesn't make you think really, its just fun and a wild time and the perfect definitive 80's film. Whether its the product placement or the characters or the clothing...its a must see from the 80's generation. 9\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"26 March 2015","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" For anyone who grew up in or even around the 80's...this film is a classic period.

He breaks the fourth wall to narrate his own life. He's popular and well known and has clearly had some wild adventures before. Hughes manages to really make us understand Bueller before we go on this day with him. Broderick is perfect. Alan Ruck is his perfect counterpart. Cameron is neurotic, scared, anxious and desperately needs Ferris' help to break free. They have good chemistry together and they are the perfect balance. Mia Sara is the lovely girlfriend to Ferris. Sara is mostly eye candy and she is beautiful but she doesn't really stand out amongst the cast. She has a purpose and she fulfilled it. Jennifer Grey is absolutely fantastic as Ferris' terminally angry sister trying to stop Ferris in his tracks. She is sort of the villain and yet you can't help but love to hate her. The supporting cast of the film are all very good too including Jeffrey Jones, Edie McClurg and Charlie Sheen in a legendary cameo role.What can I really say about John Hughes as a director that hasn't already been said. He just simply had this absolutely magical talent at telling stories that you felt like you were a part of. It doesn't matter how improbably you are right there with his characters and you never forget them. He is an amazing writer and he is absolutely the exception to the rule that writer's don't usually translate to directors very well because no one knows his vision like he does. He probably has more classics and memorable films to his credit than most other directors. Most of all John Hughes' films are just fun and Ferris Bueller's Day Off is just simple fun. Its not intense and it doesn't make you think really, its just fun and a wild time and the perfect definitive 80's film. Whether its the product placement or the characters or the clothing...its a must see from the 80's generation. 9\/10 ","genre":"Comedy"},{"date":"26 March 2015","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" For anyone who grew up in or even around the 80's...this film is a classic period. Some might not understand that but in watching it again recently I really watched it and I completely understand why it endears itself so much to us. This film defines the 80's the way other films have before it like The Graduate or Casablanca. Sound hard to believe comparing it to those films? The 80's was a decade of pomp and success and flashy...everything...and even now when we look back that's how we remember it and Ferris Bueller's Day Off proves that this is what we all wanted life to be like. The film is funny, sad, expressive and wild. The legend of teenage angst and modern day classics John Hughes had to know he was truly hitting his mark with this one. You could (and people do) quote it for ages and it still holds its own even today and is just as entertaining and silly and yet really effective as it was then.

John Kani was good in his role as Samuel and reminded me a bit of Rafiki from The Lion King in that wise adviser role\/ comic relief.

Christiane's face was horribly disfigured following a car accident, and following her funeral, we realize she is still living under the care of her father, with a plain, white mask over her face. Her father, who owns his own clinic right next door to their home, is trying to restore the beauty of Christiane's face by sending his assistant to find and befriend young, attractive women so that they can be kidnapped, taken to his clinic, and stripped of their own face to be surgically placed on Christiane's. One day, Louise finds Edna Grüber (Juliette Mayniel), an attractive, young Parisian woman who looks to be a perfect match for Christiane. Upon drugging her and taking her back to Génessier's home, the process of stripping Edna of her face and applying it to Christiane's begins in a horribly gruesome way.From that premise alone, many potential viewers of Eyes Without a Face will be turned off and never look in the film's direction again. What they'll fail to see, however, is how remarkably beautiful of a film this is. Despite its grotesque premise, director Georges Franju keeps the film on a quiet scale, conducting everything in a softly poetic manner, relying on the essences provided by Eugen Schüfftan's black and white cinematography to carry the film. This atmosphere makes the film a decidedly artful venture, showcasing the lavish scenery and costume designs of those involved rather than making the film entirely about shock and awe.Admittedly, there is gruesomeness to be found in Eyes Without a Face, and the level in which it's employed is pretty strong, especially given the time period in which it was made. Franju handles the gore in a way that makes the film more about the process than the actual shock; with such a frightening and depraved premise, one expects the film to be filled to the brim with completely nonsensical ugliness and gross-out schtick. Thankfully, the driving force behind the film knows how he wants everything to be executed, and that's not in the way of bargain basement shock. Franju creates an impact that's potentially everlasting on the viewer, creating a film that's equal parts carefully-executed French drama and classic American monster movie.I liken Franju's film to an American monster film not only because of its atmosphere, but its buildup and execution. At only ninety-minutes, Eyes Without a Face is conservative in its narrative pacing and relatively slowburn in its structure. Franju hooks us early on by painting the picture of a clearly intelligent and thoughtful doctor, but one who is also not mentally stable. We then see Franju change gears to give his daughter's perspective on her treatment, living a now secret life confined to a white mask and her father's clinic, struggling to keep her own mental stability. Then we cut to Louise's manipulative, thankless task, and so on; Franju structures the film in layers, giving us suspense before providing us with an execution similar to a monster movie. We get a lot of tension before the instance we've been waiting for finally occurs, and through that, the same kind of emotions and feelings arise.Eyes Without a Face comes at the pivotal time in French cinema when a new wave was underway. The longstanding tradition of quality, where older directors made films for an older crowd, reiterating common values and traditionalist principles, was being demolished by younger, more radical directors who were motivated by watching a great deal of subversive films from all over the world and wanted to profile the kind of ideas they beared and they felt. These ideas were often politically-charged (a great deal of the 1960's work of Jean-Luc Godard), autobiographical works (several early works of François Truffaut), and films that simply broke every convention in French cinema at the time (specifically Godard's Breathless). Franju previously was a documentarian, making films concerning Paris industry, one about a slaughterhouse and another about the modernization of the city. Eyes Without a Face was his first film to deviate from his forte, and what amounted as a result was a great deal of critical indecisiveness about what kind of path Franju was attempting to forge with this new direction. Despite all of the criticism he received, Franju responded quaintly, saying the purpose was to give simple genre films like this some credibility, showing that they can break new ground and give us something to talk about just as much as any documentary could.Eyes Without a Face is a masterclass of suspense and terror, and remains a revolutionary work of not only French horror, but French cinema in general.Starring Pierre Brasseur, Edith Scob, Alida Valli, and Juliette Mayniel.

Stanley Kubrick's 84-minute labyrinthine thriller transports the moral contortions of film noir to the overwrought atmosphere of the race-track, suffusing them together with dread-inducing temporal uncertainty. The Killing is a story of a group of low-level hoods that hops around a heist at a race track, viewing the events from the perspective of the men involved. Johnny Clay (Sterling Hayden, competently thumping a restrained characterization), just released from a 5-year stint in prison, instigates the operation, recruiting inside men from the track like bartender Mike, book-keeper Marvin, and clerk George (Elisha Cook, a particular standout), along with corrupt policeman Randy Kennan to orchestrate the daring heist. Each represents a specific role in the intricate process, a key piece to the overall puzzle which is deliberated over through clandestine meetings. Our unlikely schemers all believe their newly acquired riches will salvage whatever opportunities they've previously squandered. But as in most film noir, here too a dame holds the key to doom. The weak-willed George naively believes the money will satisfy his wide-eyed viper of a wife, Sherry (spectacularly portrayed by Marie Windsor). Her passive-aggressive interrogations are ripe with assaults on George's nonexistent masculinity, and what begins as idle pillow talk quickly avalanches into full-blown disaster. Overall the plot works like clock-work; drawing us into the scheme and then milking the pleasures of witnessing it unfold exactly as planned. Well almost! The movie soon settles into a thrilling vein culminating into an unexpected and brutally ironic climax as the group's hard-earned cash literally blows away - a compelling image of great symbolic value that visually mirrors early images of the racetrack grounds littered with losing tickets. Kubrick holds the image for maximum impact, and the look on Hayden's face is a deft summary of film noir's intrinsic fatalism all are doomed, and the only question is how.It is a tremendous pleasure to see how it all unfolds, largely because Kubrick directs it with the skill of a consummate pro (despite being all of 27 years old then). Kubrick's structuring of the material makes it a brisk film noir, moving us around the narrative like an unassembled jigsaw puzzle that slowly but surely comes together in the end, but never in the way we might expect it.

Overall the plot works like clock-work; drawing us into the scheme and then milking the pleasures of witnessing it unfold exactly as planned. Well almost! The movie soon settles into a thrilling vein culminating into an unexpected and brutally ironic climax as the group's hard-earned cash literally blows away - a compelling image of great symbolic value that visually mirrors early images of the racetrack grounds littered with losing tickets. Kubrick holds the image for maximum impact, and the look on Hayden's face is a deft summary of film noir's intrinsic fatalism all are doomed, and the only question is how.It is a tremendous pleasure to see how it all unfolds, largely because Kubrick directs it with the skill of a consummate pro (despite being all of 27 years old then). Kubrick's structuring of the material makes it a brisk film noir, moving us around the narrative like an unassembled jigsaw puzzle that slowly but surely comes together in the end, but never in the way we might expect it. And by doing so, he propels the acidic realm of film noir into something even darker!

The story is generic, the acting is generally terrible, the sets are fun, the score is pretty silly with its hilariously bad rock segments, etc. For me this is a prime example of the old So bad it's good saying. It's a movie that has a great deal of imperfections, but still manages to entertain from beginning to end.This is a movie that clearly knows it isn't trying to be anything more than what it is.

All of it pushes her to go for her dreams.Lobster has never been sexier. Cynthia Rhodes does a crazy dance and so does Beals' body double. They are all iconic dance scenes. There are some great 80s music. The movie screams 80s cheese but it's even better than that. There are some great scenes. Jeanie's progression is heart breaking. The older dancer (I believe it's Belinda Bauer) does a great speech about dreams fading away. This is not just good 80s cheese. It also has heart.
