Can you say Beam me up, Scotty?Star Trek parodies have been with us since at least the 1960s, when MAD magazine did several while the series still ran on NBC. Galaxy Quest uses the behind-the-scenes legend of Trek (how lead actor William Shatner was hated by cast mates, for example), as well as its passionate, nerdy fan base, to develop a deftly layered parody that works better for viewers knowing something about the real-life Trek going in.At the start of the many good things to be said for Galaxy Quest is Allen, once again (as with Toy Story and The Santa Clause) playing a character bringing life to another's fantasy in a case of mistaken identity.

Allen communicates deeper emotions, too, at Nesmith's sad shambles of a career and the prospect of letting the Thermians down.Providing farcical counterpoint to Allen's layered performance are Sigourney Weaver and Alan Rickman as cast mates. It's odd that sitcom actor Allen does the heavy dramatic lifting here while the theatrically more accomplished Rickman and Weaver kick back and goof around. But it works. Weaver has more fun in this film than I've ever seen from her, as a blonde Uhura resenting the attention her cleavage gets but still wanting her close-ups. Rickman plays a Spock-like role of an alien that forces him to wear a rubber skullcap for the whole film, glowering at the misery of his singularly lame catchphrase and of always playing second-fiddle to Taggart, even later when it's for real.It's always about you, isn't it! he screams as Taggart is about to be devoured by an alien horde.There are other characters with Trek-echoes, none more entertaining than Sam Rockwell's Guy. As an actor, Guy appeared only briefly on one GQ program. Now, brought along on this fantastic voyage, he sees himself about to endure a similar fate I'm expendable! I'm the guy in the red suit who dies to prove the situation's serious.It's fun to see this and other Trek conventions, including the conventions themselves, sent up by the underemployed but able director Dean Parisot with such affection and wit. The adventure elements come off a bit too powerful at times to handle the delicate suspension of disbelief; the ending wrapped too tightly in a bow. But Galaxy Quest is fine entertainment, smart and empathetic, no doubt the best Star Trek movie never made.

Movies during the summer don't depend themselves much on smart, clever situations and characters, and SPEED 2 CRUISE CONTROL is no exception. This maybe it's year's dumbest action flick, with everything happening implausible overdrive. Yes, it is dumb, but when it comes to its action sequences and tight pacing, SPEED 2 is a could-be-worse summer fun, as long as audiences expect less than more from the writer's intelligence. Having said that, the movie does have its share of huge problems and plot holes that could sink the Titanic. Instead of a traveling Los Angeles bus, SPEED 2 takes the danger to a Caribbean cruise liner. Sandra Bullock returns to her lovable role of Annie Porter from the first SPEED, with much less to do, rather than the usual damsel-in-distress behavior. She goes with her boyfriend Alex (Jason Patric), an LAPD, lacking the heroic charm of Keanu Reeves' Jack Traven role, on a Caribbean cruise on board the Seaborn Legend. Unlucky for them, and for the other passengers, to board a ship with John Geiger (Willem Dafoe) on board. See, he's a crazed computer engineer with vengeance, after being fired when he gets a certain ailment, he believes, came from a technical malfunction of the ship, which he helped control. After he takes over the ship, he sends it speeding towards an oil tanker at a rush. This gives time for Patric to flex his action muscles, while also giving Bullock a chance to say her distressful dialogs like I swear, I'm never leaving the house again!.Director Jan De Bont is back on the fast lane (if i may say so) directing this sequel to his summer hit. This time, though, he doesn't do very great job, unlike that he did for the first film. De Bont uses a lot of the Shakycam, shots that follow the action sequences, but gives the viewer a dizzy feeling. He gives these treatments, even to moments that don't require them. The plot, of course, is highly preposterous and implausible. Firstly, no ship moves at an incredibly fast like how it was pointed out in the story. Once more, we also get a dull dose of characters, a lot less colorful and busy like the ones in SPEED. The film loses a lot, basically, from the lack of Keanu Reeves' character, and Patric's isn't much of a good replacement. Bullock's role here isn't quite as charming as how she did the character in the first film. The only character that has much dimension is Dafoe's Geiger, but he seems way too over-the-top to be any plausible than a comic book villain.Nevertheless, despite all the flaws, SPEED 2 manages to make a thrill ride of itself. The special-effects take on a life of its own during the film's better action sequences. My favorite, is the ship's collision with the giant oil tanker, which is where the bigger-budgeted effects are best observed. De Bont, despite his tired and uninspired direction, manages to produce a couple of good moments.Perhaps as long as the audience doesn't think even once the moment the theater lights have dimmed, SPEED 2 CRUISE CONTROL might be worth a look, but with so many flaws and gaps in reality, it doesn't even come close to what it could have been. Stick to the original; at least Keanu Reeves was smart enough to do that. Rating ** out of 5.

I am guessing its years of rarity on home video was a direct result of the backlash incurred during production and after its release (something well-recollected on the new DVD). It's a shame, since Cruising is ultimately one of Friedkin's best films--combining a hard-hitting cop thriller with a mist of documentary realism, an aura of psychological depth, and a strong lead performance from Al Pacino. A serial killer is prowling the leather bars of New York City, murdering homosexuals; Sergeant Edelstein (Paul Sorvino) enlists patrolman Steve Burns (Pacino) to immerse himself in the gay subculture to weed out the culprit. Friedkin captures the scuzz-pit grunge of NYC at the time with much affection, and films the leather-bar scenes with a peering, objective eye that hits a tone more surreal than exploitative; he is admirably forthright in presenting the lifestyle as it existed then, and is not beyond pushing limits (though it should be said he uses skillful cuts to imply more than what is actually shown). The thriller aspect of Cruising works quite well--almost invoking the feel of Dario Argento's gialli at times--and Friedkin stages several intensely uncomfortable scenes that veer away from sensationalism and remain in service to the story. Under the surface, Cruising is about identity, and the psychology of Pacino's character indeed rests on an ambiguous note that is very intriguing. While some elements of the film--including a thong-wearing black guy who slaps around a suspect during an interrogation (played for comic relief, it seems), and the use of several different actors to portray the killer (more unfair than clever)--fall flat, Cruising is an overall success. Considering how the few gay-themed thrillers that emerged in its wake (though I can only think of the dreadful 1986 slasher City in Panic) handled homosexuality ineptly or offensively makes Cruising a prime candidate for re-appraisal.

Sam Neilson returning to his role as Alan Grant is definitely a treat, and most of the other actors in the film do a fair job at their respective rolls as well. As is expected from the franchise, the dinosaur CGI looks fantastic (though it still lacks that certain edge that T-Rex scene in the first movie had. Fellow fans will know what I'm talking about,) and there are plentiful scares to be had from the dinosaur islands more voracious inhabitants. Unfortunately however, this is where the good of the movie ends, and the bad starts to begin.The film opens with a man and a young boy going para sailing (at least I think that's what it's called.

As you might expect, something goes wrong, the father and son crash on the island, and the game is afoot.To sum up the following events for you, the boys mother and divorced former father hire Alan Grant, under the fake pretext that they're owners of a major corporation just wanting to go on a tour of Dinoland, to be their guide of the islands habitat (so they can find their lost son.) Alan takes his ward with him, I don't even remember his name (you won't either) and before long the whole bunch is on a flight into the bowels of hell itself. Needless to say, things go the way of a T-Rex turd pretty much after the plane lands on the islands moss covered runway, with half the professional mercenaries hired with them dead in ten minutes and everyone is running for their lives.

Way to be realistic there, Mr. Spielberg. On top of that, the ordeal of fearing for their sons life brings the divorced parents back together (cheese. Alans ward is carried away by a murderous tyranodon and is found alive with only a few cuts at the end of the film (super cheese). And to top it off, the marines and half the navy come in just to save the little group right at the end (uber cheese.) The murderous nature that made the velociraptors movie staples in the last two films is pretty has the edge filed down in this film, all in a almost-corny effort to make them seem smart. Like Lost World, which tried to promote the idea of dinosaurs being caring parents at the films expense, this film tries to push the idea that raptors were geniuses in dinosaur terms (they weren't, by the way. Most raptors weren't much smarter than a wolf.) The end result is just an unfair robbing of what made the raptors scary in the first place. That cold, merciless nature of theirs.JPIII is a competent film, and you can see there were a few good ideas thrown in, but in the end, without any inspiration from one of Crichton's actual novels, the story falls flat. It's nice to see some flying Dino's and the Spinosaur is a competent villain (though not nearly as scary as Rex,) but other than that, I really wouldn't recommend this film as a must see.

This tradition goes back as far as Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan novels (Mr. Burroughs also wrote the original Lost World, interestingly), can be seen in more recent series like Jaws, and makes it's presence known in the modern day with the seemingly endless Saw movies.Jurassic Park III does not break from this tired and true money making ideal, but in it's defense it does aim a little higher than many of its fellow putrid III movies. Sam Neilson returning to his role as Alan Grant is definitely a treat, and most of the other actors in the film do a fair job at their respective rolls as well. As is expected from the franchise, the dinosaur CGI looks fantastic (though it still lacks that certain edge that T-Rex scene in the first movie had. Fellow fans will know what I'm talking about,) and there are plentiful scares to be had from the dinosaur islands more voracious inhabitants. Unfortunately however, this is where the good of the movie ends, and the bad starts to begin.The film opens with a man and a young boy going para sailing (at least I think that's what it's called. It involves a boat, a rope, and a glider, so forgive me if I called it wrong) over a beautiful sea with a tropical island in the backdrop. Can you guess where this is going? Yep, that island is none other than Isla Sorna, Site B itself. What this guy is doing taking his son para sailing next to one of the most dangerous islands on earth is beyond me, and it's one of the weak points in the plot. Which is bad, considering its the frigging OPENING of the plot. As you might expect, something goes wrong, the father and son crash on the island, and the game is afoot.To sum up the following events for you, the boys mother and divorced former father hire Alan Grant, under the fake pretext that they're owners of a major corporation just wanting to go on a tour of Dinoland, to be their guide of the islands habitat (so they can find their lost son.) Alan takes his ward with him, I don't even remember his name (you won't either) and before long the whole bunch is on a flight into the bowels of hell itself. Needless to say, things go the way of a T-Rex turd pretty much after the plane lands on the islands moss covered runway, with half the professional mercenaries hired with them dead in ten minutes and everyone is running for their lives.

He could take a light script and, with the right casting and editing, put a twinkle in it and make it shine like a star. This particular star may not be the brightest in the sky as great romances go, but it is definitely one that keeps you tuned in to the end. You really want to know how things are going to work out.The script is perfect for Cybill Shepherd, who at the time needed to capitalize on her Moonlighting success for the new generation who was (fortunately for her) probably unaware of how many big screen major duds she had after a very promising start. In this film she's every bit back in form as a still-pining widow living vicariously through her daughter (Mary Stuart Masterson on the cusp of stardom which would peak with Fried Green Tomatoes two years later). She may have looked too young for the role, but that works well for the way the story unfolds. This is her film, but she doesn't overstep her bounds as a lead.SHepherd graciously allows Robert Downey Jr. to carry much of the film and shows a more mature comic flair than he had in his previous films to that point. And there's ample support from Ryan O'Neal (in his best role in years) and Christopher MacDonald. Masterson's natural charm pretty much coasts on its own, either that or she has a way of making her character seem like a breath of fresh air with every word.Ardolino makes good use of his cast's sex appeal the same way he did with Dirty Dancing, but this film is not quite as sizzling so you could still watch it with your parents if they happened to be in the room. (Use your best judgment, they're your parents after all.) I give this film a high mark because it is very user friendly, romantic comedy enthusiasts will find it sublime, and those who are just watching along with them should find plenty of humor to enjoy as well.Again, credit goes to Emile Ardolino for making the most of a charming script by Randy and Perry Howze.

The acting is also brilliant, and after seeing this movie several times, each another time makes me thinking again about my and our life, and also about the type of the gender relationships which concerns lies.The story begins in the late 50's, and the first part concerns the lives of the characters at their early 20's.

The first time you see this movie, most of the interest is how did the lives changed over the 20 years, and what kind of an end the movie has. But it turns out that almost every scene and cite play an important role there, and after seeing it a few times I noticed that the movie is not just about the tales of the three girls and how does lives change.For example, each of the parts is built by a pattern where the first half tells about the lives of the three girls, and the second half tells about Katya's (main character's) relationship with a boyfriend. In each of the parts the relationship isn't built in a pure way, since Katya must hide some facts about her (and even lie) to make sure everything will go on (I think this is the reason for making Gosha a macho man, and seeing it again you may find out what makes him behave like that). But in the two parts there are different kind of lies and relationships, and I think that makes the writer to put different endings at the parts. Although the first part has a sad end (what also reflects Katya's life further), in the second part the relationship doesn't break after Katya's boyfriend finds the truth about her.Besides this example, there are many other topics about life which this film concerns. Seeing it enough times makes you sure that Gosha isn't as awful as he seems to be at the first time you see the movie (his past is barley mentioned, but when you find it out, it clears the scene where he meets Nikolay, and what will be afterwards), and therefore the ending may be concerned good.Again, this film may be watched again and again, in a very entertaining way, and each time telling you more about the plot.

Seeing it enough times makes you sure that Gosha isn't as awful as he seems to be at the first time you see the movie (his past is barley mentioned, but when you find it out, it clears the scene where he meets Nikolay, and what will be afterwards), and therefore the ending may be concerned good.Again, this film may be watched again and again, in a very entertaining way, and each time telling you more about the plot.

But many times I've noticed some details in the plot which made me estimating again what is really happening there, and what were the writer's main idea in such a plot. The acting is also brilliant, and after seeing this movie several times, each another time makes me thinking again about my and our life, and also about the type of the gender relationships which concerns lies.The story begins in the late 50's, and the first part concerns the lives of the characters at their early 20's. Then, the film jumps about 20 years forward, and the second part concerns the lives of the characters at their late 30's (or early 40's). The first time you see this movie, most of the interest is how did the lives changed over the 20 years, and what kind of an end the movie has. But it turns out that almost every scene and cite play an important role there, and after seeing it a few times I noticed that the movie is not just about the tales of the three girls and how does lives change.For example, each of the parts is built by a pattern where the first half tells about the lives of the three girls, and the second half tells about Katya's (main character's) relationship with a boyfriend. In each of the parts the relationship isn't built in a pure way, since Katya must hide some facts about her (and even lie) to make sure everything will go on (I think this is the reason for making Gosha a macho man, and seeing it again you may find out what makes him behave like that).

'Everyone says I love you' is probably one of the few that I have managed to find at least tolerable thanks to a charming and delightfully funny script that occupies the moments between all that -mostly- awkward music and dance.Performances by the cast are terrific with everyone bringing their characters to life wonderfully. The pacing was a little uneven particularly in the middle section where things stalled a little and I began to lose interest but generally the plot moves along well enough.It's simply just the rather mundane overall theme of love and romance that I feel hinders the film as it doesn't ever stray into anything distinguishably memorable. That and the whole musical thing which -as I feel with most- distracts and takes away from the film more than contribute. One scene that I think all agree was amazingly done was the final dance between Allen and Hawn which is just wonderful to watch play out and serves as a nice payoff for the film.Overall, Everyone Says I Love You is a funny and quirky take on romance and musicals that serves as a fun, un-taxing way to spend 90 minutes.

It's all political correct, contrived, formulaic and worst of all, unfunny.In all my IMDb reviews, I have not rated one Ben Stiller film. All of them are pathetic (and guess what, there's something about mary was just as bad as the rest). Some fellow actors say he's so serious when he works and so many people think he's side-splitting. If you ask me, he is the most unfunny actor in the history of comedy and has a clear ability to pick the most pathetic scripts circling Hollywood.Him aside, this film is dreadful. It isn't funny and if you think it is, then I wonder what would happen if i put a flash light to your left ear. Would I see light coming out the right side? Let's look at some of the pathetic attempt at comedy used in this one. The character's surname is Focker. Gee that's funny (not). The screenwriters must have agonized for months before coming up with the idea of giving the main character a surname that they can milk about 1000 unfunny one-liners and jokes from. Then, after you think they milked that one for everything it's worth, a sequel emerges titled Meet the Fockers, where the surname is giving rise to more material. Suffice to say that the sequel was worse than this, but I won't review it since I can't set the IMDb star rating into negative territory.Then they set up stupid and deeply contrived scenarios like Mr. Focker going through the brother's underwear draw. Gee, that one was funny and original..... NOT. After this, the writers obviously had to apply their intelligence as they must have realized that it was seriously lacking. So they ever so slightly raised the bar and tried to come up with the father-in-law from hell, even though that in itself is deeply clichéd. So they made him some sort of ex-CIA something or rather, with a lie detector in his basement so that the future son-in-law's sexual past can be probed.At this point, I actually felt embarrassed for Robert De Niro. Someone certainly must have called in a big favor to get him on-board this rubbish. Another pathetic protuberance along the downwardly-inclined road that is Hollywood comedy.And.... I've said it before so I'll say it again - I'm still waiting for a Ben Stiller film that I actually like.

Everything about the leading character is simply outstanding. The Mexican woman and the marshal's wife are powerful characters too. The timing of the movie is impressive the clock is ticking, the marshal seems to get older with each minute, and the pressure is increasing. The interaction of the main hero and the town's people is very interesting (only two persons show their free will to stand up and fight a teenager and a one-eyed drunkard).Bad side. The main villain. He is so lame and unimpressive that I really felt frustration when he appeared. Is this what we had been waiting for? Jack Colby is a sidekick only, but he is so much more memorable. The way Jack Colby glances, the way he walks, and the way he talks are at least cool. What I am driving at, Frank Miller sucks. The final shootout. Here lies another weak point of the film. We've been waiting for something amazing. Well, I have been waiting. And what do I get? The choreography is almost non-existent. I cannot even see what happens. Bang! And one of the villains is out of the game like a toy soldier. We don't even see how it all happens. Bang! And another is falling at such a long distance from the camera that it looks impersonal and unemotional. Here I remember watching The Wild Bunch &#150; a few minutes of the movie passes and you already have a very stylish bloodbath. I also would like to compare High Noon to The Hitcher &#150; remember that one? The final fight in The Hitcher is as powerful as an A-bomb. And there's nothing to do with colour. Black-and-white is not a problem. I guess High Noon gives me an example of anticlimactic ending. The shootout is very real, I guess, but it is not stylish. For me it is a problem.Verdict as a psychological drama this movie is fine (if Mr Bill Clinton really likes this movie that much, he surely has a good taste in cinema), but as a western it is a weak attempt (if I want a stylish western, I will watch Per un pugno di dollari, C'era una volta il West or The Wild Bunch instead).Still, I give it a 7 out of 10.

As the story progressed however I began to feel for the main characters more and specifically loved Jude Law's character of whom he had done a great job of bringing to life. The character that I felt wasn't fleshed out as much as they should have been was Uma Thurman's, which also hindered quite a bit of the plot involving her relationship and feelings for Vincent (Ethan Hawke). The story between the brothers may also have been a tad clichéd but in the context of the story, it was a lot more interesting, original and compelling to watch than I've seen so many times before.And so it was somewhere during the middle of the story where I felt the story began to get a little too comfortable in the telling of the romance between Irene and Vincent because of insufficient characterisation up until that point I just didn't buy it. I was far more interested in the genetic technology present in this future and the discrimination that it entailed for the 'In-Valid' citizens. It is a theme that can be extrapolated from any society in the history of mankind and so makes it both relevant to us today and also of our history. Of course the film makes a direct reference to this when mentioning that it is science, not skin colour these days that determines your class. Sadly however, we're not treated to more than is accessible during the film which is a real shame because it certainly was an interesting theme to deal with and Niccol seemed very competent at delivering it.In the end, Gattaca turned out to be a very nice science-fiction drama with a fantastic cast and some very original and interesting ideas from Andrew Niccol that I won't forget anytime soon. I recommend it to everyone!
