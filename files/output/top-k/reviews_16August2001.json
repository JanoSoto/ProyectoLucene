People are stupid sometimes but not all of the time and anyone could see that this film was priding itself on the fact that it was the first film to be filmed completely on a computer.  Great, but what they forgot was that the story was nothing that we haven't seen before.  Here is the premise, a bunch of renegade soldiers are sent to a planet to stop a bunch of aliens or creatures from ruining what is left of Earth.  You have a Linda Hamilton clone from T-2.  You have every one of the important characters from Aliens basically cloned right down to Alec Baldwin playing Hicks, Buscemi playing Hudson and Terri Gilpin playing Vasquez.  There was not one original idea in here so all they had to go on was the fact that they were computer animated and that they were one of the biggest video games around.  So back to Mason.  He was so confident that this was going to do well, he bet me that this film would make about 120 million dollars at the N.A. box office.  I thought it would do something similar to last years box disaster, A.E.  I guessed less than 35 million.  Guess who was right?There are many reasons why Final Fantasy failed.  One of them is that the film just plain sucked.  I finally took my 8 year old step son to see the film and he is big fan of the video game.  I myself am a pretty big fan of video games but have never really heard of Final Fantasy.  So I sucked it up and antied up the $20.00 and went. To sum it up, we were both confused by what was happening, unamused at the humour and generally had no interest in the story or what was going on in this fictional world.

But this time, it was me asking him questions as well, hoping that his knowledge of the video game could help me comprehend what we just spent my twenty bucks on.  But to no avail.Final Fantasy was destined to fail when they made it look like Aliens, T2 and the Abyss.  James Cameron should actually sue them for whatever money they are going to make off this film because there is not a single line in this film that doesn't seem to come from James' vernacular.

I was yelling and screaming, Greg!Why?????NOOO!! Yes I am a big fan of the man and I found it very surprising that he took the part as Brandon. After being lovers for 8 years Brandon and Nick are the complete opposite of each other yet they have so much to teach and learn from each other. When Nick gets tested positive Brandon gets scared and after trying his hardest to cope with Nick's illness he backs away from him in fear...maybe even a slight hatred that he is going to die. So they break up, Brandon finds someone else, who is very young and Nick just pretends he doesn't care. 1 year later Nick finds out he has only a few days to live after he discovers he has a brain tumour. He holds a party gathering friends and family. When Brandon turns up out of the blue everyone hates the idea of him being there, even Nick, but Brandon too needs to say goodbye.

It's the same thing all right, but there is just enough difference to slightly throw you off. After a while you forget about the minor technical variations and enjoy the wonderful music. \tOnce I adjusted to the silence of Charlie Chaplin's 1925 silent film, I was able to watch it like any other movie.  I could laugh, sympathize, hope, and loathe for the characters, all of the things a movie can make you do. All it took was appreciation of the effort it took people like Chaplin who essentially made something from nothing. In this case, that something is a funny, innovative, and entertaining movie. \tThe Gold Rush revolves around Chaplin's character, the Lone Prospector, in the Yukon where many men seek a fortune in gold. He seeks shelter in a cabin inhabited by wanted criminal Black Larson (Tom Murray) who tries to get rid of Chaplin in one of the funniest scenes of the movie, in which a strong wind prevents Chaplin from leaving. Big Jim McKay (Mack Swain), who has found gold, also enters the cabin.  Larson goes out to look food, leaving Big Jim and Chaplin together.  At one point, Big Jim gets so hungry he sees an illusion of Chaplin as a giant chicken. When I saw this scene, I realized that it was probably the first time that this invention, which I have seen in many modern movies and television shows to the point that it is overused, was applied in film. \tFurther along in the film, the Chaplin character visits a small boom town where he meets and falls in love with Georgia (Georgia Hale), who only uses him to make ladies' man Jack Cameron (Malcolm Waite) jealous and regards the little shabbily dressed man as a joke. At this point, I didn't care that the characters didn't really speak or that the film was in black and white. I was too involved in the story to be bothered by the rudimental aspects of the film.

I found myself hoping for him to be happy, wanting to see the underdog eventually come out on top. \tWhile it is impossible to ignore the movie as a silent film, it is equally impossible to ignore it as a great comedy that could capably rival any modern comedy, and, like Chaplin's character, come out on top.

That's exactly my feeling after watching Flawless. This was a film combining DeNiro, one of the great actors of all time, with one of Hollywood's best young actors, Phillip Seymour Hoffman. While I didn't expect fireworks, that combination alone should have brought at least a compelling tale. However, director Joel Schumaker as usual mucks things up. Schumacker seems to have good ideas for his films but only one Falling Down would I give a good grade too. Schumacker comes from the Micahel Bay school of filmmaking always make sure you put some fast event in every 2 minutes because otherwise the viewer won't like it. A stroy like this needed time to develop and obviously Schumacker wasn't going to allow it. Briefly the plot DeNiro is a security guard who was known as a hero many years ago for saving people from a hostage situation. He lives in an old apartment with many drag queens next to him(one is Phillip Seymour Hoffman) and DeNiro to say the least doesn't get along with them. He gets his satisfaction from whores but is lonely most of the time. Meanwhile, a messy subplot involving money and bad guys causes hell to break loose in the apartment. DeNiro hears a scream for help starts to act then gets a stroke which causes him to be paralyzed on one side. DeNiro then learns singing lessons will help get his voice back so he goes to Hoofman, a songing drag queen who eventually helps him. The scenes between DeNiro and Hoffman sometimes worked, especially the dramatic ones. Many of the dialogue is funny(this film is categorized as a comedy) but still feels awkward. However, the whole money subplot is not only boring, it takes a way from the good moments between the two stars. The performances were so-so. Hoffman is talented as the drag queeen altho the routine gets a little old. I admired DeNiro doing something different but I still get the impression he kind of sleepwalked through the role. The film could really use a third supporting charecter but no can do, everyone else is virtually forgettable. As is the movie. Overall, Flawless wasn't a complete bomb, but there were too many bad things to overshadow some of the good moments.

They always have the needless alterations, such as one character saying a line which in the book was said by a different character and\/or way out of sequence.  The movie AIRPORT does this, but since both the book and the movie are set in a time span of about 7-8 hours, the time distortion or condensation is not a deficiency in the movie.But I am aware now that the movie greatly extends the role of Airport Manager Mel Bakersfeld Burt Lancaster way out of shape.  He makes several auto trips from the main airport terminal to the primary runway where the 707 is stuck beneath the snow, and, as the book points out correctly, each such trip would take a long time with many orders from ground control.  And then Bakersfeld was the one who interrogated the distraught bomber's wife, where in the book, as would be in reality, that was done by the airport police supervisor, who in the movie was relegated to a lead security guard. These things were presumably done to create a more 'starring' role for Lancaster; who does a good job, but his character, already proficient, just goes well beyond an airport manager's scope.Captain Vernon Demarest Dean Martin is played well, but he is toned down a little from the unfriendly arrogance found in the book.  Jean Seaberg plays a good Tanya, but her going with Bakersfeld on his many trips to the runway is another 'starring role' insertion device.  Helen Hayes was wonderful as the old lady stowaway; probably the one character who was actually improved from the novel.As for the long time in character developoment, delaying the *action* the audience is supposed to know has to be coming, I consider that a positive.

Most people refuse to like this film, because it's not Aliens (1986) - and nor should it be... The thing I like most about this franchise is that every film is different, mainly down to the use of a different Director with a different style for each film. Alien 3 marked the film debut of commercials wiz-kid David Fincher -another reason people don't like this film (but I discussed that more in-depth in my review of Se7en).Alien 3 is the most beautiful, thoughtful and yes, darker Alien film... Alex Thomson's gold tinted photography creates a gothic and haunting look and atmosphere to the prison colony, (what with this film and Se7en I would say Fincher has seen Lars Von Trier's The Element of Crime (1983) one too many times). This also takes the franchise back into a more adult area, the character are more human, not the caricatured hero's we saw in Aliens, these are tortured people with dark pasts, we only get small hints as to why they are there, but that's enough. Fincher has an obsession with the darker side of man, it's apparent in all of his films right up to the more recent Fight Club (1999) - but with Alien 3, he takes one of cinema's most well thought of, and well loved characters (Weaver's Ellen Ripley) and strips away the tough cookie exterior that surrounded her in Cameron's predecessor. Here we see the torture she has endured in the previous instalments, what she's lost - she no-longer feels human, she has more connection with the alien...

Nearly a thousand different frames fly by your eyes in the beginning of the movie moving from one picture to the next. If you are not alert while watching this movie, you will be visually dazed. The story line is nothing out of the ordinary.  Two lovers battle over the same girl and you can pretty much predict the ending except with a little twist.Many people walked out of the theater crying but the movie didn't seem to hit me that much.  The visual effects are interesting but the movie seems to bounce around way to much.  I found myself rubbing my eyes trying to focus on what was going on but it was hard.  The first half of Moulin Rouge is the best part of the movie in my opinion.  It is gracefully funny and entertaining.  The second half moves along extremely slow for over an hour going back and forth about how much each person loves the girl.  It made me sick and wanting to run out of the theater.  I thought the ending was never going to come.The acting was superb!  Nicole Kidman as Satine does a fantastic acting job throughout the film.  I wouldn't be shocked to see her nominated and winning a best actress award when the oscars come around.  Ewan McGregor also does a great job acting.  Though a singing voice is patched in over his because after this movie is a musical.Overall, I was entertained for the first half of the movie but then the love story took over and I started to slide down my chair.  The movie moves really fast and at times is quite tedious.  If you like love stories and like movies where you cry (girls), you will like this movie.

Jurassic Park from 1993 was not a very good movie. It was very predictable and you could see in advance who was going to die and who was going to stay alive.In short it was a little boring,(and the book was even worse). And yet it wasn't a total disaster. There is at least one scene that became a classic which everyone copies ever since and it has some idea's which if they were more developed the film would be better. The Lost World Jurassic Park was a much more entertaining film, largely thanks to the decision to take the T-Rex to the big city. It was done in such a fun and I saw it as a parody to than upcoming Godzilla(and when Godzilla was finally out,it proved to be the worse of the 2 films).So now we reach our current film and there is no good words about it. It is simply a bad movie. I have a theory about JP3. Spielberg didn't want to make it. He didn't think he have anything new to say and he was busy with 2 other,more important, projects(A.I. and Minority Report). Universal studios wanted a third sequel so eventually Spielberg agreed making the film but retain the title of executive producer(which meant that he get some percentage of the profits, but has nothing to say on the film).To show you how bad the film is, here some guiding points for watching it1. If a child disappears in the first act of the film he will show up later on the film, managing, miraculously, to survive a place where adults are having hard time to survive.2.If the parents of the child are divorced, by the end of the film, they will get back together. The father will prove himself to be worthy of the woman love and admiration. (This is suppose to be and action movie and we get a film which reinforce the value of the American family.Yack!!!).3. If one of the good guys do something bad, that he shouldn't have done he will redeem himself and will get the chance to be only badly wounded instead of getting killed.Beside the written above, the film is a re-hearse of idea's from the first 2 movies. The idea that the dinosaurs are intelligent creatures was use in the first film. The idea that they are very paternal was use in the second one. The second idea is put against the human angel. The dinosaurs are portrait as more caring for their offspring(even the unborn), than the human ones.Joe Johnston, the director, can't handle an action film. He has made all the wrong decisions in directing the film(and it should be mentioned here that Jumanji,one of his previous work,suffered from the same problems)and it looked like he tried to copy someone else instead of trying to be original. The ending of the film, beside been a re-shot of the first film, show a lack of judgment from all people involved. If the flying dinosaurs(and I can't pronounce their name) are so dangerous why even let them leave the island? Only the screenwriters and the producers know.The only 2 good things in the movie, which helped the movie get a 3 out of 10 from me instead the 1 out of 10 it deserved, were the special effects, which should not be surprise and Sam Neill whose dry tone was on the verge of been cynic. A tone which said Yes, I've been there and yes it's a repeat, but I get so much money so why the hell not to do it.In short. This is film to be avoided. It is waste time and a waste of money. Both should be spent somewhere else.
