Well, as someone who has been watching Hong Kong action cinema and Samurai films for years, I must honestly report that this film, while enjoyable and excellent in many respects, does not quite live up to the hype.But let's discuss the good, first. Casting is excellent. I've loved Michelle Yeoh and Chow Yun Fat for years, and it was a genuine pleasure to see them together in this film. Both of them excel in both acting and martial arts abilities here. Also excellent is the beautiful young actress Ziyi Zhang as Jen Yu, and Chen Chang, as the bandit Lo, brings a much-appreciated dose of humor and charm to contrast the more severe and reserved characters played by Chow Yun and Michelle. Their intermingled stories of unrequited love are funny and heartbreaking and provide some enjoyable down time between combat sequences.The Action scenes are also, for the most part, lighting-paced and exciting. I especially enjoyed the sword styles used in the film. The sword battle between Michelle Yeoh and Ziyi Zhang is amazing, and Chow Yun Fat seems to effortlessly make Green Destiny dance like a living thing.However, the one thing that completely detracted from the film's magic was the overblown use of wire work. Characters seem to fly more than they walk in this film, and the whole thing takes on a ridiculous Peter Pan quality after a while. I know everyone thinks that wire work is new, a trend started by The Matrix. The fact is that it's been used (and overused) in many Martial Arts films for years. I've never been a huge fan of it. However, I enjoyed the wire work in The Matrix because it was used relatively sparingly and punctuated the action perfectly. It was also much more believable once we understood that the world of The Matrix was a computer-created illusion, unfettered by real physics. However, I fear that the popularity of The Matrix has created a disturbing new trend of using wire work as a crutch to boost the action sequences, as seen in Romeo Must Die, the horrific Charlie's Angels, and now here. But the thing that bothered me the most about the wire work in this film is that it LOOKED like wire work. It was much more clean-looking and effective when used in short bursts in the The Matrix. Here, however, characters float from roof to roof as if Peking were one big trampoline, and it is blatantly obvious in their movements that they are suspended from something (although the wires themselves have all been digitally erased, of course). While it didn't completely ruin the film for me, it did keep me from taking it very seriously a lot of the time, and that is too bad because this epic story was meant to be taken seriously. In my (not so) humble opnion, however, the best martial arts films are those that can display amazing physical feats while still observing the basic laws of physics. Perhaps that is why some of the old Japanese Samurai films (for example, the Lone Wolf and Cub series) are so incredible, because the strength of the action sequences flowed from the actor's skill and lightning-speed with his blade, rather than his character's supposed ability to jump into the air and run across his enemies' heads like stepping stones. So, bottom line, this is a film worth seeing, and there is much here to enjoy. Just don't feel guilty about laughing at the excessive wire work, and don't go into the theater expecting it to be the Second Coming of Bruce Lee.

But, for anyone who is interested in knowing what really happened, Thirteen Days is as good as it gets. I am no die-hard Costner fan, but I must defend him here. I have read and heard a lot about how he lets his personal admiration of the Kennedy's show in his acting. THIS IS NOT TRUE. The character he plays, Kenny O'Donnell, first met JFK in the mid-1950's. At first, O'Donnell wasn't impressed. By the time JFK was elected, O'Donnell was closer than any non-family member could get to both JFK and RFK. He would have done anything for either one of them. His nickname was 'The Cobra', and everyone knew that to get to either brother, they'd first have to go through O'Donnell. He was also one of the 'Irish Mafia', so I don't think it's fair to knock Costner for letting his penchant for accents show. O'Donnell did have a strong New England\/Irish accent, and often tried to hide it. The movie is also very objective. It does not take any dramatic license with any of the events or characters. The closest I could find to a serious omission is Bobby Kennedy wasn't shown to be as integral a player as he really was for JFK - yet it still does better than any previous work in establishing his importance. Any of the dialogue or actions shown in the movie actually did happen, and if anything the producers left out some factual things that could've made people skeptical. More than anything, I would like to emphasize that Thirteen Days tells the story as it really happened, and the all the various people as they really were.

","genre":"Drama, History, Thriller"},{"date":"13 January 2001","score":"","review":"  I am currently working on a set of volumes about Jack and Bobby Kennedy, and have spent hundreds of hours researching everything about the Kennedy administration. As movies go, Thirteen Days has been the most historically accurate film I have ever seen. I cannot speak much for the suspense, because everything that happened, or was said, I already knew about. But, for anyone who is interested in knowing what really happened, Thirteen Days is as good as it gets. I am no die-hard Costner fan, but I must defend him here. I have read and heard a lot about how he lets his personal admiration of the Kennedy's show in his acting. THIS IS NOT TRUE. The character he plays, Kenny O'Donnell, first met JFK in the mid-1950's. At first, O'Donnell wasn't impressed. By the time JFK was elected, O'Donnell was closer than any non-family member could get to both JFK and RFK. He would have done anything for either one of them. His nickname was 'The Cobra', and everyone knew that to get to either brother, they'd first have to go through O'Donnell. He was also one of the 'Irish Mafia', so I don't think it's fair to knock Costner for letting his penchant for accents show.

I picked out on a slow weekend, figuring I'd only be out a buck-fifty. First a quick comment about the original  I've only seen it twice, thought it was a good movie, and that's about it.  All the concepts about directorial genius and trend-setting are lost on me. Alfred Hitchcock is an excellent director, and I haven't seen a bad movie by him yet...though I've only seen three of his movies. So what sort of judge does that make me?Now on with this one Like the original, I thought it was a good movie...no more, no less...nothing I would add to my video collection, but nothing I would turn off, either.  Plot\/script It's identical to the original, so what's to say about one that hasn't been said about another.  I will say this Hitchcock did it first, and that is a vitally important factor to consider, especially since it was done 40 years ago.The remaking  Duplicating Hitchcock's scenes with a marvelous respect for the original.  It conveyed the paranoia, the fear and tension that ran through Hitchcock's.  Once again, Hitchcock did do it first, but then again, Van Sant is not trying to be original here.  He is recreating. The parts added in The mastrubation scene, that weird little flashing scene of cow and woman as William Macy meets Normans mother neither added or took away, though the latter was kind of unusual. What was it supposed to mean?actors and their parts Overall, an improvement from the original. Vince Vaughn was a far superior as Norman Bates, completely unsettling and unnerving. At first appearing normal, then disintegrating into his madness as the light of attention remained shining on him. Anne Heche reprised Janet Leigh with the same distracted am-I-working-for-actor-guild-dues that seemed to be present in the original. Juliane Moore did well. Viggo Mortensen was less likable in his part.  He came across as amoral bully.  I wasn't expecting William Macy to show up as the detective, but when he did I crowed with laughter.  He played it straight and did well. Scenes and sets Some minor modifications, but hardly anything to comment on.  They did not detract from the movie, so they did their job.  The Bates home was remarkable in its ordinary nature, which, to me, made it even more spooky than the original.Now for the negative  What decade is it?  Yeah, we've got modern cars and walkmen.  But we have clothing that is decidedly dated, Macy being the most obvious.  The sexism seemed more yesteryear. And it had the feel, at least to me, of a 80s horror movie.  The combination was distracting, and the only really bad thing I can think to say of the movie.However, the viewing public, as a majority, does not seem to be a fan of scene-for-scene remakes, so I doubt we will see too many more. Which is too bad, as I would love to see fresh faces and modern technology interpret many older movies.

It's a part of the literary genre, and even the whole discipline of kung fu is to achieve an enlightened state so one can levitate and defy gravity. So i think the story is totally logical. But even if you didn't know that, which i didn't before my friends informed me, i don't understand why one cannot accept the movie. It's clearly a fantasy, a myth, very much like matrix. And movies, what movies are supposed to do is provide an escape not only from our world, but also from the very physical rules that govern it. Seeing people leaping towards buildings shouldn't be any more startling than seeing James bond dive from a plane, a technician disarming a bomb, or a middle aged man trying to seduce his daughter's cheerleader girlfriend. It's the movies!And also, with regards to your lack of passion between the leads, I'm surprised you would make such a statement if you had liked the Ice storm Clearly the leads cared for each other in their facial expressions, the tone of voice with which they communicated, but they DID NOT show unrestrained passion like the younger lovers did. Obviously, this was set up in a sense and sensibility kind of way. Some will even argue that they had passion but it's suppressed because of their oath to her late fiance. I believe that there is not so much passion between them, but that doesn't mean there love is any less valuable, deserving or beautiful. They are more like soulmates on an emotional level, and their love was something great to behold-Just like the movie itself.

The most enjoyable part of the movie was watching their relationship blossom. They had great chemistry together.  The movie is essentially about a Hollywood movie crew that invades a Vermont town to film a movie called the Old Mill. Problems arise when they discover the Old Mill has burned down so the script has to change which creates the problem for Hoffman's character. Enter Rebecca Pidgeon to light the fire of imagination for Hoffman to help him regain his confidence. Meanwhile the lead actor, Bob Barrenger, has a thing for underaged girl Carla Taylor played by Julia Stiles, so he becomes involved with her while her father Jack Taylor. thinks she is out studying, Jack Taylor is played by Ricky Jay. The Baldwin character ends up in a traffic accident witht the young girl which destroys the Main Street traffic light. Comedy relief is provided in the form of William H. Macy as Walt, the self obsessed director and David Paymer as the cutthroat producer. Patti Lupone and Charles Durning make brief appearances as the mayor and his wife who want to bring Hollywood into their home. The movie has some funny moments, but it seems weak into comparinson with a great comedy like Best in Show. The location was beautiful, and so was Rebecca Pidgeon, but I rate this movie only a six out of 10. I think Mamet is better suited to drama.
