[{"date":"13 March 2015","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Blast from the Past is a relatively entertaining 1999 comedy that could be considered the final installment of the Brendan Fraser Fish out of Water Trilogy, following Encino Man and George of the Jungle.The film stars Christopher Walken and Sissy Spacek as a 1950's couple with a child named Adam, who hide out in a bomb shelter during the 50's and what happens when a grown-up Adam (Fraser) decides to venture out of the shelter in 1999 Los Angeles because the family needs supplies.Fraser's effortless screen charisma and his experience with this kind of character makes this movie seem a lot better than it really is. Walken and Spacek are wonderful as his parents and Alicia Silverstone is adequate as the obligatory romantic interest.Hugh Wilson's direction is exuberant and keeps the story somewhat believable but it's really the performances of Fraser, Walken, and Spacek as the family caught in a time warp that make this film worth sitting through.
