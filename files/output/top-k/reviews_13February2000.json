From the giant oozing demon in the beginning to the gray blind boar and the Spirit of the Forest (which looks like an antelope with a smiling human face), Miyazaki was able to tap into something very deep and provoking. The creatures are at the same time beautiful and terribly ugly. Like the race of the little white ghosts that inhabit the forest. They are some of the most achingly cute characters ever made (in fact, I saw dolls of these characters at a gift shop in Little Tokyo), but at the same time a little disturbing once you realize that their heads are like skulls and their bodies like Pillsbury Dough Boys. I found myself flinching in terror at the sight of the blind boar with blood gushing out of his eyes. On that note, I think that the violence of this movie really propels it to another level. It was the one thing that really got reactions from the audience. And I'm not talking the kind of gratuitous violence in action movies. The violence in Princess Mononoke is quite extreme, but it does so to portray the brutality of human (and animal) conflict.Unfortunately, I was disappointed by the voice acting in the American adaptation. It was really a mixed bag. Billy Bob Thornton, Minnie Driver, and Gillian Anderson in particular were fabulous, but I felt that Billy Crudup and Claires Danes did some typical cartoon overacting. Many may disagree on me with this, but I found it to be distracting and cheesy at times.I would also like to comment on the current popularity of anime. With the slew of violent action movies being brought over to the states (Ninja Scroll, Gundam, etc.), people get the misconception that the appeal of anime is the mature content. But the real beauty and success of Japanese animation is in the way the artists are able to convey the smallest details of real human life. Hayao Miyazaki's work (My Neighbor Totoro, Castle in the Sky, Kiki's Delivery Service) is a prime example of this. Such as in Princess Mononoke in a scene where a leper, completely covered in bandages, talks about the tragedy of his life.  You cannot see his face or tell by his voice that he is crying, but rather from the bandages over his eyes, where dark circles appear as his tears soak the fabric.  It's scenes like this that make the film so impressive.

It is the true story of Frank McCourt and his family as they face the troubles of being poor. The movie is enjoyable but don't expect it to cheer you up or put you in a good mood. It does just the opposite of that depressing you and making you grateful for the many pleasures that we have. It shows how bad life can be but how you have to keep hope through hardships of titanic size. This movie will be liked and enjoyed by many regardless if you have read the book or not.The acting in Angela's Ashes is strong especially by the two lead actors. Emily Watson plays Angela McCourt the somber and dreary wife and mother of the family. Watson gives a good performance that we have seen from her before in movies like Breaking the Waves, Hilary and Jackie, and The Boxer. The three young men who play Frank McCourt are impressive but the best performance in this movie definitely comes from Robert Carlyle. He plays the McCourt father, Malachy McCourt. He has been seen in weaker roles before in movies like The Full Monty and most recently the latest Bond flick, The World is not Enough. He is a pleasure to watch as the alcoholic father tormented by his own pride who drinks the rare money away. He certainly gives the best performance in Angela's Ashes and it is too bad that we did not get to see a little more of him. Carlyle and Watson have great chemistry together and are very good as husband and wife. The movie is also directed well by Alan Parker who gives the movie a kind of beautiful feel. He gives the movie a certain tint that makes even the most horrendous of places gleam with life. It gives the movie a good feel and makes it more pleasant to watch. The only problem I had with Angela's Ashes is that the McCourt family seems too stereotypical. It seems as if we have seen this family before. We have seen the father before who is plagued with afflictions that drinks the money away even when his newborn baby at home is hungry and cold. He has too much pride and eventually is driven away by his own shame. We have also seen Emily Watson's mother and wife character before. The sympathetic mother who will do anything to make her children's lives better and the reluctant wife who regrets the marriage that she is trapped in. They are your usual poor family living in your usual squalid conditions. This is the only disappointing part of Angela's Ashes. All in all Angela's Ashes does justice to the book. It does what few movies based on books do today. While I am positive that it is not nearly as good as the book I do think that it comes close to it. Those who have read the book will not be disappointed as well as those of us who have not read the memoir. The movie in its finality is a satisfying movie experience showing you a different aspect of life where there is never any hope for any of the characters. You just hope that they survive another day living in their unsanitary conditions. The movie is worth seeing if you liked or are interested in the book but may prove to be dull or unmoving if you have never experienced the novel. As the movie meanders through the troubles of being poor it is too bad that the characters and the story was not a little more original. It is too bad that Angela's Ashes did not have its own certain traits to make it different from the other films about being poor.*** (money well spent)  ","genre":null},{"date":"13 February 2000","score":"","review":"  Angela's Ashes is a dark, gloomy tale set in the poverty-stricken areas of Limerick, Ireland.

You aren't crying because Bambi mother's was killed or because Jack Dawson went down with the ship; instead you are identifying with the power of the human spirit. Rudy is an ordinary man, you could even argue that he is less than ordinary in regards to his physical tributes and academic capacity, but he achieves an extraordinary feat. He leads with his heart, even when he doesn't fully understand why he is putting himself through such perils. He seeks to prove himself to others, to all those who doubted him and he thrives to achieve his goal for those few who believed in him. And eventually, when he tested in his darkest moment, his epipany comes he needs to do this for himself.Sean Astin is brilliant in his role as Notre Dame's most famous would-be underachiever. He plays Rudy with such dedication and determination that it is impossible not to be impressed by his perseverance, inspired by his courage, and touched by his passion for the game. The story is wonderfully told by director David Anspaugh and writer Angelo Pizzo. Jerry Goldsmith's score and Oliver Wood's cinematography truly capture the power and beauty of the story. This film is an incredible achievement. It touches its viewers right where it counts in the heart. And the film has its own emotional centre, its own eloquent theme which everyone can identify with.

After viewing it, one can definitely say that it is highly unlikely that they have ever seen a film quite like it before. Do I recommend it, well it definitely depends upon your frame of mind at the time you plan on seeing it. There are a few frames of mind in which I think you should see this film...1) if you are in a good mood and not willing to take life too seriously; 2) you're feeling cynical about the American family and are questioning our values and need supporting evidence; or 3) you think your own family is messed up and need a point of comparison. If you are in any of the above three frames. I think you will enjoy this film tremendously. However, if you are going to a movie to escape life's problems and be entertained...I suggest you stay away. Kevin Spacey plays a father going through a psuedo mid-life crisis, quits his job and searches for happiness in his marriage and in daily living. Annette Bening is Spacey's wife, who has passed through her mid-life crisis and has embarked upon life's next stage....only to be brought back to reality by her husband's behavior. Add to this setting, an introverted daughter, gay neighbors, and a militaristic conservative minded neighbor and his rebellious son and you have a typical American neighborhood....and maybe not. Dreamworks produces a film that crosses many boundaries and embraces quite a few taboos without questioning the impact or challenging the results of such behavior. The film simply presents a version of an American family and their neighbors and then lets the audience decide whether or not to accept it. Can the audience relate the characters? You sure can. Can you identify with each and every character?..probably not....but again you don't really know your neighbors or the people down the street do you? Bottom line....you may feel that American Beauty is a very good film, but you will definitely agree that it is not a feel good film.

The first 2 are some of my favorite films so i was worried that this one would end up being disappointing. Boy was i wrong. Though this isn't the scariest of the trilogy, it's the most thought provoking. It ties up all the loose ends that were brought up in the first 2 and the final chapter really does have an interesting story to tell. This film gives the chracters and the audience watching the film the closure they need.first of all when the movie started i was a tad bit dsappointed. the opening scene wasn't very thrilling and it was a little short so i though oh boy this isn't starting off right. it was a descent opening scene. i jumped a few times but it didn't have the shock value the first 2 had. despite that flaw when scream 3 finally gets started we get involved in a mystery that somehow takes us back to where it all began. this mystery involves sidney's mother who had a secret life of her own. speaking of sidney, in this installment she is in hiding, this is because Psychos can't kill what they can't find. While sidney is in hiding she begins to have visions of her dead mother. proving that the evnets in her life have finally taken a toll on her. meanwhile in hollywood they are making Stab 3 and when the cast begins to die in the order they die in the script it's up to dewey who si working as an aid on the set and Gale, who is summoned by the FBI to help in the case to solve this mystery. pretty soon sidney makes it to hollywood and the real fun begins.I've always thought that the scream films always managed to produce and create interesting characters. this one is no exception. Neve Campbell is in top form as sidney. In fact in this one she becomes a fighter and has no intention on giving up. neve plays her well and shows us that sidney has grown between films. David arquette is also good as dewey. he isn't as goofy this time around but he's still very funny. i like courtney coc but this gale weathers was different from the firsr 2. i think that she shouyld've played it bitchy again, when she's nice she loses her edge. she was still good but she could've been betterThe characters are a mixed bag(since most of them are just there to get killed) Parker Posey supplies the film with most of its comice relief. she was really good in the role and i thought she was a good new character. jenny macartney was adequate as sarah darling, an actress who is 35 and tired of playing 21 year olds. Scott foley was also good as a directer who's film is being sabotage by a violent killer.The ending was much better than the ending in scream 2. i thought that this endingsolves all the problems that sisdney had been wondering about. at times it seemd cheesy but i do think that it was good and much better than scream 2's ending.I'm glad they decided to end it now because i would hate to see them ruin a good thing. they ended it like they should've. i'll now remember this a trilogy that made me laugh and most of all made me Scream.

Neve Campbell is in top form as sidney. In fact in this one she becomes a fighter and has no intention on giving up. neve plays her well and shows us that sidney has grown between films. David arquette is also good as dewey. he isn't as goofy this time around but he's still very funny. i like courtney coc but this gale weathers was different from the firsr 2. i think that she shouyld've played it bitchy again, when she's nice she loses her edge. she was still good but she could've been betterThe characters are a mixed bag(since most of them are just there to get killed) Parker Posey supplies the film with most of its comice relief. she was really good in the role and i thought she was a good new character. jenny macartney was adequate as sarah darling, an actress who is 35 and tired of playing 21 year olds.

Unfortunately, the one left behind ends up being arrested for drug possession because one of the guys threw away his left-over drugs in his garbage can. The amount of drugs was significant enough to make the police believe he was dealing, which is a capital offense in Malaysia. After numerous appeals, the guy left behind faces the death penalty, but can have that reduced if the other two return and take responsibility for their roles. This means the other two will serve at leat 3-6 years in a Malaysian prison.

Let's cut right to what this movie is about...three guys meet while touring Malaysia and begin hanging out with one another, taking in all the sites of the country and partying throughout. This is one of those great films that will take the audience on an emotional and thinking rollercoaster, but then leave them hanging in mid-air (kind of like that one that broke down at Great America last year). These three guys bond while having fun, but two have to get back to their lives in the United States while the third is going off to help out in the country-side and save endangered animals. Due to some childish behavior on their parts, the local police confront one of the guys (after two have already left the country) about his role in one of their childish antics. Unfortunately, the one left behind ends up being arrested for drug possession because one of the guys threw away his left-over drugs in his garbage can. The amount of drugs was significant enough to make the police believe he was dealing, which is a capital offense in Malaysia. After numerous appeals, the guy left behind faces the death penalty, but can have that reduced if the other two return and take responsibility for their roles. This means the other two will serve at leat 3-6 years in a Malaysian prison. Without saying any more, imagine yourself trying to decide...do you leave your life now, go back and end up in prison to possibly save the life of someone you met for a brief time or stay where you are and let another human being die as a result of your behavior. The emotions run high in this film and the audience member actually feels confronted by such a scenario by asking themselves, what would I do. Bottom line...it may not last long in the theaters, but see it on video then...it is a truly great film.

It did, he did, but Matthew Perry was hilarious - well worth seeing just for his performance.  Amanda Peet was also a nice surprise. She was almost stealing scenes from Mr. Perry.  I had a little trouble getting by a few of the accents that some characters obviously took out of the closet for this film.  When you know the actors well enough, its distracting to wonder whether its working or not.  I think its because I expect them to forget to use it at any given point.  Aside from that, the characters were good throughout, right down to the two detectives investigating the crime. There were a few uneven spots with the dialog, but it was much tighter and more consistent than a recent gangster and his newfound buddy flick, Analyze This.  There are some movies that we like to see over again to pick up the subtleties, and everything else that we missed when we were laughing.  This is one of them.

Denzel Washington's best film to date and that definitely was not an easy task for him to accomplish. If you recently enjoyed seeing Denzel in the Bone Collector then you'll love him as the Hurricane. The Hurricane is based on a true story of Rubin The Hurricane Carter, a contender for the World's Middleweight Championship in the 1960s. That is until he is arrested and convicted for the murder of three people. From the beginning the audience is led to believe that Carter is wrongly accused and convicted solely on the actions of a corrupt police official and on the rising racial tensions of that time period. Many times movies have taken liberties with a story and presented it in such a fashion to make the audience believe what they are seeing is completely and 100% true and accurate. We went through it with the movie JFK and Nixon to name just two stories based upon truth. However, The Hurricane is different. You watch this film and you can't believe the injustice that you are seeing nor can you imagine that such an injustice could continue for almost 20 years. But it can and it did. Check out any web site on Hurricane Carter and you are amazed with what you will find. This film details the story of a young man living in Canada who picks up a book at a used book sale. The book is written by Rubin Carter and chronicles his life from youth through incarceration. The young man writes Rubin Carter in prison to tell him of the impact that his book has had on his life and in return the youth begins to have an impact upon Carter. From here you are thrown into a web of deceit and corruption as the youth and his legal guardians attempt to free Rubin Carter from prison. Throughout the film, you can't help but imagine that you are watching an A&E biography of the man rather than a movie. The film keeps your interest throughout, but it is not until the final courtroom scene when Rod Steiger playing a Federal Judge hears Rubin's case and has to make a decision. It has been a long time since I have been at a film where the audience breaks out in applause and cheers towards the close of a movie, but The Hurricane does it to you. It draws you in from the beginning and doesn't let go until you, as an audience member, personally grasp the injustice. Bottom line...Denzel Washington will surely be a contender, as Rubin was. Let's just hope Denzel wins. ","genre":null},{"date":"13 February 2000","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":"  First of all....I loved it.
