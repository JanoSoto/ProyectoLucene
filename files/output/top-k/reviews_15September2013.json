I found Matrix 1 to be boring and drone on. But now i am 16 and with much more useful knowledge i am going to review it properly.So if you haven't worked out the plot by now here it is in all its glory. Thomas A. Anderson is a man living two lives. By day he is an average computer programmer and by night a malevolent hacker known as Neo. Neo has always questioned his reality but the truth is far beyond his imagination. Neo finds himself targeted by the police when he is contacted by Morpheus, a legendary computer hacker branded a terrorist by the government. Morpheus awakens Neo to the real world, a ravaged wasteland where most of humanity have been captured by a race of machines which live off of their body heat and imprison their minds within an artificial reality known as the Matrix. As a rebel against the machines, Neo must return to the Matrix and confront the agents, super powerful computer programs devoted to snuffing out Neo and the entire human rebellion.So as story and plot goes it is really cyberpunky and futuristic like. When i was watching it i felt like The Matrix was a Cyberpunk film with everyone wearing shades and leather jackets. It felt really futuristic. Nevertheless the plot was really good and kept me really on the edge of my seat. The Characters each had a different personality and fit into the story well.Acting. Really well done. Keanu Reeves does his Hi I'm Keanu Reeves acting by standing,staring and blinking and people just go up and admire him like artwork. Lawrence Fishburne is ace as Morpheus and one of the best bad asses i have seen on the screen in a while. The others are mediocre but the star of the show goes to Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith. I love Smith as a baddie. Just his personality and presence on screen was a complete stand out from the crowd.The action sequences were also original and impressive to watch,especially the final scene between Agent Smith and Neo. If you haven't seen the sequels then they have more in the future. The slow motion stuff is also well shot and well documented into the film. The Special Effects gave the film a personality in my eyes like no other film did before.Overall what can i say. I enjoyed The Matrix now and i will certainly get my teeth into Matrix 2 and Matrix 3 (Which i haven't seen yet...except the ending)Overall Rating - 67% - B - *** Stars ","genre":null},{"date":"15 September 2013","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":" Connor Macgregor Reviews...The MatrixI have only seen The Matrix once and that was when i was about 10 or 11 and i had seen Matrix 2 first.

The wonderful acting,story and location work really gave the film something magical that puts it in the group of Gone With The Wind and The GodfatherIn the early years of World War II, the Moroccan city of Casablanca attracts people from all over. Many are transients trying to get out of Europe; a few are just trying to make a buck. Most of them -- gamblers and refugees, Nazis, resistance fighters, and plain old crooks -- find their way to Rick's Café Américain, a swank nightclub owned by American expatriate Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart). Though we learn later that Rick once harboured enough idealism to put himself at risk to fight fascism, he's now embittered and cynical, professing to be neutral and detached I stick my neck out for nobody.What i love about this film is Humphrey Bogart. His ability to put himself firmly in a role and believe in it is extraordinary. I think Rick Blaine is one of the most cool and charming characters on the screen. Ilsa is also a true beauty on the screen. You can really feel for the love between Rick & Ilsa and how they will die for each other if it became possible. But in the end, their love can conquer all only not together and that is one of the most touching scenes in cinema when they have their final conversation.The ending stands out as one of the best in Cinema. That infamous final quote Louis,I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship summed up my love for this film and what it achieved now and then.Casablanca is a true cinematic classic and must be watched by all people.Rating - 100% - A+ - ***** Stars ","genre":null},{"date":"15 September 2013","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Connor Macgregor Reviews...CasablancaI have just finished watching Casablanca which has now become in my eyes, a true cinematic classic.
