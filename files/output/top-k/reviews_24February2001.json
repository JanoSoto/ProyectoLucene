The then 18 year old actress Sofia Coppola as Mary Corleone, who brings about a sweet innocence to the film, who frankly I fell in love with from the moment I saw that scene with Michael dancing with her. Lastly, the tragic Shakespeareanesque ending brings the Corleone family to its final end. Yes, Coppola and Puzo impressed me in their third outing. I have seen the negative comments about this film, and it's the same old garbage you always see concerning sequels. People always try to compare them to the original movie, and in the process they miss out on the great work of art that the sequel is. Lastly, I must say that Pacino was at his greatest in this film. I never thought of him as in the same league as people like DeNiro or Brando, even after watching the first 2 films. But this film changed my mind forever. He brought Michael Corleone to a level rarely achieved by any actor in any movie, much less a sequel, and he has my utmost respect, and I agree with another reviewer who said it was a shame he was passed for an Oscar. But there's nothing new under the sun there, as the Academy hasn't learned anything about rewarding truly great performances.

People unfamiliar with the conflict will walk away with this general assumption--especially given the common knowlege that the Serbs participated very prominently in the three other Yugoslav wars.  But the war was far more complex than that, and no single film has yet to show the startling array of dimensions that fueled the violence in Bosnia in the 90s; none manages to place the violence in a historical context.  Underground came close, and the last sequence of Ulysses' Gaze gave it a good try, but it wasn't really there.  (Crowd favorite Pretty Village Pretty Flame simply wasn't a good movie, whatever its intentions might have been.) Taken together, though, a picture of Bosnia begins to emerge--one that is decidedly dire and bloody, but one that at least suggests how complex the war was.  Round it out with Vukovar and Cabaret Balkan and you'll have a home video film festival guaranteed to make you kill yourself.  Until someone makes a film about pre-war Sarajevo, with its vibrant multi-ethnic communities, cosmopolitan sophistication, elegant boulevards, and generous hospitality (and am I the only one who remembers the Sarajevo Olympics?), cinematic Bosnia will have to be this violent wasteland of human pride and depravity.On pure film-geek terms, Welcome to Sarajevo is a meandering story that doesn't really seem to know what it wants to be is it a story about gonzo journalists, or about the rescue of a little girl, or about war atrocities? The gonzo journalist angle lasts for about a half hour, and then promptly goes away.  Then there's the plot line about the rescue of the girl, which appears somewhat arbitrarily a little late in the game.  Once that angle's resolved the movie keeps chugging along, with a thoroughly inconsequential return trip to Bosnia that serves little dramatic purpose except to kill off another character.  The war atrocities thread runs throughout the film, but never gels into a story of its own.  Given Woody Harrelson's top-billing and his grand entrance, you'd think he and his antics would be important...but they're not.  Too many of the scenes go nowhere (did I have to see the bus pulling over so the kids could sleep?  I think I could have figured out on my own that children sleep at night); scenes that seem important end up not being so, and some scenes that should be important are utterly forgettable. But still, the prolonged bus ride is dreadful to watch (in the good way--kids in danger, can't beat that for drama), and seeing the girl prancing about the English garden wearing a cute dress and a bow in her hair was enough to give me a sense of relief.Final note I can understand the outrage any Serb would feel watching this film.  But in a way, maybe that's the point.  Everyone should be outraged. Not by the one-sided depiction of the war, but by the fact that the Serbs did commit unspeakable atrocities in Bosnia and Croatia...as did the Croats and the Muslims (yes, even the victims took a generous shot at being the monsters).  Emira could have been from any one of those groups, and children and adults from all sides of this spectacularly multi-sided war suffered the same as she did.  The only other group that gets bad-mouthed in this film is the West.  Of the many participants and guilty parties in Bosnia, it is important to realize that not all were Bosnian.

There was a lot of the plot incorporated in the film and that there was a lot of drama and comedy in the film as well.The action scenes were fabulous. The motorcycle chase and the car chase were really enjoyable. I also loved the script. Bruce Feirstein and company made a great script with an interesting plot. It was a great choice from MGM to have Roger Spottiswoode as the director of TND. He had all the scenes made to near perfection. The acting had its good and bad points sadly. Pierce Brosnan was superb as always. He really wasn't relaxed in GoldenEye but in TND, he was as cool as ice. Elliot Carver has to be the most cheesy villian in Bond history. I thought Jonathan Pryce would knock some sense into Carver, but just made Carver even cheesier. Teri Hatcher was lame as Paris Carver. All she did was make Paris into a wimpy sex kitten.The best thing in all of TND had to be Wai-Lin. Michelle Yeoh steals the show in TND. She was the perfect Bond girl.

At first I heard mixed reviews of it and was hesitant to see it. As it turns out the movie isn't that bad. One of the first things that came to my mind were A Christmas Carol with Scrooge.I loved the way the movie opened with Nick and Tea (Jack and Kate) saying goodbye at the airport...of course the viewer knows they aren't going to see each other.  We are then brought to the future where Jack is the President of a powerful investment house and Kate is a lawyer doing well on her own. The reason I think of scrooge is that Jack has no concept of family, only of work, he makes his staff come in on Christmas and makes them work Christmas eve. Well it just so happens that on Christmas Eve he meets what one might assume is 'an angel' we don't actually know who he is, and the next morning Jack wakes up in the life he would have had if he hadn't gone to London.This was my favorite part, as it shows that love can be more valuable than money and real success comes at home, from your family, not from your job and position.Yes it is a feel good movie, and I guess that is why I liked it, it really made me feel good.

Images everywhere, several languages untranslated, lots of naked men and women.  When it went to video, I rented it one lonely night because I was horny and I could at least remember the movie had a lot of nudity and sex.  On a somewhat more sober viewing of *Pillow Book* at home, I became committed to the movie for a month or so. I wrote a rather long paper on it for a feminism class.  Writing and thinking about it sent me into euphorias not unlike the ones portrayed in the film.(For those who haven't seen the movie, the following paragraph is not a synopsis, though not a spoiler either.)Put in a rather windy, but as brief a way as possible, I believed Greenaway to be expressing a complex message through the movie. On the one hand, today's Western society, as opposed to, say, traditional Japanese society, offers the woman freedom to be the pen and not just the paper (Ewan McGregor's character, Jerome, offers this express possibility to Vivian Wu's character, Nagiko, that she write on him rather than the opposite). In this way, woman breaks free of her assigned roles, often submissive (an assignment evident when the father gives the young Nagiko her identity by writing on her at the beginning of the film).  But at the same time, this same Western society fosters, more negatively, a commercialistic environment which has lost the rich meaning that tradition and ritual provides.  But, I think Greenaway means to persuade us, the good elements of both sorts of society can co-exist, judging by what I take to be a happy ending for Nagiko (sorry, shouldn't give it away).  In the end, she is both empowered and able to lead a meaningful, traditional lifestyle.  In this blending of cultures, there is also no loss of natural female eroticism, like that found in the original Pillow Book.I think there are many other points made by the film, and I don't mean to anaesthetically boil down the movie to any of them.  I mention these to show (whether you like the background theory or not) that there definitely are at least a few major points in the film and that, also, the film definitely can be seen as having a resolution.

Also, even if I read the above analysis into the movie and, say, Greenaway wouldn't do so, the film has point and shows great depth of consciousness and self-consciousness on Greenaway's part in simply being amenable to such challenging interpretation.This was the first of Greenaway's movies I'd seen, so when I discovered there were others by him, I tried to see at least a few.  Earlier movies, *The Cook, the Thief...* and *Prospero's Books* seemed to me early attempts to convey the themes to be better mastered in *Pillow Book* writing vs. body, vulgarity vs. sensuality, etc.  I was pleased to see that his great concern, in these two movies, with incorporating stagelike qualities into cinematography dissolves, in the *Pillow Book*, into intense and omnipresent image frame play, a technique which more greatly utilizes what is peculiar to the medium of cinema.  I also rushed to see Greenaway's more recent *8 1\/2 Women*, but thought it a step down from the *Pillow Book* epiphany. But maybe that's the, or a, point made by the movie.

It is remarkable that there is not one comment comparing The Pledge with its predecessor. `In the Cold Light of Day' is not a perfect movie but the plot and characters hold together better than in `The Pledge'. Things make more sense - the mother coming to live with (basically) a total stranger (and she IS aware of the child killings), reasons for the child to disregard the warnings about talking with strangers, a motive for why the killer kills, and there IS a killer in the first movie. Perdita Weeks as the child is remarkable in the first movie.The previous movie was filmed in Eastern Europe with scenery astonishingly like the scenery in `The Pledge'. The beginning of both movies is very similar and it is a deju vu experience. Once into the movie, `The Pledge' takes its own mountain road and I do not need to go into discrepancies in `The Pledge' that should not have happened, since other posters have already done so. There are many weaknesses yet there are great strengths in `The Pledge'. Sean Penn has constructed some wonderful performances from his actors. Most notably, Vanessa Redgrave and Mickey Rourke. Sean Penn has achieved something no other director has ever accomplished, he finally got an exceptional performance out of Mickey 'insipid smile' Rourke. I may even have changed my opinion about Mr. Rourke's acting ability after seeing this movie. With the exception of Mickey Rourke's presentation, even the exceptional performances do not hold the film together when inserted into the whole of it. Although Ms. Redgrave's performance was superb, I also got the opposite feeling from her characterization - that she just didn't give a damn about anything. Robin Wright's performance also left that dichotomous sensation - she may have liked Jack Nicholson's character but maybe not really. There is no chemistry between them. I almost got the feeling that Sean Penn was offering up his wife to his pal Jack Nicholson at one point - just for friendship's sake. In previous films, whenever Ms. Wright is on-screen there is a light, a radiance - she glows on the screen. Somehow, her light was smothered in this movie. To her credit, she must have amazing self-confidence to play a snaggle-toothed, greasy-haired, dim-witted character, especially with all those close-ups; however, her character just didn't come off.And to Sean Penn's great credit, in his rendering of `The Pledge' he did not do what had already been done with Friedrich Durrenmatt's book and in `In the Cold Light of Day' - he took the song and made it his own.Sean Penn is not underrated or undervalued by those with wits or even half-wits. He is a superbly accomplished actor and director. Of course he should have won the Oscar for `Dead Man Walking'. And some day he'll get what he should have been his. But I don't feel it should be for this movie. ","genre":null},{"date":"24 February 2001","score":"","review":"  This one line summary is the tagline for In the Cold Light of Day (1994 with Richard Grant and Lynsey Baxter in the Jack Nicholson \/ Robin Wright parts), book by the same author and it's the same movie with different actors.  It is remarkable that there is not one comment comparing The Pledge with its predecessor. `In the Cold Light of Day' is not a perfect movie but the plot and characters hold together better than in `The Pledge'. Things make more sense - the mother coming to live with (basically) a total stranger (and she IS aware of the child killings), reasons for the child to disregard the warnings about talking with strangers, a motive for why the killer kills, and there IS a killer in the first movie. Perdita Weeks as the child is remarkable in the first movie.The previous movie was filmed in Eastern Europe with scenery astonishingly like the scenery in `The Pledge'. The beginning of both movies is very similar and it is a deju vu experience. Once into the movie, `The Pledge' takes its own mountain road and I do not need to go into discrepancies in `The Pledge' that should not have happened, since other posters have already done so. There are many weaknesses yet there are great strengths in `The Pledge'. Sean Penn has constructed some wonderful performances from his actors. Most notably, Vanessa Redgrave and Mickey Rourke. Sean Penn has achieved something no other director has ever accomplished, he finally got an exceptional performance out of Mickey 'insipid smile' Rourke. I may even have changed my opinion about Mr. Rourke's acting ability after seeing this movie. With the exception of Mickey Rourke's presentation, even the exceptional performances do not hold the film together when inserted into the whole of it. Although Ms. Redgrave's performance was superb, I also got the opposite feeling from her characterization - that she just didn't give a damn about anything. Robin Wright's performance also left that dichotomous sensation - she may have liked Jack Nicholson's character but maybe not really. There is no chemistry between them.
