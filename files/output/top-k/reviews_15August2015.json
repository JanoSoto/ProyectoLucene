No-no! I am not a fan and I've dispassionately checked 2 from combobox just because this movie is really awful. Why? OK. Here we go! Creating science fiction (SCIENCE!) movie has to be fantasy based on reality, not on unrestrained minds of writers or your 5-year old son. So, what we've got here? Story sucks and don't tell me it's OK, it's just... cant describe how bad it is. Ah, OK, not bad for five year old boy! Characters sucks. For example marines are defective imbeciles, not a soldiers. Screenplay is awful cliché, cliché, cliché... omg, so many clichés (yes, I know it's '86). But it's OK for 80-90 minutes... It's 137 minutes long. Daddy asked me to let you all know that the theatre is closing. We are all being sick!

Kids might find the movie enjoyable. Maybe. But viewed through the eyes of an adult the movie is a flop. The script is dire, the acting is rather terrible, a number of the characters serve no purpose while other characters serve only to annoy. And the supposed great adventure our young heroes go on is not even particularly interesting. There is very little excitement to be had here, honestly this is a rather boring movie.The story follows a group of kids as they search for long-lost pirate treasure. A very simple plot but that would be OK if this treasure hunt was exciting. It is not. The kids find many obstacles in their way. There are booby traps to get through and some hapless villains on their tail. It all becomes repetitive rather quickly. Make your way through this trap, then that trap, then another trap. All along the way spout terrible dialogue and in many instances have many kids spouting that terrible dialogue all at the same time. These kids talk, and scream, over one another for two hours. Get me an aspirin. The acting is completely unconvincing. Child actors are capable of great performances. Not in this movie. We get grating performances from the whole lot of them. Sean Astin, playing the leader of the group, is probably most annoying of all though Ke Huy Quan, who you may remember as the incredibly annoying kid from Temple of Doom, runs him close. There are a couple of girls tossed into the proceedings and they add absolutely nothing. Meanwhile the villains are total duds. There is very little good to say here. This is one dull, empty adventure.
