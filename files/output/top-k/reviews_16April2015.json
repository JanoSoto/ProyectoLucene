","genre":"Comedy, Drama"},{"date":"16 April 2015","score":"","review":" After winning Oscars for Forrest Gump, star Tom Hanks and director Robert Zemeckis teamed up for a 2000 epic called Cast Away, a compelling and well-made drama but, for me, a very difficult film to watch, with minimal re-watch appeal.Hanks plays Chuck Noland, an executive with Federal Express whose life is changed forever when he is involved in a plane crash, which he survives and ends up stranded on a deserted island for four years. No episode of Gilligan's Island here as we watch this man, initially in denial about what has happened to him, anticipating rescue in a few days but as time passes, he can no longer deny what is happening to him and must learn how to survive, while simultaneously trying to cling to his sanity, evidenced in an actual relationship he develops with a volleyball, which he names Wilson and takes care of like a newborn baby.This film is challenging because it goes places where other plane crash dramas have never gone. For example, there is a horrific moment when Chuck actually discovers the body of the pilot of the plane and goes through his wallet. I don't ever remember a film like this where the body of someone who didn't survive was even mentioned let alone revealed. The film also takes its time in having Chuck accept his plight. I like the way Chuck keeps his clothes on initially because he really thinks he's going to be found quickly, but eventually he starts wearing less and less to the point where he is just in a loin cloth and his pants are now covering his head. Even common health issues come to the surface here when Chuck develops a toothache and has no choice but to pull the tooth out himself, a scene I literally cannot watch anymore.Director Zemeckis employs a keen eye for detail and realism here...this film contains what is probably the most frighteningly realistic plane crash I have ever seen in a movie. The moments before the plane hits, the panic in the pilots voices, Chuck's iron-fisted clutch of a picture of his fiancée (Helen Hunt), it all rang true and was just horrifying to watch and when Chuck was literally underwater trying to fight his way out of the plane, I was literally holding my own breath. Another Zemeckis touch to ensure realism is that after the initial scenes up to the plane crash were filmed, he shut down production of the film for a couple of months to give Hanks time to lose 30 pounds, to make his desperate diving for fish in the ocean look more desperately authentic and to show that Chuck was no longer eating regularly.Zemeckis also knows how to make his viewer squirm, particularly in his depiction of Chuck's relationship with Wilson...the moment when Wilson falls off the raft and Chuck is unable to save him is heartbreaking and pathetic. You feel for Chuck while at the same time, you can't help but think, Uh...it's a volleyball.One of my absolute favorite cinematic pictures occurs in this film as well...the shot of Chuck's raft quietly floating in the ocean as a giant ship floats by right next to him.This film is beautifully made and tells a very difficult story. Tom Hanks received a richly deserved Oscar nomination and Helen Hunt makes the most of her small role as his confused fiancée, but this film is really hard to watch.

","genre":null},{"date":"16 April 2015","score":"","review":" After winning Oscars for Forrest Gump, star Tom Hanks and director Robert Zemeckis teamed up for a 2000 epic called Cast Away, a compelling and well-made drama but, for me, a very difficult film to watch, with minimal re-watch appeal.Hanks plays Chuck Noland, an executive with Federal Express whose life is changed forever when he is involved in a plane crash, which he survives and ends up stranded on a deserted island for four years. No episode of Gilligan's Island here as we watch this man, initially in denial about what has happened to him, anticipating rescue in a few days but as time passes, he can no longer deny what is happening to him and must learn how to survive, while simultaneously trying to cling to his sanity, evidenced in an actual relationship he develops with a volleyball, which he names Wilson and takes care of like a newborn baby.This film is challenging because it goes places where other plane crash dramas have never gone. For example, there is a horrific moment when Chuck actually discovers the body of the pilot of the plane and goes through his wallet. I don't ever remember a film like this where the body of someone who didn't survive was even mentioned let alone revealed. The film also takes its time in having Chuck accept his plight. I like the way Chuck keeps his clothes on initially because he really thinks he's going to be found quickly, but eventually he starts wearing less and less to the point where he is just in a loin cloth and his pants are now covering his head. Even common health issues come to the surface here when Chuck develops a toothache and has no choice but to pull the tooth out himself, a scene I literally cannot watch anymore.Director Zemeckis employs a keen eye for detail and realism here...this film contains what is probably the most frighteningly realistic plane crash I have ever seen in a movie. The moments before the plane hits, the panic in the pilots voices, Chuck's iron-fisted clutch of a picture of his fiancée (Helen Hunt), it all rang true and was just horrifying to watch and when Chuck was literally underwater trying to fight his way out of the plane, I was literally holding my own breath. Another Zemeckis touch to ensure realism is that after the initial scenes up to the plane crash were filmed, he shut down production of the film for a couple of months to give Hanks time to lose 30 pounds, to make his desperate diving for fish in the ocean look more desperately authentic and to show that Chuck was no longer eating regularly.Zemeckis also knows how to make his viewer squirm, particularly in his depiction of Chuck's relationship with Wilson...the moment when Wilson falls off the raft and Chuck is unable to save him is heartbreaking and pathetic. You feel for Chuck while at the same time, you can't help but think, Uh...it's a volleyball.One of my absolute favorite cinematic pictures occurs in this film as well...the shot of Chuck's raft quietly floating in the ocean as a giant ship floats by right next to him.This film is beautifully made and tells a very difficult story.

Con Air is a movie that is just re-watchable no matter how many times you watch it. This is a movie that has everything I love about Action filmsgreat Action,memorable characters and great lines that are catchy all within a Die Hard type storyline with a very good twist,instead of terrorists taking over building it's prisoners taking over a plane. Another thing I also love about Con Air is that the movie never takes itself too seriously because it's a movie that is big,loud and over the top meaning that the film isn't going to win any Oscars,get tons of acclaim from major film critics or give viewers thought provoking story that is important,it's an Action movie for Action lovers. The movie also doesn't take itself too seriously because of the Humor thanks to the main and supporting characters(some who are straight forward and others who are weird and nutty)and with moments and scenes of wildness and fun. The Action scenes in Con Air are amazing,fast and intense and when you see the Action you don't want it to stop. There is tons of Action and more with gunfights,fist fights,explosions and heck there's even a car chase sequence and each of the Action scenes are big,in your face and done in Jerry Bruckheimer's style of quick and slow motion because like in any Jerry Bruckheimer production everything is far and beyond it's limits and the pace goes from 5 to 100 in seconds. The Action scenes will have Action fans glued to the screen and craving for more. The main character Cameron Poe is the tradition Action hero he's a one-man Army who is strong willed using his fists as well as his brains and can kick anyone's butt in the entire film but he's does it for a reason and that is to get home and see his wife and daughter. You also like Cameron because of his honor and loyalty to not only people but to certain principles and ideals that is true to his nature. You will root for Cameron Poe to survive and beat the bad guys. The ending of Con Air is outstanding and is filled with terrific Action and thrills that will have you cheering at the screen. A wonderful conclusion.The cast is wonderful. Nicolas Cage is excellent and at his best as Cameron Poe,with Cage kicking butt with a Southern accent and mullet. John Cusack is terrific as Vince Larkin,a U.S Marshall. John Malkovich is brilliant and at his best as Cyrus 'The Virus' Grissom,one of my favorite Action movie villains with Malkovich being charismatic and evil. Steve Buscemi is delightful as Garland 'The Marietta Mangler' Greene,a serial killer. Ving Rhames is great as Nathan 'Diamond Dog',Cyrus' partner in crime.

","genre":"Action, Crime, Thriller"},{"date":"16 April 2015","score":"","review":" Based on the 1982 novella The Body by Stephen King, this is an excellent coming of age drama, perhaps the best that I have seen, wonderfully directed by Rob Reiner. Of course, King is best known for his horror stories which is why I imagine that the title was changed. If I saw a headline about a film called The Body written by Stephen King, this is not the kind of story that would immediately spring to mind and I doubt that I would be alone in that. I have never read the novella so I don't know how much or how little the screenwriters Raynold Gideon and Bruce A. Evans added to it. In any event, the writing and characterisation are superlative. Being 12 to 13 years old is an awkward, difficult phase in everyone's life for reasons that are many and obvious and the film perfectly portrays it from the male perspective. The four boys all seem like real people and the dialogue always seems like real conversation rather than lines in a film. I remember very well doing and saying things along the same lines as Gordie, Chris, Teddy and Vern when I was their age. Of the four characters in question, I probably relate most to Gordie as I was awkward, shy and nerdy at that age, though thankfully I had and have loving, supportive parents rather than emotionally distant, neglectful ones. Since I have never been the bravest soul, I also relate to Vern to some degree. The way that the boys interact is so authentic as well. It's a brilliant and completely realistic depiction of male friendships, both the close and tempestuous varieties, in my experience. I loved the fact that it did not attempt to sanitise anything. It feels like the actual 1950s rather than the film and TV version of the 1950s.Of course, not all of the film's success can be attributed to the writing. If the four boys had been played by horrendous stage school types, the film would not have worth much in spite of how good the script is. However, Rob Reiner had a great eye for casting and River Phoenix, Wil Wheaton, Corey Feldman and Jerry O'Connell all deliver excellent performances. I don't just mean that they were excellent for child actors. I mean that they were excellent full stop. Wheaton attributes this to the fact that all four of them were essentially the same as the characters that they were playing. This is seen most clearly with Phoenix as the cool, wise beyond his years, intelligent and passionate Chris. Sadly, life imitated art in that both River Phoenix and Chris died young when they could have accomplished so much more. While this was neither his first acting role nor his first film, it brought him widespread attention and started him on the course to a very successful acting career that was cut tragically short. Really, it's so surprise that the other three young actors went on to have good careers in the years that followed with Jerry O'Connell's being the best of the three. Wil Wheaton gives the performance of his life as Gordie, who is grief stricken at the death of his beloved older brother Denny and feels neglected by his parents. His chemistry with River Phoenix hits all the right notes. It's a shame that Wesley Crusher was such an irritant as he could have done great work with a good character and good writing in Star Trek The Next Generation. As Teddy, Cory Feldman is suitably irritating for much of the film but, in spite of that, he never fails to be a sympathetic character. He's an understandably angry young boy from a dysfunctional family who has suffered more in 12 years than many people suffer in their whole lives. Vern is perhaps the most normal character and therefore least interesting of the four but Jerry O'Connell, who will always be Quinn Mallory to me, excels in the role as the kindhearted and put upon boy. The film also benefits from a strong supporting cast, particularly Kiefer Sutherland (who, in contrast to my love for his father Donald's acting, I don't usually like) as one of the most frightening film bullies, Casey Siemaszko, John Cusack, Marshall Bell and Bruce Kirby. The always wonderful Richard Dreyfuss was an inspired choice for the adult Gordie. In addition to his perfect casting choices, Rob Reiner's talent as a director is demonstrated by the beautiful way in which the film is shot. He makes great use of the Oregon scenery and other locations throughout the film and I don't think that there is a single shot in the film that does not work.

While this was neither his first acting role nor his first film, it brought him widespread attention and started him on the course to a very successful acting career that was cut tragically short. Really, it's so surprise that the other three young actors went on to have good careers in the years that followed with Jerry O'Connell's being the best of the three. Wil Wheaton gives the performance of his life as Gordie, who is grief stricken at the death of his beloved older brother Denny and feels neglected by his parents. His chemistry with River Phoenix hits all the right notes. It's a shame that Wesley Crusher was such an irritant as he could have done great work with a good character and good writing in Star Trek The Next Generation. As Teddy, Cory Feldman is suitably irritating for much of the film but, in spite of that, he never fails to be a sympathetic character. He's an understandably angry young boy from a dysfunctional family who has suffered more in 12 years than many people suffer in their whole lives. Vern is perhaps the most normal character and therefore least interesting of the four but Jerry O'Connell, who will always be Quinn Mallory to me, excels in the role as the kindhearted and put upon boy. The film also benefits from a strong supporting cast, particularly Kiefer Sutherland (who, in contrast to my love for his father Donald's acting, I don't usually like) as one of the most frightening film bullies, Casey Siemaszko, John Cusack, Marshall Bell and Bruce Kirby. The always wonderful Richard Dreyfuss was an inspired choice for the adult Gordie. In addition to his perfect casting choices, Rob Reiner's talent as a director is demonstrated by the beautiful way in which the film is shot. He makes great use of the Oregon scenery and other locations throughout the film and I don't think that there is a single shot in the film that does not work. ","genre":"Adventure, Drama"},{"date":"16 April 2015","score":"","review":" Based on the 1982 novella The Body by Stephen King, this is an excellent coming of age drama, perhaps the best that I have seen, wonderfully directed by Rob Reiner. Of course, King is best known for his horror stories which is why I imagine that the title was changed. If I saw a headline about a film called The Body written by Stephen King, this is not the kind of story that would immediately spring to mind and I doubt that I would be alone in that. I have never read the novella so I don't know how much or how little the screenwriters Raynold Gideon and Bruce A. Evans added to it. In any event, the writing and characterisation are superlative. Being 12 to 13 years old is an awkward, difficult phase in everyone's life for reasons that are many and obvious and the film perfectly portrays it from the male perspective. The four boys all seem like real people and the dialogue always seems like real conversation rather than lines in a film. I remember very well doing and saying things along the same lines as Gordie, Chris, Teddy and Vern when I was their age. Of the four characters in question, I probably relate most to Gordie as I was awkward, shy and nerdy at that age, though thankfully I had and have loving, supportive parents rather than emotionally distant, neglectful ones. Since I have never been the bravest soul, I also relate to Vern to some degree. The way that the boys interact is so authentic as well. It's a brilliant and completely realistic depiction of male friendships, both the close and tempestuous varieties, in my experience. I loved the fact that it did not attempt to sanitise anything. It feels like the actual 1950s rather than the film and TV version of the 1950s.Of course, not all of the film's success can be attributed to the writing. If the four boys had been played by horrendous stage school types, the film would not have worth much in spite of how good the script is. However, Rob Reiner had a great eye for casting and River Phoenix, Wil Wheaton, Corey Feldman and Jerry O'Connell all deliver excellent performances. I don't just mean that they were excellent for child actors. I mean that they were excellent full stop. Wheaton attributes this to the fact that all four of them were essentially the same as the characters that they were playing. This is seen most clearly with Phoenix as the cool, wise beyond his years, intelligent and passionate Chris. Sadly, life imitated art in that both River Phoenix and Chris died young when they could have accomplished so much more.

It is beautiful and appealing to both children and adults.The story is not historically accurate, but I would think any adult, even the ones not familiar with Russian history at all would sense that there is no truth in Rasputin selling his soul to put a curse on Romanovs. Yet I am sure this beautiful movie would awake interest in people regardless of age to find out more about it. And it is also obvious why. Which kids would want to sit through the details that lead to Russian revolution, the main story of the movie isn't that anyways but the legend of Anastasia.The greatest strength of this movie is the animation. It is so beautifully mastered together with amazing colors and use of shadow. They also went a big way to be accurate in details when it comes to the settings, mainly the palaces. The story takes mainly place in St Petersburg and Paris and both places get a spirit about them I was especially in love with Russian scenery. So much magic and beauty about it. Not just in the palace but the beautiful snowy are out of the city as well.The cast to give voices to the characters is amazing. Angela Lansbury was a perfect choice for the Empress Marie. All the other main characters were also very impressive considering their star status.The music is another important element for the movie. The songs have a big variety and are beautifully sung. My personal favorite is Once Upon a December. They also did so well with collaboration the voices of the singers with those of the actors. Except for Kelsey Grammar who as I read mastered to sing Vladimir's songs on his own. I would love to go see it on stage as a musical.And as I sad it is a wonderful movie for both kids and adults. It follows a well known princess movie formula which children love. But even so the main princess is an exceptionally strong female character who does a lot of brave things in the movie and for the most wants to find herself and her roots. The evil scenes of the movie are also appealing to children, Rasputin's character was sure created to entertain them including the little bat that is his buddy.

Around this time councilar Sue Snell (Amy Irving) begins to see something in Rachel that she saw years earlier in Carrie White. Soon Rachel has a star football player (Jason London) after her but another group has other plans for her.THE RAGE CARRIE 2 is a rather confusing film on many levels. The obvious thing is why was a sequel even needed to the Brian DePalma masterpiece? This film is the perfect example of why I always say remakes are a lot more original than sequels because this thing here has very little connection to the original movie and what's here is downright stupid on many logical areas. This so-called sequel is basically just a poor rehash of all of the events in the film film, which is really too bad because so much more could have been done with this thing but sadly we're left with an incredibly dull and rather lifeless horror film.What made CARRIE so wonderful is that it was basically a teenage drama with some very strong horror elements. There's really no drama going on with this film because the screenplay just has one cliché after another and what's worse is that so much of it is boring or just unbelievable. Not for a second was the game being played by the football players something interesting or evil enough to where you get drawn into the story. What's even sillier is the Rachel character and her powers that really don't come out until the end.

However the boys find that they get more than they bargained for when their creation called Lisa (Kelly LeBrock) enters into their lives and immediately makes a big impact on them.This film worked for me in so many ways and the first thing I liked about this film is that it's a fun piece of escapism. When growing up, how many young men wouldn't have wanted to create a beautiful woman and then find out that said beautiful woman was there to guide them through their adolescence. How much simpler would life be if we all had a Kelly LeBrock by our side.The second more obvious thing that was good about this film is that it quite simply was funny; I wouldn't go as far as saying that it was consistently funny, but when the gags came they hit the right note and I was pleasantly surprised that the film was much less vulgar than I was expecting. I thought that Chet's comeuppance at the end was particularly surprising and amusing. Gary's early scene when he's in the bar trying to emulate the style of the 'black' guys was also funny, but again that scene was funny in a way that was neither crude or offensive. The best character in this film was undoubtedly Chet who kind of reminded me of an 80's version of Stifler from American Pie.

Essentially it's a coming of age film with a few life lessons thrown in for good measure. What also makes this work is that for me it never felt preachy or ever felt like the point was being forced home. Whether you were a nerdish character growing up like Gary or Wyatt or a jock like Ian or Max it's a film that many people can relate to and I think that's ultimately what makes it work so well.If you can look past the embarrassingly dated special effects then there's really very little wrong with this film.

This film speaks to the younger generation; informing them of the dangers of not turning into the person they want to be, but instead, turning into what others want them to be. Even today, The Graduate is very appropriate and its theme is applicable. The story easily attracts today's viewers since at one time or another we all have questioned where our lives were heading. The Simon and Garfunkel songs which provide the soundtrack are a terrific addition to the film as they fit in perfectly with what is happening on the screen. This film was clever and very well made.

(I also wonder if kids' attention might wander during these sequences...)I am, of course, a cinephile now, but was I at age 10, when my brothers and I watched this back in the 1970's, broadcast by a UHF TV station out of Youngstown, Ohio?

It is a clever mix of Suessian imagery and the anxieties of childhood (which adults remember better than we admit) contained within the forms and conventions of the 1950's Hollywood musical. The cast is excellent, particularly the dancers, but credit should be distributed all around. Mary Healy is very sexy as Bart's mother, and her real-life husband, Peter Lind Hayes, portrays the kind of adult every kid wishes he knew. Hans Conried, at what turned out to the pinnacle of his career, is perfect. Even Bart, played by Tommy Rettig is good (child actors are often very hard to stomach). Almost the entire film is an extended dream sequence, showing life for a young boy inside a surreal fortress of mandatory piano lessons, and where strict, autocratic order is enforced by a legion of uniformed, thuggish soldiers. Very obvious to my adult self, it is a commentary on authoritarianism and totalitarianism, in the world of an American child. It is interesting to consider that the year of this film's release, 1953, was the peak of the Senator Joe McCarthy witch-hunts. The following year, theocratic authoritarians successfully pressured the US Congress into mandating the phrase 'one nation under God' into the Pledge of Allegiance, which was itself an oath forced upon millions of schoolchildren 5 days a week. Among many memorable moments is a solo titled 'Because We're Kids,' containing this verse 'Now just because your throat has got a deeper voice, And lots of wind to blow it out, At little kids who dare not shout, You have no right, you have no right, To boss and beat us little kids about...'So, as I said before, this film will not be 'accessible' to everyone.

And so to try and make that traumatic experience light, is honestly a very white privilege thing to do. One thing this film captured very well was the political unrest. While you had the peace treaty signed by the two nations, USA and Iraq, it was very hard to trust that as an American soldier or an Iraqi soldier. You had to put all your trust and faith that the other person would uphold that treaty with you. That is one thing the three main characters challenge, is the ethics of the peace treaty, and ultimately it being us or them.

Mark Wahlberg, still in one of his best roles, plays the troubled street kid, who earns the name Dirk Diggler, with his discovered talent who's approached by Reynolds, a big time porn director, in one of his best ever acting parts. The two form a friendship, where Dirk becomes a friend among many other crew and cast, and becomes the next big thing. The period of late 70's to the breaking of the eighties is well captured and unhurried. Everyone is great where Wahlberg, competes well against some real acting heavy weights, (you'll know who I mean). Exceptionally good, was Julianne Moore, fantastic as a B porn actress fighting a lot of demons, only finding solace and happiness in what she's doing, while really she's floundering in despair, as fighting boldly to gain custody of her son. This film shows you what happens to retired porn stars, when seeking a new career or dream. One such instance threw me into a shockingly momentary disillusion. But this film is very inspirational, and how it tells you to Never give up on your dream, especially in Dirk Diggler's case. There is a couple of coincidences in this film I didn't buy, and a little of repetition, hampering the great film, but the hampering really just becomes void, as we we don't have to forgive it, the films so good. One example involves a washed up Dirk Diggler getting pummelled by some gay hating punks, in a car park, while just after a limo just so happens to roll past with Burt and hot Heather Graham ( Rollergirl who never takes her skates off- EVER- I like that) getting it on with a high school jock who use to diss her. Shortly after, she in a much deserved revenge, as well as one I lapped up (You go girl) starts mashing the guy's face with her skates, after an offended Burt that is, tackles and punches him. There is some explosive violence, including one shock suicide scene, that's Wild Bill's doing, but like the sex, it's in the small number. My favorite scene is the one near the end, in an edgy, drug\/money exchanged with a coked up Alfred Molina, as an young Asian kid, intermittently letting off firecrackers to intensify the nervousness, enwrapping Dirk Diggler and co (mo wearing Thomas Jane, you'll hardly recognize here, in still what I consider his best acting. BN is one hell of a movie ride and one of the best films of 1998. I have so much good stuff to write on this, but this is such a small offering. If you forgive the faults I mentioned, just sit back and watch what is a rewarding and insightful look into a industry was shunned, but it's how we see these shunned people lived, partied and boogied. The stick out hampering part is the ridiculous elongated penis, Marky Mark reveals at the end. Not only is it patently fake, it could do the Markster some mischief if tripping over it.

Robert Hays, Julie Hagerty, Robert Stack, Llyod Bridges and Peter Graves all put in hilliariously funny performances, complete with great deadpan acting, and that Johnny guy in the control room played by the late Stephen Stucker is also hiliraiously funny, even though I think some of his lines have aged very badly. I also found the dialogue between the pilots as the plane was taking off to be very funny as was the jive talking by the African American actors in this funny movie, the most memorable quote from this movie is in the cockpit when Ted Striker says Surely you can't be serious' to which Dr Rummick replies with ' I am serious and don't call me Shirley'. That is very funny.
