But anyone who thinks they are just watching a well drawn cartoon is missing most of what is going on.  This is one of the most sophisticated and mature science fiction films of all time. I put it right up there with 2001 A Space Odyssey and Blade Runner.The movie opens with what looks like a computer chip but as it zooms in resolves into a city seen from above at night.  Then it cuts to a beautiful woman standing on top of a building in the city.  This is 'The Major'. Although she looks very soft and feminine and wearing practically nothing, she is in fact a deadly covert operative working for a government agency called 'Section 9'.  The plot in the movie revolves around The Major and the other members of Section 9 as they track down a master criminal known as 'The Puppet Master' who has been hacking into local robotics factories for unknown purposes.  Naturally there is a lot of fighting and chase scenes, and not surprisingly in a Japanese animated science fiction movie, a fight near the end with a big robot.Another not unfamiliar element in a science fiction film is the presence of cyborgs.  Unlike a lot of other films though, almost everyone in this near future has some sort of cybernetic enhancement hidden below their seemingly human appearance.  In The Major this has been taken to its furthest extreme. Almost everything in her body is artificial, even most of her brain.  And this is where 'Ghost in the Shell'  departs from being a simple action film. Because in the character of Major Motoko we have a being whose consciousness and sense of self are being being transformed by pervasive technology.  While her mechanical body has the appearance of a perfect, her eyes are the one thing that you tell can are mechanical.  Those eyes are flat and lifeless and suggest a soul that isn't quite human anymore.The best animation in the movie occurs in a scene that has almost nothing to do with the plot but is very important for the theme.  The Major is on a boat that is going through the center of the city and all around as a light rain falls everyone is going about their regular lives.  The level of detail is unlike anything you will ever see in Western animated film.At one point on the boat ride she gets startled and for a brief instance we see what she is looking at. Slow it down on your VCR or DVD player and get a good look.  I won't tell you what I think it means. I will say that is nice to have a touch or too like this that the creators didn't feel a need to spoon feed to their audience. Another interesting thing to watch for is the silhouette of a helicopter after the battle with the big robot.James Cameron, creator of box office smash Titanic, has an enthusiastic blurb on the front the jacket for the DVD and you can see the influence of this work in his 'Dark Angel' TV Series.

Her novels, be they on witches, mummies, or vampires, are captivating to the many who read them.  To those like myself who for whatever reason don't read them, they are appreciated for their usually good writing, but are just not interesting.  Interview with a Vampire shows that movies based on her books (she wrote the screenplay, so there's no question of it being true to the book) suffer for the same reason.\tBefore anything else, its important to note that the leads, Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt, give excellent performances, Pitt as the tortured vampire Louis who would rather drink the blood of rats than mortals, and Cruise as his loving-to-the-point-of-insanity companion Lestat, who cares about nothing, it seems, except Louis.  Though I never had any doubt about Pitt's acting abilities, this was the first good Cruise movie I've ever seen, though he's still a bit out there, even for his character (I didn't even recognize him the first time I saw the film).  The best performance comes from neither of those two though, but a young Kirsten Dunst as the young vampire Claudia, devious, spoiled, and angry, but at the same time lonely and confused.  Her precocious acting ability is amazing, and its a shame she has been in only a couple movies since where she gets an opportunity to challenge herself and give such a good performance again.  The characters are definitely not the problem with the story, as they are interesting characters to observe, particularly Lestat's almost homo-erotic dialogue in regards to his feelings for Louis and Claudia's questions and childish angry response to seeing a nude young woman and the developed body she will never have.\tUnfortunately, the plot is simply not as compelling as its characters.  It spans multiple eras, and accurately depicts those eras, however characters change and it never adequately explains when or why.  For example, about 30 years after the creation of Claudia, Louis scoffs and jokes about how he used to drink the blood of rats instead of people.  It never explains when or if there was a specific incident relating to Louis' sudden change in attitude, though all of the movie up to that point explicitly detailed how he didn't want to take human life.  Whether these plot holes are a fault of the original book or just the movie I don't know, but they were distracting enough to prevent me from really getting into the plot.  Calling it a plot might even be a bit of a stretch; similar to last year's blockbuster Lord of the Rings Fellowship of the Ring (which I also disliked for this reason), it seems more like hours of character development than an actual coherent storyline.\tThis is really a shame because, in all other aspects, the movie is REALLY well-done.  The atmosphere is terrific, and as mentioned earlier, the differences in eras are accurately depicted.  Gothic undertones prevail every setting, as locations are dark, but mysterious instead of horrifying.  The score fits this mood perfectly, and there is some excellent cinematography and direction, such as the best scene in the movie, a performance of a group of stage-vampires (who of course are real vampires) that kidnap, strip, and drink the blood of a young woman as part of their totally unrealistic (does anyone really believe such an act, which would be controversial and probably banned today, could have taken place in 19th century Paris?) but eerily beautiful choreographed theatre act.\tInterview with a Vampire is not a bad movie, its just not very compelling.

For example, about 30 years after the creation of Claudia, Louis scoffs and jokes about how he used to drink the blood of rats instead of people.  It never explains when or if there was a specific incident relating to Louis' sudden change in attitude, though all of the movie up to that point explicitly detailed how he didn't want to take human life.  Whether these plot holes are a fault of the original book or just the movie I don't know, but they were distracting enough to prevent me from really getting into the plot.  Calling it a plot might even be a bit of a stretch; similar to last year's blockbuster Lord of the Rings Fellowship of the Ring (which I also disliked for this reason), it seems more like hours of character development than an actual coherent storyline.\tThis is really a shame because, in all other aspects, the movie is REALLY well-done.  The atmosphere is terrific, and as mentioned earlier, the differences in eras are accurately depicted.  Gothic undertones prevail every setting, as locations are dark, but mysterious instead of horrifying.  The score fits this mood perfectly, and there is some excellent cinematography and direction, such as the best scene in the movie, a performance of a group of stage-vampires (who of course are real vampires) that kidnap, strip, and drink the blood of a young woman as part of their totally unrealistic (does anyone really believe such an act, which would be controversial and probably banned today, could have taken place in 19th century Paris?) but eerily beautiful choreographed theatre act.\tInterview with a Vampire is not a bad movie, its just not very compelling.  While its a beautiful thing to watch once, there's nothing that really grabs a viewer (aside from the vampire theatre performance and Kirsten Dunst) enough to make it a truly great and enduring film.

To me it is anyway. When I was a kid, I never really was into movies. All I watched were Disney's, and my mom wouldn't let me watch action movies anyway, cos 'violence is bad for you'. All this, and everything else, changed, when, on my 8th or 9th birthday, I got the tape of Robin Hood Prince of Thieves.As I said, I had never watched a movie with even the slightest of action (or it had to be the fight with the bear in 'The Fox and the Hound'). Imagine what happened when I suddenly saw some guy's hand get chopped off, or big fight scenes and men getting hung... It was without the doubt the greatest thing I had ever seen!!I lived close to elementary school at the time, and from the day I got the tape, till about exactly one year later, I watched Robin Hood every day, right out of school. That's right EVERY day... for a year or so... Henceforth, I have seen this movie about 400 times, no kidding.Today, I put the movie on at the videostore where I work (Robin Hood really was the starting point of my film loving life - I'm an aspiring director, studying film). And even though my taste in movies has drastically evolved from that point, I still can't do anything but utterly love this film. Michael Kamen's music is fantastic, his best work ever; the cast is amazing, in particular Morgan Freeman and of course the brilliant Alan Rickman as the greatest villain in movie history (as a role I mean, it even tops his own Hans Gruber, though Darth will always be the no. 1 baddie).But don't make the mistake of counting out Kevin Costner. Yes the American accent is kinda strange, but why whine about it? He seems kinda wooden at first, but actually his acting is quite subtle, at least it fits the character great. Look at the scene where he tries to shoot an arrow with Mary Elizabeth blowing softly in his ear; he acts that beautifully. Further more, the action scenes are ace, especially the destruction of the village by the Celts, and the end sequence, with the incredible shot of Costner\/Hood shooting a lit arrow; also the shot on the poster, the 1st film poster I ever owned...Last but not least we have great lines, great side characters (Little John, the witch, Connery as King Richard, the blind servant), great direction by Reynolds, also often overlooked, and yes.. I also love THAT song (which by the way, was also the longest running no. 1 hit ever here in The Netherlands, until some punk named Borsato kicked it off the top spot..).All in all, I feel Robin Hood Prince of Thieves is one of the best examples of how to make a blockbuster these days, it's still one of the most entertaining movies I've ever seen... Of course, and I do realize this, I'm a little biased...Oh, and in case you were wondering, on my following birthday I recieved a new video, my 2nd, which I was ready to devour just like I did Robin Hood.

The film eventually exceeded my expectations and managed to impress me on many a level and proved to be at the top of it's genre ? and immensely entertaining to watch.Now don't get me wrong ? Resident Evil still wants to be a splatter movie and provides everything that is expected The group of good guys getting smaller and smaller, torn apart Zombies and other nasty creatures, blood and gore, shock effects that will have a good part of the audience jumping (and some screaming) in their seats, the girl (in this case the main heroine)not dressed in much, bullets flying left, right and centre.But this film has much more to offer than thatThe directing by Paul Anderson is quite impressive. The choreography of the plenty of action scenes not only lets you keep a sense of what's going on (as opposed to the let's-just-use-a-shaking-hand-held-camera-and-give-the-audience-a-headache kind of film) but is also nice to watch. (Sometimes also when you don't see the critical second on-screen. But don't worry, you will still see plenty!) Sets and effects create  the creepy and claustrophobic atmosphere, with the undead dogs being my favourite bad creatures ? they do the best job in looking disgusting yet dangerous.The Story, by Anderson too, is also a major point that raises this flick above the average standard of the genre. Sure, the whole design of the hive, the super-computer, the virus etc. lack any real-life logic, but this is hardly what you came looking for in a film about zombie-bashing in the first place. So once you're in the right frame of mind to accept that, the story in itself is quite complex for it's genre. There are a couple of sub-plots, flashback scenes, deadlines and plot twists, so to successfully add suspense and surprise moments to all the shock and fright scenes. The film avoids using all typical cliché-scenes, never getting totally predictable and boring. A couple characters also have there individual background and escape the trap of becoming two-dimensional monster food. You even begin to care about them, especially the Soldier played by Michelle Rodriguez. The actors are convincing and do a very decent job. Note that even for smaller roles, Resident Evil casted real actors instead of zombie food extras.

The story then jumps ahead  and leaves the audience with a there-at-this-point-all-of-sudden?-that-was-fast! feeling. I wonder if there'll be a directors cut on DVD. The music in the first part of the film is a bit too loud and disturbing. Nothing is really going on yet, but we already have the sound that would be worthy for a showdown scene. It gets better after a while (maybe because the action starts fitting the music). With all the positive points though, the later ones can easily be overlooked.All in all, if you like the Zombie-slaying kind of horror film, go see Resident Evil ? it's a prime quality example of this genre and you won't be disappointed.P.S.

Maybe that's what Bluth intended because he knew that every aspect of Thumbelina is totally horrid and only worthwhile as material for creative IMDB users who want to shoot it down. The only good part of this movie is when John Hurt shows up as this mole who's so desperate for a spouse that he's actually considering Thumbelina. Always noble, perhaps the greatest humanitarian of our time.. Who but John Hurt would try to assist this wretched film that is a 76-minute result of whatever extraterrestrial brain-sucking creature got a grip on Don Bluth's head in 1990 and hasn't since let go or stopped feeding? (Though it did vomit in '97 and return to him enough sentience to produce Anastasia.)This is the WORST. (Except for possibly A Troll in Central Park, which I haven't seen.) Worse than Rock A Doodle and much worse than The Pebble and the Penguin, full of songs I could criticize if only I could remember anything about them, full of blah like the follow your heart spiel which is trite here, well after being trite in The Land Before Time, and before being trite in Nimh 2 and Cinderella 2. The plot is incomprehensible all around, following Thum as she dances around with a bunch of racially insensitive frogs and then gets involved (somehow) with a lot of insects.. I don't even remember how. Trying to call up the reasons and explanations but they just aren't coming because nothing makes sense in this movie. (Characters appear and then just leave at random.) Also it's BORING. I SO wanted to turn it off, and had to force myself to get through the whole thing without hitting the FF button.. (I knew if I touched it even once, it'd be all over.)  I can't conceive of any reason why ANYone over 2 years old would like this movie. The only cute thing in it is the fuzzy bumblebee that Cornelius rides-- nothing else is even remotely interesting or worthwhile. It is NOT good for the whole family. I highly do not recommend renting this for a family night or a solo night or any night. Oh and don't be fooled by the trailer, which is highly deceptive as it includes the only really coherent sequence in the whole thing, the part where Thum and Cornelius first meet.For more intelligent fare, rent any of the Teletubbie adventures and be awestruck by their sophistication.

Also if you plan on seeing the film then this would detract from the experience.)I am 100% in agreement with the Academy on this one. Smith's actual acting is fine, voights inhabitation of a news presenter I know nothing about is also sturdy but the movie as a work is extremely flawed.First up the other good points though. Alot of the ring action, as film drama is gut wrenching. I don't know if that is simply because Rocky is one of very few boxing movies I have seen though. All but the Rumble in the Jungle makes you sweat, the humour where present is successful aswell; but the rest of my review is griping.Firstly, the make or break element of the movie; sadly breaks it. Smith plays undaunted arrogance (with the exception of the crowning Sonny Liston win; quite a funny moment occurs) well but he was not PLAYING Muhammed Ali. What little I know of the man is from a knowledgable elder and the Oscar winning doco When We Were Kings. You could see in much of the leadup (to the Rumble in the Jungle)in that doco that there was fear behind Ali's eyes. The man also seemed to have a semi-serious approach to much of what he said publically, he wasn't always 100% stern, there was a beautiful irony inherent, this does not come across. The casting of Smith is something I would expect to see in a spoof about Hollywood and how they popcorn everything up. Smith must have done next to no body-building for the part and it shows. Ali may not have been big for a heavyweight but he was and is certainly alot bigger (build wise) than Will Smith, I could never get past it just being Smith playing a role.None of what actually made the man a great boxer comes across, and the preparation subterfuge for the Rumble in the Jungle is ultimately removed, robbing the films climax of tension. It is, not too pointedly, spoken of in the doco that Ali spent sparring sessions preparing for rib punches and rope-a-doping, vital to his win. And little of the pessimism about the champs return comes across. Before the fight the documentary tells us that the minutes before Ali left the changeroom felt like a last supper. His supporters thought that he was going out to an inevitable loss, it was in that room that Ali's optimism and cheer brought morale up among them which would have been PERFECT for a hollywood movie. There is none of this in the movie, Mann likes that sort of stuff ('Heat')and yet he allowed its removal.We also don't learn very much at all about Ali as a person, and as a previous reviewer said it only covers a neat decade of his life, nothing of his Gold medal fiasco is in it, which is another major part of his career and public life (his medal in the 96 Atlanta Olympics is tied in with it). We also know nothing of his childhood or what his early ambitions were, what actually MADE him, all that supposedly 'corny' stuff that most biopics can't resist including. If you want an informative and tense telling of the famous George Foreman fight watch the documentary, and there is now a DVD with all the footage of his fights and interviews you could want.See this or don't see it, that quite honestly is good advice. Smith fans or fans of actors in general should find it a good troubleshoot experience. Three hours should never feel this shortcoming.7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"10 March 2002","score":"","review":"  (IF YOU DO NOT KNOW ABOUT THE 'RUMBLE IN THE JUNGLE' PORTION OF MUHAMMED'S LIFE AND HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE THEN CONSIDER THIS A SPOILER WARNING.

Alot of the ring action, as film drama is gut wrenching. I don't know if that is simply because Rocky is one of very few boxing movies I have seen though. All but the Rumble in the Jungle makes you sweat, the humour where present is successful aswell; but the rest of my review is griping.Firstly, the make or break element of the movie; sadly breaks it. Smith plays undaunted arrogance (with the exception of the crowning Sonny Liston win; quite a funny moment occurs) well but he was not PLAYING Muhammed Ali. What little I know of the man is from a knowledgable elder and the Oscar winning doco When We Were Kings. You could see in much of the leadup (to the Rumble in the Jungle)in that doco that there was fear behind Ali's eyes. The man also seemed to have a semi-serious approach to much of what he said publically, he wasn't always 100% stern, there was a beautiful irony inherent, this does not come across. The casting of Smith is something I would expect to see in a spoof about Hollywood and how they popcorn everything up. Smith must have done next to no body-building for the part and it shows. Ali may not have been big for a heavyweight but he was and is certainly alot bigger (build wise) than Will Smith, I could never get past it just being Smith playing a role.None of what actually made the man a great boxer comes across, and the preparation subterfuge for the Rumble in the Jungle is ultimately removed, robbing the films climax of tension. It is, not too pointedly, spoken of in the doco that Ali spent sparring sessions preparing for rib punches and rope-a-doping, vital to his win. And little of the pessimism about the champs return comes across. Before the fight the documentary tells us that the minutes before Ali left the changeroom felt like a last supper. His supporters thought that he was going out to an inevitable loss, it was in that room that Ali's optimism and cheer brought morale up among them which would have been PERFECT for a hollywood movie. There is none of this in the movie, Mann likes that sort of stuff ('Heat')and yet he allowed its removal.We also don't learn very much at all about Ali as a person, and as a previous reviewer said it only covers a neat decade of his life, nothing of his Gold medal fiasco is in it, which is another major part of his career and public life (his medal in the 96 Atlanta Olympics is tied in with it). We also know nothing of his childhood or what his early ambitions were, what actually MADE him, all that supposedly 'corny' stuff that most biopics can't resist including. If you want an informative and tense telling of the famous George Foreman fight watch the documentary, and there is now a DVD with all the footage of his fights and interviews you could want.See this or don't see it, that quite honestly is good advice. Smith fans or fans of actors in general should find it a good troubleshoot experience. Three hours should never feel this shortcoming.7\/10 ","genre":"Biography, Drama, Sport"},{"date":"10 March 2002","score":"","review":"  (IF YOU DO NOT KNOW ABOUT THE 'RUMBLE IN THE JUNGLE' PORTION OF MUHAMMED'S LIFE AND HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE THEN CONSIDER THIS A SPOILER WARNING.

The BBC's radio production was the only other medium that I thought got close to the book, and even it felt short ultimately. So this new version was a scary thing to consider.I approached it with dread and left the theater in a state of joyous, celebratory relief. It was right! They did it right. It wasn't cutesy or fey. It wasn't all D&D monsters mightier than thou. Gandalf twinkled and roared. Sam was nervous and loyal. Frodo was scared and grimly determined. Merry and Pippin were perfect friends, excellent foils. Legolas and Gimli were believeable. The hobbits looked like hobbits, not children in grownup clothing.The characters looked like they knew what they were doing with swords and bows and axes, and they all eventually looked liked they'd been far too many days on the road.It's the little things that make a film, for me. The right details, the unmentioned background touches, like the statues behind the main characters in one forest scene (a treat for readers of the books) and the design on Boromir's bracers.And no, I'm not forgetting Boromir or Aragorn. As the two least magical characters in the group, they could easily have been overshadowed by elves, dwarves, wizards and the lot. But they gave a good accounting for we mere humans - limited, tormented, but strong, firm, and ultimately capable of doing the right thing, no matter how hard.This is an incredibly good adaptation of Tolkien's astonishingly wonderful story. The movie, like the book, gives me hope for the human race.And it's a darned good rip-snorting action adventure, to boot.See it. Then see it again, to appreciate Peter Jackson and his amazing crews' work on the details.
