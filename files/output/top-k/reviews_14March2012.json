As they were all looking into a man called Kananga, the Prime Minister of the Caribbean nation of San Monique he first heads to New York where Kananga had been addressing the UN. He hasn't been there long when an attempt is made on his life. It isn't long before he comes to the attention of local crime lord 'Mr Big'. By the time he is free again Katanga is back in the Caribbean along with his fortune-teller Solitaire. Bond follows them there and after an encounter with a snake he heads to find out what Katanga is up to. Bond being Bond he has to pay Solitaire a visit too. After a night with Bond she is keen to leave Kananga and they discover the truth about his activities; he is going a huge quantity of heroin with which he plans to take over the US drugs market. Once off the island the head for New Orleans where Bond will have to survive a crocodile attack and a spectacular boat change before heading back to San Monique to confront Kananga one last time.This was a fine introduction to the 'new Bond' Roger Moore is very different to Sean Connery and George Lazenby but still makes a fine bond. The role is quite a bit lighter now with far more quips and light hearted moments. More humour is provided by Clifton James who plays the stereotypical southern Sheriff; he is a character viewers will find very funny or very annoying; thankfully I thought he was funny. The villain Kananga was played by Yaphet Kotto who did a great job and certainly wasn't playing for laughs. Jane Seymour proves to be a fine Bond Girl in the role of Solitaire; a character as mysterious as she is attractive. The story might not be about somebody trying to take over the world but it was still exciting and had some of the best action scenes yet; I can't think of any other film that has a better boat chase scene. I suspect most Bond fans will really enjoy this even those who are still missing Connery.

You don't always need to be precise with the costumes and sets in that period of time, which actually would have taken away from this story, the story of Jesus(in this film). This film basically delineates the key events of Jesus Christ, as the bible has it, but it adds things that may or may not have happened during Jesus' time. Most of this film is Jesus' doubt within himself and how he is God in his heart-on the inside, and how he is human-on the outside.In this movie,Jesus talks about how he must die on the cross in order to bring man and God together, to bring man into salvation. In the bible, Jesus was tempted, and he did throw things when he saw how the people were desecrating his father's temple, that part of the movie is true, according to the bible. But 'What is Truth' as Pontius Pilate said, a quote I've referred to many times. Each persons truth and\/or opinion is different. What is the right way, who got it right? Christianity? Buddhism? L. Ron Hubbard? It just comes down to 'What is truth?' to the individual. If you live a happy life being a Christian, then that's right for you, if you live a happy life being a Scientologist, Buddhist, a Hindu, then that's right for you. There's always going to be arguments until our end of days about Everything and Anything. Eckart Tolle once talked about how most people that argue(one person arguing with another person), most of the time both people are correct in some way. He said we as humans hate to come to terms with that(that the other guy is correct too) and I agree with him on that. We as humans want everything to be right or wrong, black or white and if both people are right in an argument, then that's a real mind freak to us, we like it to be one way right, or one way wrong, but that's really never the case. And the other mind trip is that if one person is very ignorant and the other person isn't and\/or they're well educated in what they are arguing about, still most of the time, both persons will be correct in an argument. Of course there's levels of what is sensible and what isn't, but in the end, both people are usually right in some way unless it's something to the likes of a story Eckart Tolle once told, he said, 'If I had an apple in my hand, I would know it to be an apple. If the Buddha came up to me and told me that it wasn't an apple, I would say 'Well I guess even the Buddha gets it wrong sometimes', I would know it to be an apple.' In those kinds of scenarios yes, someone is right and someone is insensibly wrong.So the same applies with this movie, there's no black or white, it's all gray. Jesus is tempted, a lot more here then he is in the bible. In this film he knew Mary Magdalene as a child, then he grows up, and goes into her Place and watches her have sex with men all day. Jesus loves Mary and he has to suffer watching her with all these men, and then not give into the temptation of sleeping with her. Extreme suffering already. Here Jesus doesn't want to die on the cross, he asks his father, himself in so many terms 'is there another way?' Jesus gets tempted by Satan to the very end with a 'It's a Wonderful Life Sequence' that is brilliantly thrown into the mix of this movie. Judas doesn't want to betray Jesus in this movie, but Jesus asks him too, so Judas does because he loves Jesus so much. Willem Dafoe as Jesus Christ? From what we know of Jesus, from the bible, from that time period, from stereotypes, Willem Dafoe is very miscast as Jesus, initially, just like initially you see Harvey Keitel as Judas, and think the same thing, but once you get over that initial stereotype, you see Dafoe as Jesus because he is so good at bringing the part to life. Excellent performances by Dafoe and Keitel. Again, it's all about the struggle from within, and the things that tempt us. Everything tempts us, uncertainty is what we always feel in life, just like the uncertainty Jesus felt in this film. In this film, Jesus' God self inside is constantly butting heads with his human self on the outside, bringing about so much confusion and uncertainty within himself, The Last Temptation of Christ is more a conflict of Person Vs. Person, or should I say Jesus Vs. Jesus. But Jesus knew himself by the end of this film. It was a struggle, and it was a powerful journey. Experience it for yourself, watch this film!

It reflects the colossal effort, light on nothing short of a godlike scale. Hitler's architect was one of many who collaborated to achieve a spectacle designed to be history, a record that created reality, including Riefenstahl and Hitler himself. This is what is ultimately so frightening about this, before we get of course to the horrors of war and genocide, eerily foreshadowed in the Nuremberg display of state power, the thing - Nazism on the level of show business - was already being manufactured at this point, and as an image.This is enough to give us pause, the construction of an entire cosmology, on the abstract level, that would soon create an actual world from it.Nazi politics are slim, in the film and I presume in the actual rally itself, that is if we ever accept they were any deep to begin with. Sloganeering is the whole point. Fuhrerprinzip, a Great Germany, expansionism, and only a passing comment on racial purity - antisemitism toned down for broader appeal.No what is really political about this, in several ways, is the image itself. Of course a show about a show being staged, the entire event specifically prepared to be the film about it. More importantly, a show and film that would not have been possible on this scale and fervor, if the collective heart of a people, including those filming it and the thousands in rapturous attendance, had not so firmly desired it.

Normally the intro of these kind of films always say this film is based on real events What is said here? This is a fictional movie based on real events Why? why is it necessary to say this by this particular movie? This movie shows it all. That priest are also just human and that it's almost impossible to fight against your own hormones which do make sex one of the first necessities of life and that it's very unhealthy to repress it till it simply bursts out. Not every priest who has molested children has been molested in his own youth.Therefore it is necessary to show this amount of child nudity. I almost threw up and wanted to jump at the TV at the abusive scene of Brother Lavin and Kevin. It makes you feel nauseated and this is exactly what you should feel and makes this movie so impressive. Children become products of the way they are raised and that is brilliantly shown in this movie.For me this movie should be a must see for everybody. Feel the nauseousness, be absolutely disgusted by it. It is necessary to let it sink in that even religious institutions certainly aren't as holy as they are appearing to be ","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"14 March 2012","score":"0 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" From director Peter Weir (Gallipoli, Witness, Dead Poets Society, The Truman Show), I expected this to be some kind of Cast Away or Swiss Family Robinson style desert island film, I watched it because of the three good leading stars. Basically Allie Fox (Harrison Ford) is the eccentric and arrogant inventor who doesn't do things by the book, and his troubled genius, intense moods and incredible drive have given the idea, apparently on a sudden whim, to make a new somewhere else. So with his family, Mother Fox (Dame Helen Mirren), teenage son Charlie (River Phoenix), younger son Jerry (Jadrien Steele) and young twins April and clover (twins Hilary and Rebecca Gordon), they travel to the jungles of Central America to live their new life. Over time, in the middle of the jungle, a new factory is built, and the experiment to create large ice cubes to sell to the local people and all over is successful. There are problems with their new environment though, not just from the inquisitive and sometimes vicious tribes people, from Christian missionary Reverend Spellgood (Andre Gregory) who has a strong hatred for Communists, but mostly from Allie. His attitude, strong attitudes and short fuse make him a bad father, a poor husband, and more than anything a hateful control freak and he wants things done his way and has almost no care for anything or anyone else. It comes to the point when Allie really goes over the edge and too far in his self brewing madness, he destroys the ice factory because of severe paranoia, and the family know that they have to leave. In the end, the only way Allie is finally put to rest and his terrible ways stopped is to be shot and paralysed, Mother upset, but the family do finally leave the jungle and the final narration by Charlie says he did die, but the family go on with hope.

I just discovered it in 2012 but after 12 years it's still like nothing else. It's been compared to other so-called drug movies like Trainspotting, which makes some sense but ultimately is unfair. Compared to this, Trainspotting is a comedy. This movie is a drama in every way.I won't go into the plot because I don't wan't to spoil anything and let's face it, reading about it 12 years later? You know what it's about. What I will say is that this movie is not for everyone and that it bends the rules of what we can call entertainment. It's not fun or entertaining like most movies or even documentaries are but it's interesting nonetheless. A lot of negative criticism towards this movie seems to come from the fact that a lot of people actually will not want to see it. Not because it's bad but because it's probably too realistic to be comfortable.So it's good and not mainstream (yet). Looks like we've got a cult classic, no? Well, yes and no. Yes because it should be considered a classic and no because it's not glamorizing anything. Trainspotting, for all its intents and purposes, is great and gritty but also funny as hell. This movie isn't. It starts pretty boring like most movies and ends with drama but nothing is funny, save one or two lines of text. That leaves little to glamorize and limits its cult appeal in a lot of circles.What this movie does do, and what is sets apart from most movies, is simplicity. It shows four people and their drug addictions. You don't get to know and love them before they get addicted and you don't get to know every detail about why they do what they do. They're pretty normal people with normal dreams and lives. The movie explains more details about some characters than others but you don't get to know a lot about them and you don't need to. You'll see their lives fall apart and you'll feel bad for them. Not because you love them but because of the way things are shown.And that's the beauty of this movie. Even though most of the actual drug intake isn't shown, the effects become clearer by the minute. All of the results of the character's actions are shown, and they're not pretty. Sex, violence, family issues and racism are themes that are all there and don't leave much to the imagination. There are a lot of subtle moral issues as well, which gives the movie even more depth.The only complaint I have about this movie is about one scene. You'll have to make it through but it's absolutely out of place. Some of the characters experience psychoses during the movie. Not much of a problem except that one of them looks like it's taken straight out of an 80's horror movie. You can place it into context but it's a bit too much.

I have reluctantly revisited it recently. It took me several viewings to fully appreciate it, and it's probably the greatest movie ever made. Much has been said about this film, and usually people who have something to criticize are getting into pissing contests over its historical accuracy. I couldn't care less about those controversies, they are missing the point. This is a fictionalized account, not a history lesson. I'm only interested in Peter O'Toole's Lawrence and the way this particular story is told. Historically accurate or not, I don't care. Not only Lawrence of Arabia hasn't aged one day, but it's light years ahead of recent productions. Cinematic perfection is what it is, and it's a miracle. There must have been a rare star alignment 50 years ago, that made everything click so perfectly - cast, acting, script, music, editing, scenery, costumes, all within a remarkable direction. Every scene is an invaluable lesson of filmmaking, a demonstration of superlative acting. What strikes me is that sensitive issues like sexual identity and violence are beautifully explored with a subtlety, intelligence and elegance that are no longer to be found in film today. I'm afraid to imagine how the Deraa sequence would be depicted these days. Filmmakers today just lack the talent and sensitivity to make it compelling without resorting to obscenity and gore for cheap shock value. Peter O'Toole is splendid, sophisticated,larger-than-life, and leaves you breathless with every movement. You will notice the subtle touches of his performance, the nuances of his ambiguous identity, constantly shifting. The portrayal of Lawrence is somewhat inconsistent, inexplicit, and he remains a fascinating puzzle, which is both frustrating and also the key to the movie's overall success. You will be blown away by the power of Lean's imagery and his ability to define a character so precisely and memorably through purely visual means. There's no CGI, so everything looks and feels real. But it feels real mostly because we see the alien Arab world through Lawrence's eyes. It's amazing how introspective, how personal such a grand-scale epic can be. So who is O'Toole's Lawrence? What is it that drives him to do what he does? I still don't know, but with each viewing there's something new to discover. I believe that David Lean's respect for the mystery, for the ineffable of human personality is something to be admired.

Unlike Leone, once the torpedos are launched and the depth charges dropped, the cat-and-mouse game is ongoing and relentless, but never boring.And despite the fact that most of the film takes place inside a cramped submarine, Das Boot is never boring to look at; in fact, it's a visually spectacular film (given the dated special effects, who hold up reasonably well and add to the old-school charm). And the freedom of the camera in those tight corridors came as an incredibly pleasant surprise. The color and composition of the shots in those tight quarters -- particularly upon approaching the first destroyer when we get the first real glimpse of the interior prepped for war -- it is both haunting and beautiful.Jurgen Prochnow delivers the most believable performance of a ship captain I've ever seen on film. All the emotions register on his face--his concern for his own life, ship, and crew; his hatred for the decisions he's forced to make; the disbelieving joy of beating the overwhelming odds--while simultaneously holding it back so the crew sees a strong unmoving man forever in control of the situation. His performance is, in a word, brilliant.The rest of the cast also delivers amazingly believable performances, and trust me, I could write an entire review on the film's characters and their portrayals. It's both disappointing and satisfying that I'm not given enough space to do so (I wish I could state that about a tenth of the films I've reviewed here on IMDb.) I liked the entire crew of this U-boat, the war correspondent and his character arc as he realizes the truth behind these heroes, the chief and his longing to return to his wife, Johann and the story of his redemption--all well cast, well acted, and believable.Another aspect I adored about Das Boot - the controversial scenes simply rolled by with no more or less emphasis than any other statement the film makes. In fact, I saw the film before really reading anything or researching it and found myself somewhat shocked to hear about these talked about scenes. Granted, the film does pose some moral questions, but I felt the film handled it with grace and great subtlety, showing what it needs to get the point across and not a step further . . . unlike typical Hollywood where controversy gets bold print, italics, and a highlighter. Maybe I should move to Germany.

And the freedom of the camera in those tight corridors came as an incredibly pleasant surprise. The color and composition of the shots in those tight quarters -- particularly upon approaching the first destroyer when we get the first real glimpse of the interior prepped for war -- it is both haunting and beautiful.Jurgen Prochnow delivers the most believable performance of a ship captain I've ever seen on film. All the emotions register on his face--his concern for his own life, ship, and crew; his hatred for the decisions he's forced to make; the disbelieving joy of beating the overwhelming odds--while simultaneously holding it back so the crew sees a strong unmoving man forever in control of the situation. His performance is, in a word, brilliant.The rest of the cast also delivers amazingly believable performances, and trust me, I could write an entire review on the film's characters and their portrayals. It's both disappointing and satisfying that I'm not given enough space to do so (I wish I could state that about a tenth of the films I've reviewed here on IMDb.) I liked the entire crew of this U-boat, the war correspondent and his character arc as he realizes the truth behind these heroes, the chief and his longing to return to his wife, Johann and the story of his redemption--all well cast, well acted, and believable.Another aspect I adored about Das Boot - the controversial scenes simply rolled by with no more or less emphasis than any other statement the film makes. In fact, I saw the film before really reading anything or researching it and found myself somewhat shocked to hear about these talked about scenes. Granted, the film does pose some moral questions, but I felt the film handled it with grace and great subtlety, showing what it needs to get the point across and not a step further . . . unlike typical Hollywood where controversy gets bold print, italics, and a highlighter. Maybe I should move to Germany.

I agree with one critic only when he states that the film presents meaningless issues in an intensely-fascinating and almost lyrical fashion, and I would like to put a big emphasis on MEANINGLESS!!! How can something meaningless be good?Another famous critic, Roger Ebert, claims Seeing this movie last May at the Cannes Film Festival, I knew it was either one of the year's best films, or one of the worst. Tarantino is too gifted a filmmaker to make a boring movie, but he could possibly make a bad one... That is amazing! One of the world's most acclaimed film critics watches a 'masterpiece', and right after that cannot decide whether it is really a masterpiece or garbage? Then he goes on to say, 'oh, but it can't be garbage if such an in-director made it, so it must be a masterpiece'. So much for competent individual judgment... I suppose you would not be able to call yourself a critic if you wrote that Tarantino simply screwed up this time...In my opinion, the film has a ton of famous actors, an in director, and nothing else. The plot is practically non-existent, there is no message, no higher meaning, nothing but violence for the sake of violence..., and above all, it does not entertain either!

But still there's a stigma attached to his family name. So, Maverick always tries to endeavor very hard when he flies.Top Gun is a film about emotion, passion and most importantly ego of Maverick. Top Gun shows all the flavors of emotions. It shows desperation of Maverick not to be second. Maverick has only one friend Goose. Goose is his family. Nobody likes Maverick, but Goose. Maverick doesn't want to risk Goose's job, by doing some unnecessary stints in the sky, but his desperation and ego to be better than others due what happened to his father, never listens to him.Tom Cruise pulls off performance of his life in this movie.

But Edward Norton's turn as the defendant\/victim in Primal Fear is one of those Wow moments that leaves the audience salivating for his next performance. In this feature debut, Norton outdistances his role, as does Richard Gere, in a resurrection no less impressive than Norton's star-making turn. Heretofore, Gere has specialized in assorted intelligent professional cad roles. Here, he gets a chance to inhabit one that not only wears his dubious character on his sleeve, but wears it, drives it, drinks it... revels in it. Yeah, sure somewhere there's a heart of gold, but like his client, the layers on top serve him better, and the heart of gold is tarnished. Gere is at his peak, comfortably, cheerfully inhabiting the role.Laura Linney deserves extra credit for often being the ice-queen foil which propels the two male characters' development; her own character is rather one- dimensional, but she herself squeezes as much dazzle as she can from it. Even though everyone else obviously falls for whatever Gere's Vail purrs into their ears, it's merely enough time for Linney's Janet to get a drag on her ubiquitous cigarette; another step in what will (hopefully) someday be film's love affair with her.

Scaramanga is famed for charging a million dollars per hit and using solid gold bullets and when one of them it sent to M with Bond's number on it looks as if he will be the next victim.

It looks as if Scaramanga is going to succeed when he has a clear shot at Bond's back... instead another man dies; a man Bond had been searching for. The dead man was an expert on solar and it seems that Scaramanga had been working for a Chinese tycoon based in Thailand. Bond follows him there and eventually they meet up but Scaramanga escapes along with Bond's assistant Miss Goodnight and a vital piece of solar energy technology. If Bond is to retrieve it he will have to go to the island and confront Scaramanga in his 'funfair of death'.If you were hoping for something serious you will be sorely disappointed; this entry in the Bond series is probably the most far-fetched to date.
