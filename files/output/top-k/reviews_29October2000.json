[{"date":"29 October 2000","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":"  Keitel, Dafoe, and especially, Sorvino carry this film.  Those who criticize their performances as emotionless don't seem to understand that episodes of love in 'real' peoples' lives need not be filled with overt rapture.  In other words (appropriate to this film), we don't need to be re-creating Gene Kelly's 'Singing in the Rain' scene when fate brings us into those moments of untainted happiness.  The actors brought to their roles exactly what was necessary.  The film is about the unpredictable yet apparently fatalistic turns life can take.  Though we might not be able to say what is going to happen next with each passing scene, there is some method (guided by an inanimate object in this film) to the madness.  As the viewer, you sense, for better or worse, that the characters are inexorably moving toward an end, traversing both love and loss on their journey.  This film will either captivate or alienate the viewer, just rent it and see for yourself.
