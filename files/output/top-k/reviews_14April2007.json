But basically it was just a Space Opera about an All American family getting caught in a bad neighborhood, and it was obvious even to me that Irwin Allen had no feel (or respect) for a genre that I passionately adored back then. (Note I read recently that the source of the series was actually the novel Space Family Robinson. For all I know, it might have been very good, but SWISS Family Robinson was obviously the real source, along with Robinson Crusoe.) 3 decades later, I saw the movie version in the theaters, just for something to do.My reaction was basically, Eh. The acting was mostly higher level (with some major exceptions), the toys and the special effects obviously cost some money, and the screenplay acknowledged the fact that movies like Event Horizon and Outland and Star Trek II had raised the bar in the genre quite a bit...but it was painfully obvious that this was a 2nd rate movie that existed only for its McDonalds' marketing tie-ins and would die in 3 weeks or less. Which it did. 8 years later still, cable aired it again. I feel that some movies seem to improve with time after their initial viewing, once I know where the good parts are; and sometimes the small screen showcases the movie's strengths better. So I gave LS another chance. My conclusion Nope, it's still pretty much a waste of time.How did the filmmakers blow it? Let me count the ways The whole dysfunctional family thread backfired. If I understand the basic premise, Dr. Robinson is trying to save the ENTIRE HUMAN RACE with an enormously complex and hazardous expedition, and he even wants to take his family with him - in spite of all the logistical and operational problems it will cause. But all the kids and the wife can do is complain that he seems a bit preoccupied with the project that, and let me repeat this for emphasis, THE ENTIRE HUMAN RACE DEPENDS ON. That's just too much whiny 80's revisionism for what is supposed to be a great adventure story la the original Swiss Family Robinson tale that inspired it. The characters and their actions seem trivial and petty in a story where epic heroism is called for. 2nd problem Mostly the acting just doesn't gel. Matt LeBlanc is especially off here - half the time he's blandly dashing and handsome...but the other half he's Tony from Friends, and Tony is just not right for this kind of movie. The director should have beat him with a chair until he channeled the original rigid, clipped, uptight Major Don West of the TV series. The other weak spot is the boy who plays Will Robinson. He can act, but he's kind of dull. A person could argue that he's actually more naturalistic and believable as a young boy in space than Billy Mumy, but this is not a movie where a naturalistic performance is needed. The kid just isn't interesting in the part, and since the last third of the movie revolves around the struggle between Dr's. Robinson and Smith for the heart and soul of his character, the whole thing becomes kind of moot. (BTW, a lot of people complained about how annoying Lacey Chabert was in her part, but I blame the screenplay and the director for this - the character was written to be irritating and snarky, and she gave the performance that the role called for. You can point fingers and lay blame at a lot of people for the failure of the movie, but she isn't one of the problems. I actually kind of liked her.) Even where the actors are doing a good job, they are forced them to emote lines that fall flat. Poor Gary Oldman gets a lot of clinkers (Evil recognizes evil? Geez, c'mon...!) LeBlanc and Graham are also forced to spout some really wooden and contrived dialog in their, um, romantic scenes and by-play that they can't pull off; it doesn't help that they have no discernible chemistry. They don't even appear to like each other very much. And Mimi Rogers is given very little to do but bitch at her husband as if she were a soccer mom instead of a PhD carrying astronaut. Even with all these problems, the first part of the movie has its moments; there's some decent action, some impressive special effects, some intrigue and suspense. The climax in the first act when the ship does an emergency jump into hyperspace to avoid disaster is actually the best part of the movie; there's a memorable 30 second bit of silence and freeze frame that somehow shows the extreme peril of the situation and the humanity of the characters. But after that, it's all downhill as the plot becomes convoluted and tragic and depressing. I remember that the ending left room for a sequel, but it just didn't seem worth following up. So there you have it A classic family adventure story dumbed down into campy source material, then bumped back up with major stars and budget, then dumbed back down with misjudged performances and stupid dialog and plotting. There's enough about it to like that I can't give it less than 5 stars, but this is a DVD I wouldn't keep in my collection even if someone gave it to me for free. Too bad.

But I was wrong.This movies holds a great many resemblances with The Notebook. Most probably because they are both based on novels written by Nicholas Sparks. A man who, in his life, clearly has experienced true love to be able to write about it so beautifully. If you have ever tasted true love, you will feel it during this picture. You will see the sparks between Jamie and Landon, because just like between Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling in the Notebook, the chemistry between Mandy Moore and Shane West is heartbreakingly real. This is without a doubt Moore's best movie and one of West's best performance.This movie is all about true love, and its power. A power so strong, that it can change you inside forever, change your life forever. Shane West portrays that very well, and Mandy Moore truly delivers an enchanting performance. You see it, and you believe it. Those who reproached The Notebook to be too long will definitely find A Walk to Remember better as it is significantly shorter. The essence though, remains intact. It would be hard to believe this picture will not bring tears to your eyes. At the very least, it will touch you, for sure. Just like after I finished watching The Notebook, I couldn't stop feeling serenity and warmth. Something so beautiful is truly rare, and anyone who will ever taste this will be lucky. This is what you understand from all of this, and the message is well and clearly delivered without the need of sex or nudity, which is a pretty rare thing NOT to see nowadays.Of course, it isn't perfect. Thankfully the usual they lived happily ever after cliché is non-existent here, and it wasn't the point. Some might find it too romantic, too unrealistic, cheesy even. As I said, those who have tasted this kind of love will see it this movie from a different angle. The score doesn't compare to Hans Zimmer's work (or The Notebook's for that matter), but it good, appropriate, and Mandy Moore's gentle voice can be heard a few times in the movie.I am very happy I gave the movie its chance. I shed quite a few tears, and wished the movie would not yet end.

I had always thought it would be one of the usual flick, teen-like and full of clichés. The sort of movie you regret having paid for, that will only touch the superficials. But I was wrong.This movies holds a great many resemblances with The Notebook. Most probably because they are both based on novels written by Nicholas Sparks. A man who, in his life, clearly has experienced true love to be able to write about it so beautifully. If you have ever tasted true love, you will feel it during this picture. You will see the sparks between Jamie and Landon, because just like between Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling in the Notebook, the chemistry between Mandy Moore and Shane West is heartbreakingly real. This is without a doubt Moore's best movie and one of West's best performance.This movie is all about true love, and its power. A power so strong, that it can change you inside forever, change your life forever. Shane West portrays that very well, and Mandy Moore truly delivers an enchanting performance. You see it, and you believe it. Those who reproached The Notebook to be too long will definitely find A Walk to Remember better as it is significantly shorter. The essence though, remains intact. It would be hard to believe this picture will not bring tears to your eyes. At the very least, it will touch you, for sure. Just like after I finished watching The Notebook, I couldn't stop feeling serenity and warmth. Something so beautiful is truly rare, and anyone who will ever taste this will be lucky. This is what you understand from all of this, and the message is well and clearly delivered without the need of sex or nudity, which is a pretty rare thing NOT to see nowadays.Of course, it isn't perfect. Thankfully the usual they lived happily ever after cliché is non-existent here, and it wasn't the point. Some might find it too romantic, too unrealistic, cheesy even. As I said, those who have tasted this kind of love will see it this movie from a different angle. The score doesn't compare to Hans Zimmer's work (or The Notebook's for that matter), but it good, appropriate, and Mandy Moore's gentle voice can be heard a few times in the movie.I am very happy I gave the movie its chance. I shed quite a few tears, and wished the movie would not yet end. Although the level of complexity of The Notebook isn't present in A Walk to Remember, it touched me more, and it definitely stands in the league with The Green Mile of the biggest tear jerkers.All-in-all a great movie the romantic will purely and truly enjoy. If anything, a picture that will touch anyone who makes the effort to watch it with an open-mind, that such love exists. 8\/10 ","genre":"Drama, Romance"},{"date":"14 April 2007","score":"","review":" Torrance had been made the new cheerleading captain of the Torros.

Innocent people die frequently in lower income neighborhoods from stray bullets that are from gang activity. It would have made some sense for us to see more police in the movie. But I guess that would take away from the plot. Plot?....A loser white guy is called on to help the inner-city black kids in South Chicago's projects? I guess Hollywood believes there's incredible funding for the children in America's ghettos. OK Reeves, get to work dude, like, these kids in da hood are like, counting on you. Now Ms Lane is still insanely pretty, but her placement in the movie is hard to believe. That's not to say that there are no white people working with black kids in the inner-city, but think about it. I've worked in an inner-city school in California and just helping the kids during the school day was a challenge. For outside of school activities, ridiculous amounts of preparation had to be worked on. Now, maybe Chicago doesn't have as many communication problems that California does with non-English speaking parents, but just being able to talk with parents who speak English takes time and often doesn't go well. Try getting the older daughter, with a mother who works three jobs, to set up a time, for the teacher, or coach in this case, to talk with the mother about her 11 year old son's need to start paying attention. This movie doesn't even go near subjects like that. I not too put off by Keanu's acting ability in this movie, though I still think he's a one-trick pony, and there were no tricks in this script for him to do. He still seems likable. But, a white guy who's a ticket scalping, gambling loser coaching a little league team of poor black kids in the projects....??? I guess Hollywood still thinks that the lives of poor black kids in the inner-cities can only be improved with help from caring white people (even if these are white people with shady backgrounds). There's no need to mention that just shopping for food in the low-income communities is sometimes impossible. Maybe an already made sandwich from the corner liquor store will satisfy the kids hunger, but the city bus line to that one suburban-like big grocery store in the neighborhood one and a half miles away has been canceled and Mama's going to have to figure out another way to get some real food that's affordable. I'm sorry, but although the movie hits some subjects that need to be discussed in our society, the script needs some major work. Why can't these ultra-rich studio executives consider getting input from the social workers in the inner-city, some active residents, teachers, youths, some freshly out of jail young men who are working on cleaning themselves up, etc. Sickeningly rich movie producers just have no idea what the real world is like for most working people.

The teenyboppers would have lined up around the block if someone had filmed Travolta picking his nose for two hours. Unfortunately, he did Grease instead.Grease bears little relationship to the fun, modestly-scaled stage musical from which it takes its name. It looks a lot more like a late-70s ABC TV special with a gargantuan budget. All the elements that made ABC such a pandering, lowbrow success are present a phony, sugar-coated portrait of the 1950s (a la Laverne & Shirley), smirking double-entendres (a la Three's Company), and, of course, Travolta. The musical numbers even look cadged from a variety show -- the camera is so static during the Beauty School Dropout number you'll think it's a colorized episode of Ed Sullivan. And thematically, it's all about the importance of being cool -- could there be a more TV-worthy message? Add in special guest appearances by a battalion of TV has-beens (poor Sid Caesar) and you have an insanely overwrought sweeps-month special splashed onto the silver screen for a filmgoing public which had its collective standard lowered by Happy Days. The plot, such as it is, involves John Travolta falling in love with Olivia Newton-John, and the pair encountering a handful of easily overcome obstacles, the greatest of which seems to by Livvy's penchant for straight hair and cardigan sweaters. Travolta has made a career of looking comfortable in ridiculously contrived circumstances, and as Danny Zuko, he's perfectly believable belting out an angst-drenched torch song in front of an animated hot dog jumping into a bun. The lovely Miss Newton-John fares much worse. She can't act and she's a very limited singer (please note Have You Never Been Mellow), and up to this point she had survived on her sincerity and sweetness (again Have You Never Been Mellow). The transformation of her character Sandy from sap to sex goddess neatly parallels Olivia's not-wholly-successful attempt to do the same with her career she spent the years after Grease trying to be sultry, kind of a pre-Madonna Madonna, and all she wound up with was a million-selling aerobics anthem (Physical). As for the supporting cast, it's a pretty mixed lot. There are bona fide talents like Stockard Channing, who plays Rizzo, leader of the girls' gang the Pink Ladies, and is far too old for the role but brings real sassiness to Look At Me, I'm Sandra Dee and real sadness to There Are Worse Things I Could Do. And there are pieces of human scenery like Jeff Conaway, who plays Kenickie, the world's least threatening thug. And there are slumming pros like Eve Arden and Joan Blondell, who add nostalgia appeal and look happy to be getting a paycheck. The songs, save for the obscenity-sprinkled Greased Lightning, are pretty bland and sound like overproduced cover versions of 50's R&R, plus, the musical sequences in the film are utter yawns to a generation raised on the jump-cut editing of MTV. If your attention doesn't wander while Livvy is wandering around a back yard warbling the Connie Francis knockoff Hopelessly Devoted To You, you have superhuman powers of concentration. So why do I know so much about this movie, which I dislike so much? Well, I was a tween in the late 70s, when pop culture was boring put flawlessly promoted, so people my age were force-fed bilge like Grease and swallowed it whole.

This time around, the in-jokes are the best thing in the movie, while the story, particularly in the overblown conclusion, suffers from merely repeating key scenes from the first film. Now, this might be a satire on the lack of originality in most horror sequels, and it would work if the characters were developed correctly. Sadly, such a thing doesn't happen, with Sidney being reduced to the usual girl who keeps running and screaming (fitting, huh?) and everyone else (including Liev Schreiber, who gets more screen-time in the sequel) playing stereotypes, with the exception of David Arquette, very likable as the nice cop again trying to solve the case, and Kennedy, who has a great time stating the rules to follow in a sequel.Ironically, the movie's funniest scene has a bunch of film students discussing follow-ups that are better than the originals. And while few could have anything bad to say about Aliens, Terminator 2 or The Godfather Part II, it must be said that Scream 2, while fun and watchable, most certainly doesn't have the same sharpness that made its predecessor an above-average horror film.

The fact I was brought up on James Bond films from the Connery era through to end of Moore's reign is probably the sole ingredient that my liking of an espionage film every once in a while is a matter of fact. The genre has also been given a recent boost thanks to films like Goldeneye and the Bourne series. Even if this was my first expedition into the Clancy\/Ryan world, I was overall, a little disappointed.The film is steady, if not unspectacular pretty much from the off. Various characters are introduced and the actual situation is introduced in a steady and very planned manner. I liked the idea of a nuclear warhead out in the open from the very beginning; going against what Goldeneye did by revolving the early part of its plot around the planning and stealing of the device although it probably, in truth, worked better that way. Credit to The Sum of All Fears though; as the way it did it was refreshing.As for the characters, we have the president of the United States played by, as ever, a middle aged aging man that has a miniature army of suits running around him doing most of the work, we have an expert and mentor to the film's hero who is at first above the protagonist in question and then we have the man himself Jack Ryan. Even though I'm no expert, I know that this isn't Ryan's first adventure and having a young Ben Affleck play the lead did misfire but I don't blame Affleck because the character, by now, is so experienced thanks to his previous expeditions, does he really need all the mentoring and 'kid' small talk thrown in his direction? It would seem the producers used relatively elder actors such as Baldwin and Ford for the first films but then opted for youth for the latter film in the series&#150; odd film-making. Thanks to this, I got the feeling this was his very first assignment.What slows the film down is, ultimately, a poor script. We hover around Ryan and his girlfriend too much in the early scenes; something that turned out to be a pointless exercise when we should be spending this time introducing the villain and having him set up his plan as a good spy\/espionage film needs a villain of some sorts. As it is, we get about ten seconds in total of a guy I didn't actually catch the name of talk nastily down the phone to some Arabs or something about the bomb that has been found. All that I conjured was that he was a South African. This lack of a villain came back and bit the film later on, as well.Another nag I felt consisted of everything up until the bomb exploding in Baltimore. It felt that everything was really, just building up to this one moment and when it actually came; I distinctly felt the film speed up in an odd way; it stuck with the same subject matter of people bickering and talking to one another but now, everything actually meant something as a terrorist attack had actually occurred. Shortly after this event however, we see Jack Ryan running through the remains of Baltimore or some other place affected by the blast. He manages to use a cell phone or something, gets in contact with a V.I.P and the use of slow motion as he gets out of the situation was all a bit silly.Like I was saying with the lack of a villain, the film suffers in its middle third as there are no real obstacles for Ryan to overcome. There are no fights for him to fight apart from maybe a scrap with a guard in a warehouse from whom he wants information from but Ryan leaves without it; just as his allies arrive and subdue his enemy. In the end, the tension between America and Russia and their nuclear war threats are rather predictably concluded.Although scraping by with what it does, the film never really feels like a roller-coaster ride of suspicion and intrigue as good espionage films should.

The props and CGI used for the other creatures, such as Chewbacca, may not be acceptable if Star Wars came out today, but were great for back then. Costume design was magnificent, especially the great details put into the villainous character of Darth Vader, who is perhaps the most memorable movie villain ever. Although he wouldn't really make his terror so profound and complete until the first sequel The Empire Strikes Back. The concept of the Death Star is also a fine one.But while Star Wars most certainly looks great in terms of detail and special effects, and even moreso on the entertainment level, there are some details that I have a really hard time accepting.

However, his workaholic and limelight-seeking tendencies ruined one relationship with an underling (Laura Linney). Now comes the case of all cases. The archbishop of Chicago has been brutally murdered and the suspect is an innocent looking vagrant named Aaron (Edward Norton). Martin decrees that he MUST represent Aaron so he offers the young man his services pro bono, knowing the publicity for the trial will place them both squarely in the news for weeks and weeks.

In my opinion, Chaplin's voice simply did not fit his silent characters that made him rich and famous. His career never recovered when sound came to film. Contrary to most of the reviews I have read, Chaplin's lifestyle and politics did not help his popularity with the average viewer who expected to be entertained by Chaplin the comedian, and not spend their entertainment dollar watching Chaplin's political commentary.Despite Chaplin's awards and knighthood, I would take exception to his contributions to humanity. The Great Dictator was made at the same time Stalin's brutal dictatorship was having it's show trials, and both Dictators signed the agreement that lead to invasion of Poland by both Dictators. WWII started in an attempt to save Poland. The Nazi's were defeated in 6 years, but Poland disappeared as a sovereign country. This happened during the time this film was made and the investigations of Hollywood by the Federal government. Had Chaplin included Joe Stalin in this satire,in addition to including the Italian dictator, perhaps he would have had less criticism about his politics by the politicians. The Soviet's mistreatment of Jews and dissidents exceeded the Nazi's in time and numbers.Judged simply as a film, many of the gags were too topical to be understood by younger viewers, who wouldn't know who Goebbels, Goring or Mussolini were.

A 14-year old boy Jason Shepherd wrote an English paper called Big Fat Liar. When his skateboard was taken, he had to use his sister's bike to get to the college on time and he hit a limo. When he went into the limo, he met a famous producer from Hollywood, Marty Wolf. When he left the limo, he forgot one thing his paper! So Marty Wolf took it and he turned Jason's English paper into a movie! When Jason admitted that he left his paper in the limo and Marty took it, his parents and his English teacher didn't believe him! So Jason and his friend Kaylee had to fly to Los Angeles to go to Hollywood to make Marty admit he stole his story to Jason's parents. When Jason told Marty to call his dad that Marty stole that paper, Marty tricked him and burned his paper! Jason got so angry that Marty burned that paper so Marty called security to get Jason out of his site! Jason and Kaylee realized Marty isn't going to admit the truth. In order to take Marty down in Phase 2 The Takedown, Jason and Kaylee put permanent blue dye into the pool and when Marty jumps in, his body turns all blue and it wouldn't come off! Then they put permanent orange dye in Marty's shampoo and when he uses it, his hair turns all orange and it wouldn't come off too! Finally, they put lots of glue on Marty's earpiece to make him call Jason's father and when Marty uses it, it sticks to his ear! It was funny when Marty's hair and body turns all blue and orange and his headset is glued to his ear! After that, they tricked Marty by telling Monty, who is Marty's assistant, that Duncan moved to a house where there's a party going on. When Marty went in to see Duncan, he was at the wrong house and all the kids at the party beat him up! When Marty was in the house, Jason and Kaylee switched the controls of his car. When Marty drove his car, he knew all the controls were switched and he didn't know which button to push. He's stupid enough to fall for it. When Marty hit the rear end of the masher, the masher wrecked his car! It was so funny. So Marty starts to call Jason's dad and tricked him again! He was on the phone, but it wasn't his father, he called security! After the security got Jason and Kaylee out of Marty's site, they suggested them to go home. Monty was going to be on Jason and Kaylee's side cause she knew that Marty was a liar and a jerk so she told Rocco, who is one of the security guards that she will take care of the kids. Jason told his father the truth of what he's been up to for the past 2 days and had his parents come to L.A. When Monty came to the kids, she's going to help the kids move into Phase 4 The Payback. Jason splits the crew into 3 teams for Phase 4. One team will distract and trick Marty until Jason's parents get to the set. Marty first rode with Frank Jackson, but his car broke down so he rode with Jaleel, but he took him into the desert and leave him there. When Marty was in the desert, a helicopter came to rescue him. After that, one of the blades are jammed so Marty and the pilot got off the helicopter. After that, he was on the way to the set and when Jason saw him, Marty stopped and saw what Jason has his monkey! So Marty went after Jason and Kaylee and when they saw Lester, he released the water and when the water came, it pushed Marty away.

Please pay special attention to it &#150; it carries several messages of the final twists embedded into the sound track.It is a male dominated movie but the other sex who love different and new cinema would also love it.

Small details that are obviously missed during the first viewing would be revealed after 2-3 viewing &#150; once you know the ending.Edward Norton has played his role to perfection (I had seen him recently in The Illusionist and found him stone faced), Brad Pitt takes the guts out of you and his larger than life persona would be remembered for many years and accomplished actress Helena Carter plays her role with mysterious oomph and style &#150; great trio on work.The best part of the movie &#150; if you miss it during the first viewing is its background sound track. Please pay special attention to it &#150; it carries several messages of the final twists embedded into the sound track.It is a male dominated movie but the other sex who love different and new cinema would also love it. I would surely highly recommend to all movie-buffs friends.Jut a trivia &#150; this movie is rated number 31 in all time classic lists of 250. Does not that say a lot about the movie?

It sounded like a typical boxing ring movie to me &#150; but due to the eagerness of suggestion, I thought of viewing it right away on the borrowed DVD.This is a shocker of a movie! You could hate it or love it. My thoughts were shifting on the scales from one extreme to the other &#150; what is going on? What is the purpose of the movie? What is the message of the movie? What does it want to convey? I had to sleep over the movie before I sat down to write this review.The movie is about the main protagonist guy &#150; Edward Norton playing an insomniac, who comes in touch with first with Marla Singer &#150; played by Helena Carter &#150; and later on with the dynamo of a guy - Tyler Durden &#150; played brilliantly by Brad Pitt in his bigger than screen performance. From that time &#150; the movie takes a roller coaster ride to unbelievable incidences, situations and thought processes that churn the mind out of the viewers. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton set up a fight club that grows into many cities around US and becomes an underground mayhem causing outfit. There is a final twist &#150; like all the classic movies have; that builds up the scope for me to view it again and again! I think that this is a fantastic movie. Not by the sense of acceptance of what is going on in the movie &#150; but the narration of a concept that is so weird. I like movies because it takes one to those areas of human beings that are not dwelled in before. Many attempts are made to showcase a dark side of human nature &#150; not many are successful in doing that.

It stands out from most movies I've ever seen in that it seems to follow no rules, to have no limits. It doesn't follow some standard over used formula as the majority of movies do (not that that can't work well, for example the Spider-man movies).I don't think it's about finding some simple solution or philosophy for life - it's about asking questions that people don't normally ask and pushing these ideas to their extremes. The answers and overall meaning of the movie are left to the audience. Is it about an insomniac that gradually turns insane and takes some pretty stupid ideas way too far? Or is it suggesting that we are prisoners of our society the way it is and need to free ourselves and find out who we really are (by fighting each other and blowing things up 'n' stuff)?Either way, I found the movie very thought provoking and refreshingly original. The violence in Fight Club didn't bother me the least bit. I'm sure there are plenty of people that enjoy this movie primarily for the violence but I don't that should mean the movie is criticised for it's violence (as many critics have). After all, it is integral to the story and it's a superficial point to dismiss a movie on.Controversial philosophical ideas aside, Fight Club is also pretty funny (in a dark way), satirising the nature of modern consumerism and repetitive office work. Viewed as more of a dreamt philosophical exploration than a series of real events I think the humour really comes out. The book seems to have this kind of tone, I don't think it's all meant to be taken literally or too seriously.I thought the directing, acting, writing (dialogue in particular) and editing were all top notch and the music by the Dust Brothers was pretty cool too (and fitted well with the movie). I highly recommend Fight Club to anyone who hasn't yet seen it, I doubt it will be quite like anything else you've ever seen.

But all he finds is an island of pagans who give him the run-around. Now he must not only find the girl but defend his own Christianity.While the remake of this film was a complete travesty (see other review), it had the positive side effect of exposing the original to a new audience, myself included. I am grateful for this, because The Wicker Man is wonderful.The acting is great, with a very special appearance by Christopher Lee, and the scenery is beautiful. I enjoyed the directing, and I am especially partial to the music. One scene involving a nude dance was very 1970s but also timeless for its beauty (the nudity is purely aesthetic, not erotic).The best part of this film, though, is beyond a doubt the religious overtones. While you would expect the Christian detective to be the hero, he actually comes across as more of an oppressor. His condemnation of the simple ways of the islanders make him out to be the villain, despite being the protagonist of the story. I thought this was a very clever way to tell a story... something the remake completely ignored.This is horror in a very different sense than we know today. There is no fear, no scaring the audience and little or no gore (a trickle of blood once or twice). There is almost no violence, and even the nudity is lacking in sex. Yet, somehow, there is a horror undercurrent here due to the upheaval of mainstream values with unsettling alternatives. Awesome! I don't know if I could more highly recommend this film. For those who want a slasher and guts, they're going to be disappointed and possibly confused. But those who like horror to be a little intellectual and leave you thinking, this is one for your shelves. I think the fact this film has sat quietly in the background for so many years is a shame and really ought to be changed -- can we revive the elements this film has mastered?

Subpar special effects also--although I DID like the cartoon lightning that comes from Danning's fingers. There's also a werewolf orgy which is particularly stupid and Danning takes off her top at least EIGHT TIMES during the closing credits! There are a few good things--I found the village in Transylvania amusing--it looks like it came from a Universal horror flick from the 1930s! There are interesting camera tricks between transition scenes; Brown and McEnroe have good bodies and Lee and Danning are good in this--but they can't save it. Really--WHY did they do this? Where they that hard up for money??? This is one of IMDb's lowest rated movies. That alone should tell you something. Supposedly Danning was horrified when she saw the movie--I can understand why!
