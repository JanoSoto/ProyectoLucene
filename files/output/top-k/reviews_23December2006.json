It's even more frighteningly accurate in its prophesies about leading government officials' willingness to abandon long venerated American principles and trash the Constitution in the name of countering terrorism. The humiliation and degradations of Abu Ghraib, Baghram Air Base and Guantanamo are eerily foreshadowed, as is warrant-less surveillance of American citizens, counter-productive conflicts between competing US government organizations and the government's tendency to stigmatize and oppress large numbers of innocent American citizens. Where its prophecies fail is in not anticipating that horrific civil rights abuses and un-American behaviors will originate in the White House no less than the Congress, and in supposing that underlings far from the halls of power will ultimately show sufficient strength of character to end these abuses.

","genre":"Action, Thriller"},{"date":"23 December 2006","score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Although needless and severely lacking the element of surprise, this sequel to James Whale's classic twosome Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein is an astonishingly great film, containing some of the best acting performances of all the Universal horrors and unquestionably featuring the most impressive decors and cinematography of vintage American cinema. Director Rowland V. Lee takes us back to the stylish sets of German Expressionism, yet he terrifically blends it all with the familiar and chilling story lines of Whale's originals. Son of Frankenstein unites no less than FOUR legendary horror names in its cast and two of them &#150; Lionel Atwill and Bela Lugosi &#150; give away their finest performances ever. Several decades after the initial tragedies that hit the little European town, Baron Frankenstein's son Wolf returns to the cursed place with his wife and five year old son. Supposedly just to claim his inheritance, but Frankenstein junior rapidly becomes obsessed with his father's misunderstood work and decides to stay, very much against the will of the townsfolk. When visiting the old laboratory, he discovers that that his father's former assistant Ygor still guards the monsters inside a hidden crypt and even agrees to revive it once again using his father's notes. Wolf is unaware, however, that the malicious Ygor is only interested in the monster's inhuman strength and abuses him to kill the eight jury members that sentenced him to death for snatching corpses. This sequel is reminiscent to the other two films, yet at the same time an entirely different accomplishment. Frankenstein's persona is more or less the same, namely a gifted researcher who has a bit of trouble distinguishing moral from science, but Karloff's monster is portrayed entirely different all of a sudden. There were he still had human characteristics and emotions in the other two films, he merely is a dangerous killing attribute here, operated by the truly malicious and mad raving Ygor. Perhaps the abrupt change in themes and the genius transition of evil to the formerly supportive character of Ygor is the best thing that could have happened to an overly known series as Frankenstein. As stated before, the sets are breathtaking and bringing back the fond memories of such German milestones as Der Januskoph and Das Cabinet des Dr. Caligari. Every interior filming location, whether it's the Frankenstein mansion, the deserted laboratory or the town's courtroom, is like a magical labyrinth of secret passageways and gloomy shadows and the tense atmosphere these bizarre constructions create is superb. And even when you aren't admiring the sets & scenery for a minute, there are still multiple strong moments to experience, like Constable Krogh's (Atwill) tremendously chilling story of how he ended up as a simple small town police man with an artificial arm. Or the interrogation of Ygor by a suspicious town's council regarding the several unsolved murders! Especially remarkable is that these exact same two characters also provide the film with brilliant flashes of comedy! Krogh's fake and difficult to operate arm provide some genuine laughs (never play darts with someone who has a wooden arm!) and you haven't lived until you see Ygor spit at a jury of prominent citizens. Boris Karloff is indeed sadly underused in this installment, but his presence is naturally required, if only just to complete one of the most staggering ensemble casts in cinema ever. The first scene where Basil Rathbone and Bela Lugosi are standing around the table where Boris Karloff's body is lying has now become one of my most fond & treasured horror memories. Son of Frankenstein is a great classic horror achievement in its own right; highly recommended to all the real film-lovers.
