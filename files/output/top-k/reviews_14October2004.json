Everyone seems to put it down because they say it's overacted or stereotypical, but I've never thought so.The story itself is interesting, a gay rehab camp dedicated to turning gays into upstanding heterosexual citizens. The movie pokes fun at many typical clichés and stereotypes associated with gays, but each character (from the Gothic Sinead to Jewish Joel) has something unique about them that makes them lovable.The characters, especially Megan and Graham, develop so much throughout the movie, and the visuals (especially the blues and pinks of True Directions) are eye popping.I'd definitely recommend this, for gays and straights alike, since the story's values (being yourself and loving who you want) can pertain to anyone.

This movie is placed together very well, it not only explores a broken family, but a broken person fixed by the love of his dyin father. i watch this movie probably at least 3 times a month and it never ceases to make me cry. it's not so much the fact that the plot is emotional, but these actors make it seem so real, and although i know it's their job to do that, i think they have extremely well. I am, understandably an emotional person who has felt the loss of a parent at a young age, and i guess it's that in the movie which hits close to home. I would personally recommend this to anyone who wants a movie bout broken families, and reunited love. a tearjerker to those who feel the plot and brokenness of a boy and his journey.

The casting was right on. The characters are so boring and stupid, I feel sorry for them. William H. Macy is great as a defeated, desperate car salesman who needs cash fast. He hires these two bungling idiots to kidnap his wife for ransom. His wealthy father-in-law is supposed to put up the ransom money. He has an inflated ego and says Dammit. I want to be a part of this. He wants to personally deliver the ransom money in hopes of not actually having to part with it. Jerry keeps uttering the same question. What the heck do you mean and you realize he doesn't have a clue. Buscemi wants money, conversation and sex. (he is kinda funny looking and uncircumsized) Stormari wants pancake house, his smokes and the car. Margie, Frances McDormand, wants her husbands artwork to be on a stamp, to have her baby and to solve a crime. She eats her way through the entire movie. Oh yes, there is the snow. The blinding white snow, everywhere you look, more snow. Frances McDormand deserved her Oscar.I wish more films could be as entertaining as this one. Give us more, Coen brothers!

Eastwood is classic as grizzled Secret Service Agent Frank Horrigan and Rene Russoholds her own as partner (and love interest) Lilly Raines. But the movie'sgreatness rests on the shoulders of John Malkovich as Booth. He capturesthis character's rage and hatred, as well as his humanity oddly enough. Personally I think this was his best performance and should have received anOscar for it (But I loved Tommy Lee Jones in The Fugitive as well that year). Overall a great movie to see you want to peek into an assassin's mind and beon the edge of your seat the whole way through. Enjoy!!
