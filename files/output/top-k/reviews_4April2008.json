[{"date":"4 April 2008","score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" When Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson put their heads together, do not expect plain old brainstorming. Expect a hurricane of theatrical proportions that drops an ocean of legendary imagery. In its aftermath you can find the pieces to a great monumental movie that only its creators could assemble so perfectly. And Anderson takes charge indeed in this modestly underrated tour deforce. Full of wit, hilarious lines, chemistry, sincerity, subliminal messages, betrayal, vengeance, and kite flying, Rushmore seems to have it all. It stands as their second prodigy-child, a brilliant masterpiece that paves the way for The Royal Tenenbaums.Rushmore is the story of Max Fischer, a nerdy, yet courageous, fifteen-year-old genius with unstoppable determination. Unfortunately his overachievement leads to an overload of extracurricular activities and bad grades that will threaten his greatest passion, attending Rushmore. With impeccable handwriting that matches his hairdo and exemplifies his demeanor, young Max is driven by a rush of testosterone to conquer a beauty twice his age, Ms. Cross. Bill Murray plays Mr. Blume, a steel tycoon that finds inspiration in Max and soon enough, falls for Ms. Cross. Consequently, the story takes a dive into an unwieldy love triangle that turns into a superfluous war and ironically ends with a play of the Vietnam War.Max's greatest virtuosity is staging elaborate high school plays which add another dimension to the film as they are presented to the viewer randomly. They intriguingly echo the movie's itinerary as much as the soundtrack does. Never has a movie's score been so exquisitely choreographed. It almost feels like a musical without the excessive corniness. Together, it all meshes perfectly to glorify the tenacity and leadership required to create something as grand as a play or a movie. That's why Rushmore could very likely be a self-portrait of its own creators. Either way, Anderson provides us with a poetic look at achievement, glory, and the power of theater.The directing and the writing seem to go hand in hand; this seems logical since Anderson does both. But there is an impervious intention to make them cohesive, like written poetry complementing the grace of a painting. His shots are composed elegantly, balanced, and sometimes symmetrical. Panoramic fisheyes introduce a setting and strong close-ups emphasize moments of beauty or climatic emotion; i.e., when Bill Murray's character falls in love with Max's girl. Another camera trick is used to emphasize Max's immaturity. The already small actor, Jason Schwartzman, is cropped in such a way that he looks tiny. Anderson makes his intentions clear when Max is conversing with Ms. Cross about their age difference making it impossible to have a relationship; this is also one of the wittiest scenes in the whole movie.Anderson's opus could not be what it is without the amazing cast. The three strung-out characters are played so vividly and with a rawness that contrasts heavily with the inflated acting of Max's plays. However, the director's eloquence pulls through and seems to illuminate every bit of the film. Every line just seems perfect. The solid acting allows the characters to permeate the audience while giving performances that stay with you for days. There are a few moments of stark deliberation to leave the audience modestly uncomfortable and a bit provoked, every cinematographer's dream, right? Being familiar with Anderson's technique does make for the dry humor and awkwardness to be a lot more digestible. But even the newbies will find the overflow of references to handjobs by the second half of the movie to be surprisingly comfortable.Again, the performances make Rushmore unforgettable. Bill Murray liked the script so much that he almost did it for free. An actor of this caliber did so much with so little playing a man of few words, relying more on gestures and a powerfully austere presence. Always drunk or smoking and very depressed, Murray adds to the character with improvisations throughout the film. Following the same natural technique is Jason Schwartzman, making it hard to believe that is not himself on the screen. The kid is only seventeen and plays his first movie with such confidence and authenticity that even at times outshines a veteran like Murray. Attention is paid to the smallest nuances the scratching of the nose when a good repartee is required. Finally, Olivia Williams plays the love interest that keeps her cool through most of the film. She sure is a catch, excessively honest, lovable, and a bit naive. The rest of the cast is also quirky and perfect.The ending is powerful; almost tear jerking, as the curtains drop and the perfect song with the perfect lyrics seals the deal.

Even though he says as little as possible you can still follow his emotions. For this, also credits needs to go to Sylvester Stallone. of course lots of people have criticized his acting over the years, the same as all big action movie actors got criticized.

Vangelis' score is simply brilliant, a well-deserved Oscar. The costume and set-decoration add to the authenticity of the film's time period. The work of cinematography gives the dramatic feeling of the film. The screenplay and actors are good. But of the other nominees for Best Picture in 1981, I found this to be a feeble win at the Academy.Unlike On Golden Pond, the movie does not develop great characters nor does it have memorable performances like Henry Fonda and Katherine Hepburn delivered. The motives of the two runners, Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross) and Eric Liddell (Ian Charleson) are understandable. Both are competitive individuals and with such a competition, they push themselves harder and harder. But they both come from different religious families.Harold, who's Jewish, feels it is his obligation to make himself the best, for fame and to escape prejudice. However, there is no external conflict shown in the movie that makes him feel so determined to be the best. For most individuals, it takes something from the past to spark someone's heavy interest in such a thing. A person just doesn't wake up one morning and say I'm going to be a runner. I felt his character wasn't developed, just thrown into Cambridge, running laps, saying, I need to do better than this to the amusing Ian Holm.It is also the same with Eric. As a catholic Scot, he feels it's his job to win for God. Well, why? Sure, the film shows that he has a religious uptight family, but the story does not broaden off of that. The movie doesn't even bother to develop his relationship that diminishes with his significant other. So, I am left as a mere observer rather than being pulled into the film.The only thing that pulled me into the film was Vangelis' score which made the movie. I enjoyed the slow-motion images of the runners running, but it got very tiresome after awhile, particularly at the end of the movie with the Olympic Games. I couldn't help but laugh at the actor's faces as they ran in slow-motion. It almost made me think of the different expressions Bruce Banner would make as he's mutating into the Hulk.In addition without strong character development, the accents are very thick.

That's the smart meaning of this comedy. And what's even more smart is how that serious meaning was made through a comedy. (Woody Allen) structured the story on numerous situations, which he organized in the same order how they run in his lead's mind. That lead himself is considered now an icon in terms of expressing the hesitant cultured man, who's timorous when it comes to love, commitment, and stability. The final result is something deep yet funny; to the extent that it could be the funniest psychological movie ever made. I loved that collection of daily details which formulate the lead's character eloquently, take a list  how he, as self-conceited, feels importunate necessity to prove his point of view's rightness for some guy, who hears accidentally in a line of a theater; hence it takes a brief dream appearance of (Marshall McLuhan) to assure the lead's superiority, and shut-up any disagreement. The lead's culture gets in the way between him and having sex with a beauty, while in fact it's his forever fear disguised as a discussion about who killed (JFK), where he doesn't suspect the CIA, but &#x96; really &#x96; his own sexual capacities ! The lead doesn't see anyone further himself; so he deemed dully that the need for love, ambition, encouragement, and alteration from his girl's side&#x97;are nothing but bad symptoms caused by her period! He was too blind to grasp the truth of himself as the actual reason of why his love failed. And lastly, he can't change himself, only his love story's end, which he writes as a play; because what can't be fixed in reality can be fixed in art. This is, as a whole, a profound exploration done very amusingly too. So with uniquely structured script; that provided masterly drama and comedy, lively editing, and lovely acting, (Annie Hall) has the word classic written all over it. Many next movies, some of them by Allen himself, wanted to imitate it. But they were mostly less good. Maybe because they were uncreatively subjective, stupidly vague, boringly soulless. Or maybe not as witty, intensive, or hearty as (Annie Hall).Though, the thing to bother a bit is that (Allen) with his strong consciousness and brilliant inventiveness became less attractive as time goes by, with the same problems in the same character; which produced several comedies by (Woody Allen) about (Woody Allen)'s cinematic persona. Hmmm, that's the act of someone who secludes himself into himself, and becomes incapable of change. As if (Allen) doesn't learn from his own lessons.. even they're that good !

Both are well-developed depictions of life in America during those decades with a focus around high school, growing up and making important decisions about what to do and how to live life. Both also gather a killer soundtrack from each decade and the result is more about evoking nostalgia and showing those too young to know what life was like.Director and writer Richard Linklater does good work with this film about high schoolers (mostly incoming seniors) on the last day of school. He's written characters that are fun and easy to identify (by stereotype sometimes) and identify with. The plot is just one giant misadventure involving alcohol, marijuana, high school hazing and a variety of rebellious activity. It never settles comfortably around one character, giving you enough to get to know them and be interested in what happens to them, but not enough to truly understand them or care about them. Linklater's focus appears to be showing the many ways that teens handled life and how they felt about it in 1976 through mishaps and comedic moments.The cast is a lot of fun, especially because a lot of actors when they were a bit younger appear in the film Ben Affleck, Matthew McCounaughy, Parker Posey, Adam Goldberg, Joey Lauren Adams (Big Daddy), Anthony Rapp (RENT) and even more. Nobody's a show stealer, but that's because the film isn't designed that way.Dazed and Confused is just fun. At the very least the soundtrack will have you rocking out a bit. There's no slapstick, gut-wrenching humor, you just laugh and enjoy. There's nothing moving about the movie, but you enjoy the characters and what happens to them. It's a very sound movie (no pun intended, but it work I guess) in that it's just well put together. It's not bad at all; if you don't like it it's probably because you wanted more from it.

To make it easier to understand, it feels out of place and doomed to fail (and possibly pelted with tomatoes). Shaq, as the movie poster refers to him as, plays John Henry Irons, a weapons designer for the military. After a tragic accident occurs (not the board meeting to green-light this movie), Irons retires his position and returns to the safety of his home. Within a few days back, he takes notice that his dangerous guns are running amok in the streets, thanks to Nathaniel Burke, a former sergeant (I'm probably wrong about his position, but who cares) relieved from his position for attempted destruction (and no, he wasn't the man who green-lit this movie. Okay, I'll stop). I want to stop right there and delve into the stupidity that this situation is. I'm still laughing at the fact that, instead of criminal punishment via jail time, a man bent on human destruction is just released from his military duties. What the hell?!?

For instance, when they found Saddam Huessin, instead of hanging him, they just spanked him on the ass! I'm sure that would've worked. Anyway, back to the plot (or as much of a plot there is). Once ahold of these guns, Nathaniel uses them to destroy Irons' hometown, and Irons himself. Of course, this doesn't keep Irons down, as he gets back up, renames himself Shaquille O'Neal, joins the NBA, and becomes a huge star. Okay, so this didn't happen in the movie. But I'm pretty positive this is how Shaq's career came about. My ramblings aside, Irons picks himself back up, grabs an old army buddy and Shaft (not kidding), makes himself the absolute worst looking superhero attire ever (it makes the Bat Nipples look like the Mona Lisa), dons himself Steel, and comes back to save the day, equipped with a huge sledgehammer (Triple H's inspiration), magnetic shield, and advice (once again, not kidding). The sheer stupidity that is Steel is unprecedented. Yes, I've seen worse COUGH*Batman & Robin*COUGH. But, that doesn't do justice for the man of Steel (and insults the true man of Steel, Superman, which this story is based off of a side character after the death of Superman).

Starring Elizabeth Shue, Kevin Bacon, Josh Brolin, and William Devane, this violent, trashy, unacknowledged retread of director James Whale's 1933 classic The Invisible Man offers out-of-sight special effects, buckets of blood & gore, but lacks heart, soul, and substance. This transparent $85 million trip borrows elements from the Predator movies, all those I-Am-God science fiction sagas where a mad scientist acts as his own guinea pig, and virtually every brainless slasher flick. Starship Troopers director Paul Verhoeven and End of Days scenarist Andrew W. Marlowe pose a provocative philosophical question what would you do if you were invisible? Sadly, the answer isn't as provocative.As Sebastian Coe, Kevin (Death Sentence) Bacon plays a scientific genius whose ego undermines him from the outset. Under the supervision of Dr. Howard Kramer (William Devane of Space Cowboys), Cole and fellow scientists Linda McKay (Elisabeth Shue of Leaving Las Vegas), his ex-girlfriend that he left, research assistant and rival lover Matt Kensington (Josh Brolin of American Gangster), and veterinarian Sarah Kennedy (Kim Dickens of Mercury Rising), are testing a serum that can render a man invisible. Initially, their potion succeeds one a primate. They erase a gorilla then restore it, but the ape suffers some dire side effects.Afraid the Pentagon may evict him after they obtain his miraculous results, Cole lies about his progress. Later, outside the Pentagon, McKay and Matt demand an explanation. Sebastian explains he wants to test the chemical on himself, without Dr. Kramer's approval. Inexplicably, Linda and Matt condone his unethical conduct, while Sebastian misleads the other technicians. All goes well as Cole vanishes before their eyes. He had planned to remain invisible for three days, but the serum fails to restore him, and he is trapped in a body that he cannot see and suffers from a kind of cabin fever because Linda and Matt refuse to let him go outside.Frantically, our heroes scramble for a cure. Ten days elapse without a solution. Sebastian turns psychotic and embarks on a gratuitous killing spree. Cutting his colleagues off from the outside world, he traps them in the lab and eliminates them one by one.

Anthony Quinn and Yaphet Kotto play the two high-ranking N.Y.P.D. officers that scramble to nab the trio before Mafia kingpin Anthony Franciosa can lay his hands on them with help of local black hoodlums. Apparently, it looks like Shear shot about 90 per cent of this white-knuckled actioneer on location in the ghettos of Harlem. None of the settings look like they were constructed on a sound stage. When people are wounded in Across 110th Street, they bleed bright red blood and the body count is reasonably high for this 1972 movie. The single drawback to this no-nonsense, high-octane, shoot'em up is the shortage of sympathetic characters. Essentially, there is nobody to identify with in Luther Davis's screenplay and nobody emerges as a role model. Quinn gives a gruff performance as a thirty year veteran police captain who would rather beat a confession out of a suspect than coddle him. Kotto strives to stick with the rule book. Actually, Kotto's Lieutenant Pope qualifies as the most likable character. Conversely, Anthony Franciosa steals the movie as the son of a Mafia boss who has to prove his mettle and does he ever. He castrates one of the thieves and dangles another off the side of a high-rise under construction.The action gets off to a violent start as a group of black and white buttoned down African-Americans and Italians are counting greenbacks in a seedy apartment building. Two N.Y.P.D. cops hammer at the door and warn the occupants about a parking violation. When one of the black gangstas tries to bribe them, the two cops burst into the room. Jim Harris (Paul Benjamin of Escape from Alcatraz) and Joe Logart (Ed Bernard of Blue Thunder) masquerade as New York's finest. Harris wields a lightweight machine gun and covers the five mobsters while his partner stuffs wads of cash into a suitcase. Look closely and you see future Rocky co-star Burt Young as one of the Italians. One of the African-American hoods makes a play for his automatic pistol, and Harris mows down everybody in sight with his machine gun fire. They plunge down the stairs and scramble into an old checkered cab painted black. Getaway driver Henry J. Jackson (Antonio Fargas of Cleopatra Jones) careens away from the tenement only to run into trucks that block his route and cops come sprinting out of nowhere. Harris wipes a black cop and a white cop with bursts of machine gun fire before the villains can extract themselves from their predicament.The Italian Mafia isn't happy about this hold-up, and Nick D'Salvio (Anthony Franciosa of Rio Conchos) is sent into Harlem to make an example of these three. Initially, Nick runs afoul of local Harlem kingpin Doc Johnson (Richard Ward of Mandingo), whose resemblance to legendary Harlem racketeer Bumpy Johnson is unmistakable. Later, the cops arrive in droves with Captain Frank Mattelli (Anthony Quinn of The Guns of Navarone) heading up the investigation until another officer (Tim O'Conner) pulls him aside and points out that a younger guy, Lieutenant Pope (Yaphet Kotto of Live and Let Die) has been assigned to the case for political reasons because he is black and the crime occurred in Harlem. A thirty-year veteran who conducts an investigation his own way, Mattelli rubs Pope the wrong way, but he knows the ropes better and gets results that Pope cannot because he doesn't have as well oiled a machine. As it turns out, Mattelli is on the take and likes to take a snort when things get tough. Comparably, Pope doesn't drink and he is honest. Meanwhile, D'Salvio makes more headway than either Mattelli or Pope. He catches Henry J. having the time of his life at a local brothel and tortures the hopped up thug, eventually castrating him. When they learn about Henry J.'s unfortunate fate, both Logart and Harris decide it is time to head off for greener pastures. D'Salvio catches up with Logart and throws him off a building. The more sympathetic of the thieves, Harris, appears to be home free but he forgets to take his medication with him and the mob tracks him down.Director Barry Shear pulls no punches. Across 110th Street is all about paying the consequences for your actions and everybody&#x97;but Lt. Pope&#x97;has to pay the price before this riveting law & order opus is over. As well-made but unsavory as Across 110th Street is, the film didn't do much for Shear's career.

Quinn gives a gruff performance as a thirty year veteran police captain who would rather beat a confession out of a suspect than coddle him. Kotto strives to stick with the rule book. Actually, Kotto's Lieutenant Pope qualifies as the most likable character. Conversely, Anthony Franciosa steals the movie as the son of a Mafia boss who has to prove his mettle and does he ever. He castrates one of the thieves and dangles another off the side of a high-rise under construction.The action gets off to a violent start as a group of black and white buttoned down African-Americans and Italians are counting greenbacks in a seedy apartment building. Two N.Y.P.D. cops hammer at the door and warn the occupants about a parking violation. When one of the black gangstas tries to bribe them, the two cops burst into the room. Jim Harris (Paul Benjamin of Escape from Alcatraz) and Joe Logart (Ed Bernard of Blue Thunder) masquerade as New York's finest. Harris wields a lightweight machine gun and covers the five mobsters while his partner stuffs wads of cash into a suitcase. Look closely and you see future Rocky co-star Burt Young as one of the Italians. One of the African-American hoods makes a play for his automatic pistol, and Harris mows down everybody in sight with his machine gun fire. They plunge down the stairs and scramble into an old checkered cab painted black. Getaway driver Henry J. Jackson (Antonio Fargas of Cleopatra Jones) careens away from the tenement only to run into trucks that block his route and cops come sprinting out of nowhere. Harris wipes a black cop and a white cop with bursts of machine gun fire before the villains can extract themselves from their predicament.The Italian Mafia isn't happy about this hold-up, and Nick D'Salvio (Anthony Franciosa of Rio Conchos) is sent into Harlem to make an example of these three. Initially, Nick runs afoul of local Harlem kingpin Doc Johnson (Richard Ward of Mandingo), whose resemblance to legendary Harlem racketeer Bumpy Johnson is unmistakable. Later, the cops arrive in droves with Captain Frank Mattelli (Anthony Quinn of The Guns of Navarone) heading up the investigation until another officer (Tim O'Conner) pulls him aside and points out that a younger guy, Lieutenant Pope (Yaphet Kotto of Live and Let Die) has been assigned to the case for political reasons because he is black and the crime occurred in Harlem. A thirty-year veteran who conducts an investigation his own way, Mattelli rubs Pope the wrong way, but he knows the ropes better and gets results that Pope cannot because he doesn't have as well oiled a machine. As it turns out, Mattelli is on the take and likes to take a snort when things get tough. Comparably, Pope doesn't drink and he is honest. Meanwhile, D'Salvio makes more headway than either Mattelli or Pope. He catches Henry J. having the time of his life at a local brothel and tortures the hopped up thug, eventually castrating him. When they learn about Henry J.'s unfortunate fate, both Logart and Harris decide it is time to head off for greener pastures. D'Salvio catches up with Logart and throws him off a building. The more sympathetic of the thieves, Harris, appears to be home free but he forgets to take his medication with him and the mob tracks him down.Director Barry Shear pulls no punches. Across 110th Street is all about paying the consequences for your actions and everybody&#x97;but Lt. Pope&#x97;has to pay the price before this riveting law & order opus is over. As well-made but unsavory as Across 110th Street is, the film didn't do much for Shear's career. He spent most of his life shooting name dropping television series, but Across 110th Street holds up for the most part and squeamish spectators should stay away from this bloodbath.

It's a cinematic adaptation of Nikolai Gogol's ascerbic 1842 satire of Russian feudal society, and is so definitive that it's never been remade. Naturally, mores have moved on (blunt brutality and gallows humour are no longer funny) but its datedness is mostly just requisite atavism.The carnival musicians (who may have invented modern beat-boxing(!)) are a standout, especially their lackadaisical Hey guy. Their comical Gypsy music conveys the story's shrewd\/wily cynicism and serves to skewer provincialism as Gogol intended.Transposing the setting to Hungary introduces newer audiences to the story of an illiterate carnival entertainer mistaken for the Emperor's emissary--although referencing Napoleon gets problematic.The Mayor of Klimenti (Nestor Paiva of Zorro serials fame, d.1966) kick-starts the plot, riding madly into his cousin's town of Brodny. I must go; even now he (the Inspector-General) may be here, in your midst, he blurts breathlessly amidst gulps of brandy. You almost feel sorry for him--until you see WHY his cape bulges. His Cousin Biro(Gene Lockhart) (biro in Hungarian means judge) is in no less trouble--the Inspector-General's incognito technique would trap Brodny's Mayor just the same.Director Henry Koster's genius is in revealing Brodny as only seemingly less corrupt its apparent civil order (repressed obedience) is exacted through institutionalised, class-based petty violence. When Biro brutally slaps Kovacs, the Captain of Police(Alan Hale), Koster has this start an unforgettable domino-chain of slaps down all the way to livestock.This prologue, then, impels the police to fan out patrolling all roads to Brodny and coming upon Yakov Goury's travelling Gypsy show. Georgi(Kaye) is its talented but naïve (Maybe I can't read or write, but I'm not illiterate!) and pointedly illiterate headliner flogging the snake-oil. Kaye is cute, if silly, twitching ears on cue. Since 1940 his verbal gymnastics were created by his equally talented wife, Associate Producer Sylvia Fine.One fleece-show act calls for a sickly young man with a prescription for Rix-zz-jel-knoobtz-f-f-ss-ch-ch-enn-zelminheltzigner......-Twice a day. Kaye's warm delivery conveys perfectly that doctors haven't written legibly.....ever. This prescription turns out to be Yakov's Golden Elixir. A hapless innocent, Georgi's main problem (apart from being illiterate) is that he has a conscience--a right nuisance for a con-man. His ruthless, dog-eat-dog world boss Yakov(Walter Slezak, seemingly born into the role) is instead a shifty chameleon who can actually read.Undermined by Georgi's conscience for the last time, Yakov brutally rejects his frontman after the locals riot. Homeless, hungry (Yakov confiscated the one fish he caught) and with holes in his boots, Georgi takes to the road. (Note The rider who overtakes him is rearranged footage--it no longer makes sense as Gregor, mid-flight to Brodny.) Although this adaptation still captures Gogol's wily logic, there are (another) two on screen elements that don't jibe 1. Georgi's tearing the Emperor's testimonial in half to pad his shoe. Despite needing padding, he throws one half away! This cause of his later mistaken identity beggars belief.2. Another is the substitution of Napoleon for the Emperor, when Gogol was famously scathing of Tsar Nicholas' Russian Empire. Presumably the Hungarian relocation and name-changes also account for this bizarre 1949 American oversensitivity to Tsarist Russia! The point of Gogol's shrewd observation was that authority resides in the eyes of (corrupt) beholders; and so the Brodny officials quickly jump to conclusions of Why not a tramp? Georgi's prison stay proves fateful, as he hysterically waves his boot at his captors, dislodging the remaining half of Yakov's forgery. Alan Hale has a wonderful bit goggling at the fake testimonial .....continue in this fine work to rid our land of the many evils that plague it.....Napoleon.Gene Lockhart embodies the Mayor with suitably high-strung, twitching pique. He's at the epicentre of his annoying relatives' idiosynchracies, who fill all the public service jobs; the problem with nepotism being that he can never get away from them! The running gag with the twin postmasters (real twins Sam and Lew Hearn) just compounds the Mayor's hilariously put-upon paternalism.Meanwhile, our genteel coward's three-day starvation had set up several plot devices his encounter with the foul soldiers ensures the confusion of the robbery (Hey! I'm innocent--ask the horse!); and Georgi's outraged cries about informing the Emperor now sound vaguely plausible. However, the classic food-hoarding scene exists just for laughs the payoff to his overeating is the gag about what he's offered to counteract his indigestion.Once the Brodny officials discover and attire him (repeatedly) in poor Kovacs' uniform, he's fawned over by everyone--including the Mayor's hilariously vapid wife Maria(Elsa Lanchester, never better). He's a hit singing the Golden-Globe-winning Gypsy_Drinking_Song, and rounding ....Now dis graop here, I vill make for you, shtok-shtok.....Very pret-yie, I laove you to pieces.Incongruous Russian accent notwithstanding, his biggest test turns up in the guise of a long-lost, snow-blind, dotty old general. Luckily, no-one except his resurfaced partner Yakov knows he's a fake, and it's Yakov who presses him into service as the Inspector-General (to blackmail the corrupt officials). Suddenly Georgi must discover how to really act the part. Afraid that a tear in the eye is worth two in the bush, he ponders Whose head will they jerk, whose block will they knock off? He even tries to resign in a touching letter to Yakov, but he's so popular, having captured Brodny's hopes for justice, that the officials get desperate to be rid of him--by any means necessary.

But I was reminded of this atrocity when I recently saw a news blurb about another installment of this franchise and remembered when I saw it for the first 5 times. I was serving in the Navy back in 2002 and our IT department ran a channel shown on the ship that shows movies. Apparently, someone thought it would be a good idea to show this film over and over.This movie manages to be offensive on so many different levels that it boggles the mind and violates it at the same time. The plot is unoriginal and base, the dialog is poorly written and poorly delivered, the editing is like an epileptic seizure, and yet somehow it is overglossed and shined up. Kinda like a polished turd.And as if the film wasn't just badly acted and written, it also manages to offend just about everyone with an IQ above a 10 year-old who views it. I'd say it's misogynistic, but there are no women in this movie. There are material possessions that resemble women, but when their function is to be placed on the hoods of cars for decoration, won in races, or used against other men for position, than basically you've turned once promising actresses into blow-up dolls with heartbeats. There's also plenty of racial stereotyping. Whites, Hispanics, and Asians frequently insult each other based on skin color, but hey, that's hip, yo! But I'd have to say this film is more insulting to me as a man. If you believe this movie, then all men are insecure, materialistic blowhards who are in constant competition and serve only to one-up each other. Whether who has the faster car, who can break the law more, or who can get closest to the ever elusive menage a trois. And what's sad, is that I've seen so many trailers for films that seem to ape this MTV culture of immaturity, faux-machismo, and flash-zoom editing since that basically make this the culmination of all that is bad in films today.I try to see the good in all movies, and if I can't, then I just say it's not my thing, but if someone else likes it, good for them. This is the ONLY film I cannot let off the hook. It is unforgivable and I loathe its very existence.

Prurient, anything-for-a-laugh western slapstick from Mel Brooks, who also appears as a bosom-mad governor and an Indian chief. It looks tacky and shabby, and some of the jokes completely bomb out, but the picture can get you laughing if you come across it in the requisite silly spirit. The loosely-hinged plot is just thrown away in the last reel, when Brooks apparently loses interest and turns the whole shebang into a spoof of Hollywood. Most of the cast survives the morass frizzy-haired Gene Wilder nearly goes into his brand of weird mania (though he seems held back), Madeline Kahn is the belle of the ball as a Dietrich-like saloon singer with a Barbara Walters-like speech impediment, Harvey Korman is practically on fire as sniveling Hedley Lamarr (his name used for the basis of many jokes), and Dom DeLuise is, blessedly, brief as a director. Cleavon Little is well-suited for the sheriff, but he isn't given anything funny to say or do, and being the straight man doesn't work either since he's at the center of the action (Brooks turns him into a stationary prop).
