[{"date":"23 October 2013","score":"","review":" Based on the memoirs of real life NASA engineer Homer Hickam, October Sky (an anagram for the novel 'Rocket Boys') was indeed a great family film. October Sky also stands for the date, Oct. 4, 1957 where Soviet satellite Sputnik 1 spark the Space race, and Homer Hickam's dreams of building rockets. The reason why October Sky was chosen by the studio over Rocket Boys is because they thought it wouldn't sell with women. Universal Pictures changed the title to be more inviting to a wider audience and thus it did work. Indeed, the title, October Sky has a little more feel to it, than Rocket Boys anyways. In the film, Homer Hickam (Jake Gyllenhaal), a coal miner's son sees this as an inspired to take up rocketry against his father's wishes played by the great actor Chris Cooper as John Hickam. Only Chris Cooper can load that much dignity in silence and fire off like rocket with his body language. Amazing. Just the way, that Jake and Chris's characters butt heads in this movie is intense. Both have fears and reasons to do what they do. Homer's father wasn't cruel, he was old fashioned. Homer was trying to break the mold, John had been in coal mining for his life and he came from a generation grounded. Homer wanted to fly and get out and John couldn't see it. Both characters love each other, father and son wise, but with careers, it was father VS son indeed. This movie is a capable-enough movie on its own right, and it's really serve as a great father's day movie as well. The movie teaches parents to be more open to their children's own plans for their lives, while also the world that is ever so changing. The scene where Homer tells his father who his hero is, is very emotion. Great scene, indeed. The supporting cast was great as well. Homer gets help building with his friends, Quetin (Chris Owen), Roy (William Lee Scott) and O-Dell (Chad Lindberg). It's weird in the book, Homer was more the nerd, and Quetin is the all-around kid and in the film, they change parts and looks. All likable charming American character with some background sub-plot story arches for themselves as well like Roy Lee's abusive foster father. Lot of laughs and smiles to go with their small scenes of their wacky high-jinx. Laura Dern is pretty good as the Miss Riley, the teacher that get them on the right track by helping with their math and science. However, the film does have some drawbacks. I don't think the film capture the joy and triumph of Hickham's original memoir; as it changes things up to make them more dramatic in the film such as Homer going into the mine to work, Homer meeting Wernher Von Braun and the issues with Miss Riley's health. In real life, she actually lived several years after the movie ended. It tend to jazz up the real life events way too much. There was also the fact that the boys were 8 to 14 at the time not 17. Parents would be complaining that the film is showing young children playing with rockets if they show 8 year olds. Also, Homer was more well-known by his nickname 'Sonny' in his hometown, but I think the movie change it for the better. The movie also has this predictable flat formulaic flow to it that you knew was going to happen. Still, you have to have a hard heart, if you're not moved by the film ending. You knew deep inside from the beginning that this will be a good feel movie with uplifting themes. There is great symbolism of how grounded, the community was in the beginning and how rockets change this area for the better. The movie was such a big hit, that an October Sky festival was host in the town, every year since then. One thing I love about October Sky is a warm, evocative soundtrack. Mark Isham did a great job with the main themes. The violin at the beginning gives me goosebumps every time. Also great use of 1950's to early 1960's songs as well to set the mood and settling. These songs just gives me chills and makes me happy and reminds me that from the humblest of beginnings come the greatest of men. Overall Joe Johnston's film would inspired others to look into their dreams, while also entertain them with the rich intelligence subject matter mixed with the coming of age story drama. October Sky will continue to help launch new dreams for children and adults wishing to become future rocket scientists for themselves. It's a good watch, and worth checking out.

And I had a huge love for Disney movies. Some i of course liked more then others. My first favorite was Lion King, and like two years later this movie came out. I really had a huge love for this movie, specially for Quasimodo, the songs, and all the other characters who were in it.It has been a many years since I first saw this movie, but I never forget that I was so frightened and so in love at the same time. It Is obviously one of the darkest Disney movies so far, mostly because of the sexual lust for the gypsy that the main villain Qlaude Frollo has. Even though this may be the darkest from Disney. They have also been giving us other Dark stuff in the childhood. Like in SnowWhite, Pinocchio, The Black Cauldron etc. Disney are not afraid to take some few chances. So I disagree when people say that this is (almost) like the only dark movie Disney has made. But what can we say about this film. Well, as one of my favourite movies ever, and has ever been since. It makes me kind of sad to see that a wonderful movie like this is so underrated as it is today and has been some years after it's release. I really can't understand why. I must admit, that even though it is my favorite movie ever, there is one thing that kind of could have been done differently. Like the gargoyles. I thought at first that these things was imaginary, at first it looks like they are. When Frollo comes little after the opening and visits Quasimodo and when Esmeralda comes with Phoebus wounded. all that they talked about earlier seems to have never happened. This could be a really good idea that they were Imaginary, that would kind of have made a little sense to. Since Quasimodo is all alone up in the belltower and has been the past 20 years. But at the big climax at the end, they are fighting back, with the gargoyles and everything. This is not a big deal I feel. If it was I wouldn't have made this one of my favorites anyway.What else can you say about the movie? The songs are just amazing, Alan Menken is a master in Disney songwritting, this is where he belongs and where his music really shines. I love all the songs. My two most favorite songs in this movie is Out There, and Hellfire\/Heavens Light (Hellfire could almost be discussed as one song since they are after each other and there is no dialog in the little seconds before Hellfire comes on). The Characters that is in this movie is very well written. And they do have a personality that you can admire about them. Specially for Quasimodo. He is the main character in this version. So you will feel much more of what he is going trough instead of looking as a monster in the book or other adaptations that has been made based out of The Hunchback of Notre Dame book.You will notice that compared to the book, this adaptation is very different. It has the dark elements. But some changes has been made. Like making Quasimodo the main character instead of Esmeralda. And Frollo instead of a priest he is a judge. But still has the religious faith there.It is for all to know that, when you are making and adaptation based out of a book. You must know that it is very hard to do it justice. And do it all correct to the book. And a lot of changes has to be made for the movie to be complex and still be interesting. And you are making a movie on 90 minutes from a book that has hundreds and hundreds of pages without letting something important be gone from the story. So even though the changes are many, it still could become a good movie and a good adaptation.

At the time of making The Good Earth in 1937, Hollywood was just eight years into the modern day of sound movies, or talkies. So, to put a great book about China on film, MGM would have to use white actors in its lead roles. Thus, the cast of Paul Muni, Luise Rainer, Walter Connolly, and others in the major roles. Perhaps some reviewers who bemoan these choices weren't aware of the early history of the movies. Of course, today we are used to seeing people of all colors playing respective roles on film. Even then, we should remember that one of the earliest aspects of acting was the use of make-up and costuming in which white actors would play the roles of various nationalities and races. The early Greeks and Romans used masks to change faces, race and appearances. But, well before the time of Shakespeare, the use of makeup had become common. Today, makeup is used mostly for highlighting, aging, youthful looks, and facial alterations.Pearl Buck (1892-1973), wrote the novel this film is based on. She was one of the best-known published sources for information about China in the early 20th century. Buck spent most of the first 40 years of her life in China. She was the daughter of missionaries, and after she married, she and her husband lived there many more years. Their last several years were spent in university teaching positions. It was during this time that Buck began writing her stories about China. She won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1938. China and the Chinese people always remained home to Buck who lived her last three decades in England. She had a Chinese name &#x96; Sai Zhenzhu. According to accounts about the early planning and production of this film, some in Hollywood were worried. The U.S. and the world still were in a recession. Much of the U.S. was suffering from the Dust Bowl. Would the viewing public want to see a film about farmers in China? the producers wondered. Would people pay to see this movie? But Buck's book, The Good Earth, had been a best-seller in both 1931 and 1932, and earned the author the Pulitzer Prize for the novel in 1932. Hollywood gambled and the gamble paid off. MGM did a marvelous job creating the sets and filming the scenes of China as described by Buck in her book. The movie is a great picture of the land and living of the Chinese people in a society that was then predominantly rural. The acting was superb by the major leads and all the supporting cast. The direction and musical scores were excellent. And the special effects of the locust swarms and rainstorms were exceptional and very realistic. I doubt that the advanced technical tools and CGI we have today could make a film as impressive or real. The Good Earth film is a faithful presentation of a classic book. It is Pearl Buck's tale about family, love, wealth and poverty, hunger and plenty, pride and humility. It's themes and sub-themes are as applicable today as they were in the 1930s. They are as true for the U.S., Europe and any other place, as they were and are for China. And, The Good Earth is a tale about the land that bound the people together in times of want and times of plenty. It is a movie for all ages and all times. If you haven't seen it yet, don't miss it. A personal aside, that may be of interest. One year in the early 1960s, I was involved with four theater plays at a small Midwestern college. We had no students of color try out for roles, so we used makeup to change actors' races or colors. For the four-act Chinese Theater play, Lady Precious Stream, all of the cast were made up as Chinese. For Davy Crockett and His Coonskin Cap, a children's theater play, several of us were made up as Native American Indians. And, for Lillian Helmer's The Little Foxes, I was made up with black face paint, a hair permanent and powdered curly hair for the character of the elderly Black butler, Cal. We had one other one-act play in which sailors from a ghost ship were made up in a gray-greenish makeup to look like ghouls from the deep.

She was one of the best-known published sources for information about China in the early 20th century. Buck spent most of the first 40 years of her life in China. She was the daughter of missionaries, and after she married, she and her husband lived there many more years. Their last several years were spent in university teaching positions. It was during this time that Buck began writing her stories about China. She won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1938. China and the Chinese people always remained home to Buck who lived her last three decades in England. She had a Chinese name &#x96; Sai Zhenzhu. According to accounts about the early planning and production of this film, some in Hollywood were worried. The U.S. and the world still were in a recession. Much of the U.S. was suffering from the Dust Bowl. Would the viewing public want to see a film about farmers in China? the producers wondered. Would people pay to see this movie? But Buck's book, The Good Earth, had been a best-seller in both 1931 and 1932, and earned the author the Pulitzer Prize for the novel in 1932. Hollywood gambled and the gamble paid off. MGM did a marvelous job creating the sets and filming the scenes of China as described by Buck in her book. The movie is a great picture of the land and living of the Chinese people in a society that was then predominantly rural. The acting was superb by the major leads and all the supporting cast. The direction and musical scores were excellent. And the special effects of the locust swarms and rainstorms were exceptional and very realistic. I doubt that the advanced technical tools and CGI we have today could make a film as impressive or real. The Good Earth film is a faithful presentation of a classic book. It is Pearl Buck's tale about family, love, wealth and poverty, hunger and plenty, pride and humility. It's themes and sub-themes are as applicable today as they were in the 1930s. They are as true for the U.S., Europe and any other place, as they were and are for China. And, The Good Earth is a tale about the land that bound the people together in times of want and times of plenty. It is a movie for all ages and all times. If you haven't seen it yet, don't miss it. A personal aside, that may be of interest. One year in the early 1960s, I was involved with four theater plays at a small Midwestern college. We had no students of color try out for roles, so we used makeup to change actors' races or colors. For the four-act Chinese Theater play, Lady Precious Stream, all of the cast were made up as Chinese. For Davy Crockett and His Coonskin Cap, a children's theater play, several of us were made up as Native American Indians. And, for Lillian Helmer's The Little Foxes, I was made up with black face paint, a hair permanent and powdered curly hair for the character of the elderly Black butler, Cal. We had one other one-act play in which sailors from a ghost ship were made up in a gray-greenish makeup to look like ghouls from the deep. Without the makeup, we couldn't have made the unreal seem so real.

Basically middle aged Iranian man Mr. Badii (Homayoun Ershadi) is driving through Tehran in his car looking for someone to help him, and he is offering a large sum of money for whoever will do the job he is asking, he wants to commit suicide, and he is looking for someone to bury his body after he is dead, in a spot he has already chosen. He picks up random people as prospective candidates, starting with friendly conversation, getting to know more about them, and then eventually one by one he reveals his plan to them, all he needs them to do is cover him with earth in the grave he has dug, their reactions all seem different. The young and shy Kurdish soldier (Afshin Khorshid Bakhtiari) is quickly shocked by the proposal and refusing to do the job runs away from the car, the Afghan seminarist (Mir Hossein Noori) is against a man killing himself for religious reasons and also refuses to do the job, but the third man, an Azeri taxidermist (Abdolrahman Bagheri), does not object. The taxidermist is willing to do the job, because he needs the money to give to his sick child, but he tries to persuade Mr. Badii not to kill himself, because he attempted suicide himself and only stopped after tasting mulberries (this is obviously the meaning behind the title), but he agrees he will cover his body if he finds him in the grave and dead in the morning. That night Mr. Badii leaves his car and walks in the darkness to the grave, a thunderstorm is beginning, but he lies in the hole, and he presumably kills himself, as the film blacks out, and the final shots of the film are behind the scenes camcorder footage of the crew making the film. In the leading role Ershadi gives a compelling performance, it is interesting you do not find out why the character wishes to kill himself, but on the other hand it adds to the intrigue of him trying to find someone willing to put him in the ground after he's done himself in, based on morality and mortality it is a fascinating story and most watchable drama. Very good!

As there takes place as fight for a fertile piece of land. The vendetta proves greatest than she could ever imagine .This devastating follow-up takes up the tale of envy , deception , ambition and jealousy in 1920s rural France .
