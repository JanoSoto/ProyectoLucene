I got a sneaking suspicion that I wouldn't like it half as much as I did when I was 15. I've always defended this story of a future world where even the police force is run by a corrupt corporation. Murphy, a dedicated cop, is killed by a gang of criminals, and his body is soon transformed into an experimental cyborg policeman. But can the corporation who built him totally erase his past? Will the bad guys just keep on getting badder, and will the corporation delve deeper into corruption? I don't think we need two guesses at the answers to these questions!There's something quaintly old fashioned about Robocop. Peter Weller's moral cop\/robot reminds me of various figures from old Westerns, but in most other respects the film is very much a product of it's time. The themes addressed are the themes of the 80s - TV, nuclear war, globalisation, urban violence, etc. Watching Robocop again makes you realise that all these issues are still with us - we're just so used to having them presented to us through highly paid spin doctors that we don't see them for what they are. Is Robocop's Omni Consumer Products really so far away from the enormous media and consumer conglomerations that have formed in the 12 years since it was released?As much as Verhoeven would like us to read such deeper issues into the film, it doubtlessly works best on a much simpler level. As an 80s action flick, it has few parallels, being exceptionally well made, exceptionally violent (especially the director's cut) and almost, but not quite, as entertaining as it was when I was 15. The casual blasting away of the bad guys may cause a few fascist, right-wing alarm bells to ring in my head these days, but it's a solid bit of fun while it lasts.The acting is generally decent, and the dialogue passable, but some of the effects seem very dated now - indeed, I seem to recall they looked pretty bad in 1987 too!I may no longer consider it to be quite as important a film these days, but it'll still go down well if I'm in the right mood. And there are many scenes that anyone who sees it will always remember - the melting man anyone?

For the first 40 minutes or so I was actually quite intrigued with the story of a young bus boy (Mark Wahlberg) who meets a top porn film director (Burt Reynolds) who sets out to make him a star in the seedy world of pornography, drugs and disco. The problem is that after 40 minutes the story takes a nose dive and the result is a total mess. From then on you have to sit through over 2 hours of total mishmash as Wahlberg and Reynolds get more irritating by the minute.  Not even the presence of screen beauties Julianne Moore and Heather Graham make you care what happens as the script plods along through the years. All in all another film which is very over rated. Anderson's first feature HARD EIGHT is far better value for money, and is there really a need for that final scene?

For the first 40 minutes or so I was actually quite intrigued with the story of a young bus boy (Mark Wahlberg) who meets a top porn film director (Burt Reynolds) who sets out to make him a star in the seedy world of pornography, drugs and disco. The problem is that after 40 minutes the story takes a nose dive and the result is a total mess. From then on you have to sit through over 2 hours of total mishmash as Wahlberg and Reynolds get more irritating by the minute.

However, this sequel which was released three years later, is a very worthy follow up. It is just as suspenseful a movie, and should be applauded for NOT just copying the first one - I actually find it quite distressing, particularly in the scene where the kindly Marge is rescuing little Sean Brody. Roy Scheider, Lorraine Gary and Murray Hamilton all reprise their original roles will ease, and there is a terrific performance from Ann Dusenberry as Tina Wilcox (how on earth did Ms. Dusenberry NOT become a major star?!). Well worth seeing, but be warned - keep your fingers in your ears whenever Jackie (Donna Wilkes) appears onscreen!

It was a masterpiece of it's time and still is today!  It's uniqueness and creativity is something film makers have been wanting to accomplish since it's release. Orson Welles, dubbed the Boy Genius really proves his talents in this. He's incredible as the part of Charles Foster Kane...a power-hungry leader.

Instead we get non-funny Rosie O'Donnell saying the dumbest one-liners I have heard in film history.  Who thinks this woman is funny? I would rather stare at a blank wall than have to watch another Rosie O'Donnell flick. Please Rosie,  have mercy on us and make no more movies and stay on your talk show that no one watches.
