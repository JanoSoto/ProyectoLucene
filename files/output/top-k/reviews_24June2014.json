I remember I used to rent this movie a lot at our local convenient store that rented movies down the road from us as a kid. I was even in a play of the movie in the 3rd Grade, I played a blue Oompa Loompa, but I was really shy back then so I didn't try out for one of the bigger roles.Anyway I still love to watch this movie even today from time to time, and it's still as great as I remember it to be, maybe even better. What I love most about this movie is Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka. This is the first Gene Wilder movie that I saw and became a fan of his after watching his performance. He is the best Willy Wonka in my opinion. You never knew what he was thinking or what he was going to do next, in fact, Willy Wonka's first entrance was actually Gene Wilder's idea and the reason he decided to do the movie, which is brilliant. As for the other performances, I thought Peter Ostrum did a great job as Charlie, for this being his first and only film role. Jack Albertson was great as Grandpa Joe as well.The songs I actually don't mind all that much in the movie, and I don't think they are a distraction. I think the songs are catchy and timeless, my favorite song has to be Pure Imagination.My only complaints about this movie are kind of small nitpicks like how they don't talk about that crazy boat ride ever again or how we don't know what happened to the rest of the kids in the end, unless they meant for that to be unexplained.Overall this movie is just classic and very enjoyable with great music, set designs, as well as great performances, and funny moments. I highly recommend this movie to really anybody, it's a timeless classic that can be enjoyed by anyone at any age, this movie is simply pure imagination.

I hope you people don't get mad at me for such ignorance. I don't know much of what was going on in 1988-- in fact, I wasn't even born--, so that's why I didn't know this movie's recognition. Tom Cruise's character (Charlie) is an arrogant, ambitious and selfish boy who finds out he has a savant brother who inherit all their father's money. From that point on, Charlie tries everything to get the custody of his brother, in order to be able to manage his fortune. Not only that, but Charlie is extremely rude with his poor brother, and I felt like punching Charlie in almost every scene. There is nothing wrong with acting from anyone from the cast; Hoffman, Cruise and Golino are decent in what they're doing. The big problem is the weak directing. Barry Levinson builds only normal scenes that never engage the movie as a whole, so I never got to see a dramatic moment in the whole picture. Also, the kissing scene between Raymond and Susana didn't feel right by any standards for me. Maybe the only really interesting scene happened when Charlie and Raymond had a conversation with the doctors, in the last 10 minutes, but it feels too hard to track the slow-paced story that filmmakers have given. Rain Man proves to be very passable, in my point of view. I hope fans don't get me wrong.

That's the films concept. And on the strength of Silver Streak, and Stir Crazy, the studio took a gamble on offending a lot of people.Somewhere in the film there is a story about a murder and the two witnessing it, but then they become suspects in the murder, and the cops are after them, and a pre fame Keving Spacey is after them too (you can tell he's pre fame, because he has his unsightly growth).Throw in a beauty of an eighties soundtrack, and a joke about being blind or deaf every five minutes, then serve with a huge slice of cheese.....From what you've just read, you'd expect me to despise the film, but it was released when I was twelve, and it was silly and profane enough to demand repeat viewings, so its a bit of a guilty pleasure for me.What is unique is that the film could never be remade, because Hollywood is way to PC to even chance a film like this, look at Mr. Magoo, the risible Nielsen film, and read the disclaimer that film carried. 16 years ago, they were worrying about upsetting people with a kids movie.Pryor and Wilder still have that wonderful chemistry together, and every scene they share is comedy gold, but it's the rest of the film that really lets it down. It's just too perfunctory and bland to keep up with the leads, so come the end, it's as if everyone else has given up and just let the two take over.The comedy is stupid and very derogatory, but at the end of the day, it's the cinematic equivalent of watching an old lady fall over.
