Frances McDormand stars as Marge Gunderson, a pregnant police chief whose affable, folksy demeanor masks a whip-smart mind. When a pair of motorists are found slain not far from the corpse of a state trooper, Marge begins piecing together a case involving a pair of dopey would-be kidnappers, Carl (Steve Buscemi) and Gaear (Bergman stock player Peter Stormare). They've been hired by Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy), a car salesman under the thumb of his wealthy, overbearing boss and father-in-law, Wade (Harve Presnell). Jerry's raised some money illegally through a petty scam he's run on General Motors and he's about to get caught. When Wade sours a business deal that could save his son- in-law's hide, the desperate Jerry hires Carl and Gaear to kidnap his wife and hold her for ransom. Things go predictably wrong and a series of murders occur, with Marge, waddling along behind her enormous belly and ever-hungering for an all-you-can-eat buffet, hot on the trail of the killers.

That version at least had developed characters, remarkable imagery, and a strong storyline that was greatly enhanced and deepened by clarified character relationships and a rich historical context. George Stevens did The Greatest Story Ever Told, however, just to be seen doing it. As opposed to the more extrovert Biblical spectacles (think The Robe, The Ten Commandments, and King of Kings, all great or near-great movies) this one focuses less on the pageantry and more on the human drama-- or, at least, that was the plan. But it failed for a number of reasons.1) Movies set in the historical past (and, by the way, the future) are inherently showy because they require showy sets and costumes. In spite of Stevens' intent, it's still a bunch of ancient designs on a super-wide (too wide) screen. 2) The movie is cluttered (as you well know) with tacky cameo appearances ranging from the understandable (Roddy McDowell as an apostle, Sal Mineo as a cripple) to the absurd (Shelley Winters) and the downright obscene (show me John Wayne!) Even this would be understandable, however, if the characters had any sort of depth. The only character who is truly explored to the fullest potential is Jesus. More on this in a minute. 3) Stevens seems to lean far too strongly on his artistic homages. Using DaVinci's staging of the last supper (all on one side of the table!) is forgivable, but the slightly altered version of the Sistine chapel featured at the beginning is a bit much, and he lost me completely when two of the giant miracles (one at the beginning, one at the end) were underscored by the Hallelujah chorus from Handel's Messiah, which clashes drastically with Alfred Newman's gloriously powerful (though not very ambitious) score. Newman valiantly wrote his own Hallelujahs to make for a less awkward transition into the Handel music, but it's still jarringly familiar.Max von Sydow delivers one of his truly great performances as Christ-- quiet when necessary but always full of grandeur and solemnity. He outdoes Jeffrey Hunter (King of Kings) every step of the way. And Charlton Heston makes a compelling John the Baptist-- but our connection to the character of John is that of watching and hearing a great orator deliver speeches we've all heard millions of times before. It's like, for instance, Barack Obama delivering the I Have a Dream speech. I'm sure it's a wonderful performance, but it doesn't offer any psychological insight into the man who originated it. It is, in fact, just one man temporarily inhabiting the persona of, never actually evoking, a rare mind. The worst of all in the film's voluminous list of disappointingly flat characterizations is David McCallum's Judas (for which I don't blame McCallum, but Stevens and his co-screenwriter James Lee Barrett). As is often the trap, Judas is given absolutely no discernible motivation for that certain deed of his. When he enacts it, we knew it was coming but we still feel completely and totally blindsided. And shallowly so. How can you feel pity for people who exist only to adhere to a millennia-old story as familiar as your own hometown?The film as it exists today is presented in a 199-minute version with 45 seconds of overture and nearly six minutes of intermission and exit music. It was originally 225 minutes (!). King of Kings runs 171 minutes with 3 minutes of overture and about six minutes of intermission and exit music. They both tell the same story but only King of Kings resembles any sort of dramatically valid presentation. Greatest Story Ever Told fails to achieve in 199 what King of Kings excelled at in 171. Of course, Greatest is still closer to the subject matter-- but only because of its slavish script, stilted dialogue (which uncomfortably fuses Jacobean grandiloquence with contemporary Sunday school jargon) and artistic self-indulgence.

","genre":"Biography, Drama, History"},{"date":"8 July 2011","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" Fight Club's tagline is probably one of my favorites and boasts a great question in the world today; how much can you know about yourself if you've never been in a fight? Never being in a true fight, I suppose I, myself, and a lot of others don't know their physical strength, their limitations, and abilities under the given circumstances in a real scuffle. When will you call uncle? When will the anger consume you? When will you bleed out? Let's not talk about it.Being requested by many people to watch this film, why I put it off is something I can't answer. I believe it was because I feared since the film is filled with morals and very subtle messages I would not get most of it. Out of the countless number of morals Fight Club spat at me, I took two and would like to share them.The number one thing I took out of Fight Club is that men have become sort of softies in the world we live in, and many no longer sport the tough as nails image women mistake us for. Here we have an insomniac who loses direction in life, becomes what some will call insane, and escapes to an underground fighting club where men beat the living hell out of each other for absolutely no reason, no questions asked. I think it's because beating each other to a pulp makes them feel like they still sport this image, and that they haven't gotten soft. They can take a lot of damage, unnecessary and necessary.The other thing is sometimes the worst enemy can be your best friend or yourself. Writing a spoiler free review of this film is difficult, and explaining this moral without stating an example is hard as well. I really don't want to give anything away just to explain the moral I picked up, so I won't. Just go into the movie with that in the back of your mind.On with the plot, our main character, also the narrator, is played by Edward Norton. He remains nameless throughout the entire film, and works as an automobile company employee. He suffers from serve insomnia, often having trouble dictating what is real and what is fake. Director David Fincher describes his character as an everyman. To cope with his insomnia, and forbidden any sort of treatment from his doctor, the man continues to visit support groups. He does this to feel better about himself, and to witness others with more serve problems. He is an impostor at every one of these groups, and creates a fake name for each.Another impostor attends these groups named Marla Singer (Bonham Carter) much to the dismay of our narrator. They talk to each other and work out a deal so that their presences at these groups don't coincide with one another.On a flight home from a meeting, the narrator meets Tyler Durden (Pitt), a soap salesman. They talk at a bar after the narrator returns home to find his apartment in flames, and Tyler forces the narrator to punch him. They continue to fight in the back of this bar, with more people arriving everyday. They soon find a basement in a building they can use and establish their own Fight Club to get away from society's troubles.Fight Club is scored very well, and its cinematography is beautiful. Why no Oscar nominations for the much deserved Norton and Pitt? Because of the film's extreme marketing. Disappointing in the field of criticism and revenue, Fight Club's trailers looked as if it were a film about a bunch of people beating the hell out of each other for no reason besides personal satisfaction. There is a market for those movies, but I'm pretty sure unless having read the novel of the same name by Chuck Palahniuk or reading up on the internet about this movie, people who went to go see it, were likely, not aware they were seeing a very smart and beautifully crafted film.Sadly, I was mislead upon watching this movie. So many people, including friends and reviewers on various movie sites, described the film as life changing and many said it changes one's view of movies forever. It did none of that for me. It entertained me, and some moments I couldn't look away. Even at the most grisly times, Fight Club remains classy and stylistic. But it is no way life changing.But I can totally see how it did for some people. Some people enjoy the occasional mind-rape style of filmmaking, a style that Fincher is very good at. They love making assumptions, hunches, and usually use large amounts of evidence gained from repeated viewings of some movies. Even video games like The Legend of Zelda have caused a legion of fans to take the world of the game very seriously. I don't have the time to do this, especially to this particular film. I can't see myself enjoying it more and more with repeated viewings. It was very enjoyable the first time around, but I feel the more I watch it the less surprised I'll be at certain events in the film that stunned me (IE the scene with Lou).The on character relationship between Norton and Pitt is excellent, and can't be replaced at all. The various morals in the film are very well crafted and the movie tackles more genres than one may expect. It's a lot like Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange.

Never being in a true fight, I suppose I, myself, and a lot of others don't know their physical strength, their limitations, and abilities under the given circumstances in a real scuffle. When will you call uncle? When will the anger consume you? When will you bleed out? Let's not talk about it.Being requested by many people to watch this film, why I put it off is something I can't answer. I believe it was because I feared since the film is filled with morals and very subtle messages I would not get most of it. Out of the countless number of morals Fight Club spat at me, I took two and would like to share them.The number one thing I took out of Fight Club is that men have become sort of softies in the world we live in, and many no longer sport the tough as nails image women mistake us for. Here we have an insomniac who loses direction in life, becomes what some will call insane, and escapes to an underground fighting club where men beat the living hell out of each other for absolutely no reason, no questions asked. I think it's because beating each other to a pulp makes them feel like they still sport this image, and that they haven't gotten soft. They can take a lot of damage, unnecessary and necessary.The other thing is sometimes the worst enemy can be your best friend or yourself. Writing a spoiler free review of this film is difficult, and explaining this moral without stating an example is hard as well. I really don't want to give anything away just to explain the moral I picked up, so I won't. Just go into the movie with that in the back of your mind.On with the plot, our main character, also the narrator, is played by Edward Norton. He remains nameless throughout the entire film, and works as an automobile company employee. He suffers from serve insomnia, often having trouble dictating what is real and what is fake. Director David Fincher describes his character as an everyman. To cope with his insomnia, and forbidden any sort of treatment from his doctor, the man continues to visit support groups. He does this to feel better about himself, and to witness others with more serve problems. He is an impostor at every one of these groups, and creates a fake name for each.Another impostor attends these groups named Marla Singer (Bonham Carter) much to the dismay of our narrator. They talk to each other and work out a deal so that their presences at these groups don't coincide with one another.On a flight home from a meeting, the narrator meets Tyler Durden (Pitt), a soap salesman. They talk at a bar after the narrator returns home to find his apartment in flames, and Tyler forces the narrator to punch him. They continue to fight in the back of this bar, with more people arriving everyday. They soon find a basement in a building they can use and establish their own Fight Club to get away from society's troubles.Fight Club is scored very well, and its cinematography is beautiful. Why no Oscar nominations for the much deserved Norton and Pitt? Because of the film's extreme marketing. Disappointing in the field of criticism and revenue, Fight Club's trailers looked as if it were a film about a bunch of people beating the hell out of each other for no reason besides personal satisfaction. There is a market for those movies, but I'm pretty sure unless having read the novel of the same name by Chuck Palahniuk or reading up on the internet about this movie, people who went to go see it, were likely, not aware they were seeing a very smart and beautifully crafted film.Sadly, I was mislead upon watching this movie. So many people, including friends and reviewers on various movie sites, described the film as life changing and many said it changes one's view of movies forever. It did none of that for me. It entertained me, and some moments I couldn't look away. Even at the most grisly times, Fight Club remains classy and stylistic. But it is no way life changing.But I can totally see how it did for some people. Some people enjoy the occasional mind-rape style of filmmaking, a style that Fincher is very good at. They love making assumptions, hunches, and usually use large amounts of evidence gained from repeated viewings of some movies. Even video games like The Legend of Zelda have caused a legion of fans to take the world of the game very seriously. I don't have the time to do this, especially to this particular film. I can't see myself enjoying it more and more with repeated viewings. It was very enjoyable the first time around, but I feel the more I watch it the less surprised I'll be at certain events in the film that stunned me (IE the scene with Lou).The on character relationship between Norton and Pitt is excellent, and can't be replaced at all. The various morals in the film are very well crafted and the movie tackles more genres than one may expect. It's a lot like Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange. Critics deemed it dark when it first came out, but lived on to become a classic. Fight Club took the same route.

It's horrific and you know where it is leading. Manhunter marks the very first appearance of Hannibal Lecter, only here he isn't played by Anthony Hopkins. Brian Cox plays the sly psychopath as he helps FBI Agent Will Graham to hunt down an elusive killer nicknamed The Tooth Fairy. This gruesome murderer seems to pick his targets at random and Graham hopes that Lecter will be able to help pinpoint The Tooth Fairy's pattern. But you can't exactly trust a serial killer so Lecter causes even more problems for Graham, making his chase all the more thrilling and dangerous.I have a very keen interest in serial killer films so I was guaranteed to like this movie from the start. This is a step by step serial killer flick that also captures the dark depravity of the psychopathic mind spot on. It tells a thrilling and disturbing story from start to finish that builds suspense so well. The film isn't even told from just one perspective. At times we see the film from Graham's position as he hunts down the killer, trying desperately to get into his mind and decipher the killer's motives. Then a large portion of the movie is from the killer's point of view where we get to see the darkly twisted motives that drive this creature to insanity. It makes the film human on both ends of the spectrum while also building a narrative that flows and builds very well.But what's really fun about Manhunter is just how timely it is. This film doesn't try at all to convince you it wasn't made in the mid 1980's. It's got all the music and style that fits so well for that time period. A lot of it can be conceived as cheesy but I find it to be a lot of fun and give the film a wildly entertaining mood. Plus, I didn't find this film unsatisfactory in the thrill department. It manages to be very creepy and very suspenseful, even amidst some of the 80's cheese. The style of the film is very 80's but it's also very Michael Mann. Mann directs the film with a lot of haunting precision. It is a very well shot film that elicits fear and anguish pretty easily. Mann does a great job at creating a film that is both terrifying and interesting.Manhunter is a different film but it is very good. It is disturbing but in a more subtle and haunting way.

The thing that gives the story any sense of real exercised life is the Critters - even them, the Creatures like in Gremlins are the ones that we can identify with - come on they're omnivores looking for a bite to eat; they are so terrible at getting it that we just wished everything was inexorable. The first kill was of a police officer who was eaten through unknown means - we know who killed him, but it was the way it was done that seemed enticing, and then we realized that this movie is not going for the route of body counts that happen in fast and furious ways (which albeit I love suspense, but the movie would have been better as a schlocky movie in that sense, and not a stale and mind numbing movie, only proving it's schlocky at suspense), but it is not even set up with natural consequences.

Jacob's Ladder is about Jacob Singer, a Vietnam war veteran who can't cope with life back at home. He has demonic visions that slowly convince him he is descending into Hell. He desperately searches for answers but is only delivered more questions as he tries to find out why these horrific things are happening to him. The film twists and turns as it spirals down a dark path towards insanity. While watching this film you can never be too sure of what is real and what is hallucination. Reality is blurred to hellish extremes in this film, making it a disturbing yet fascinating experience.Jacob's Ladder begins interestingly enough. It is a little odd and you are sort of just dragged along as the character of Jacob Singer is introduced. We learn that Jacob has a girlfriend but he was once married. He had three kids with his ex-wife, one of which died in an accident. The film jumps back and forth between Vietnam and present day while strange little things begin to happen. Jacob has very odd visions that have a subtle creep factor to them that starts off the mood of the film very well. The film has excellent pacing and it builds very well. The visions become more and more terrifying as things start to come together. And when I say come together I use the term very loosely. We think the film makes more and more sense as it goes along, but everything we piece together we see through the veil of the unreliable narrator. You really can't discern what is real and what isn't. There is mystery in everything and we have no real way of knowing what is actually happening. We are pushed along through this maze with Jacob, making the experience as frightening and confusing for us as it is for him. Jacob's Ladder is almost more of an experience than a film.This movie puts you in a kind of trance. I was hypnotized by the film and I didn't even realize it until the film ended. It was a very odd experience because this film really got into my head, forcing me to watch with unmoving bewilderment. But when the film ended and I came out of the trance I wasn't entirely sure what I had just sat through. I was more focused on piecing together that experience rather than forming an opinion on the film itself. I'm honestly not sure what I thought about this movie. What I do know is that it had some sort of affect on me and for that I can consider it to be a very good film. The whole film captures that dream like quality so well, only it is more of a nightmare quality. The film sets out to be a story of existential terror and it achieves that so I can say that this is a great film just based on the more straightforward opinions I did form about the film.Jacob's Ladder is like a puzzle. You start with all the individual pieces that make no sense apart but when put together they begin to make some sort of sense. You slowly piece together this puzzle, jumping around and finding matches here and there, drawing connections and having things start to come into focus little by little. And then after fighting through this puzzle you almost piece together everything and as things start to make sense the table is flipped and the puzzle comes crashing to the floor, shattering into all its individual pieces once again. Then you look through the wreckage and realize that all the answers were there from the start before you ever started piecing things together. And yet you are still haunted by this puzzle and you will be no matter what. You would have to see the film to understand these ramblings of mine so go see it. It is an excellent film.

As Travis sees much of the city during his late hours and longs shifts, he becomes disgusted with the 'scum' that live and operate in it. This provokes Travis' to commit a violent act and he is driven to the edge of sanity. He plots to assassinate a senator and rescue a young prostitute.ReviewOnly truly special films win the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival and 'Taxi Driver' is without doubt a truly special film.De Niro's performance and portrayal of Travis is frighteningly realistic, I had to keep reassuring myself that it was De Niro and not some nut job taxi driver that Scorsese had simply went out and found. We will watch in awe as he portrays a man who puts his words into actions and responds to the 'scum' who feed his need for violence. De Niro pulls out all the stops to give a spectacular and disturbing performance and one that will live long in the memory. The character Travis Bickle is without a doubt one of the most amazing, interesting characters ever to grace cinema. Travis as a character will leave you speechless. He has 'bad ideas' that are revealed to the audience more as the film progresses, he gradually becomes obsessed with killing Senator Pallantyne and saving a a young prostitute. His increasingly worrying diary entries point to the direction of violence, which prepares the audience for something significant and presents an imminent danger. But its the little things about Travis that will stay in your mind, his tough guy persona when he's alone with his gun, and his memorable lines such as 'You Talking To Me!'. Sure we know Travis is a strange person from the beginning as he doesn't seem to visit a porn cinema for pleasure and he speaks rather openly to Betsy on their first date, referring to the 'connection' between the two although they have just met. However we overlook this due to his likability, as does Betsy. We see though that his fantasies become realities, somewhat unsurprisingly however as Travis speaks early on about his desire to 'clean up the scum' and as we watch his actions during the climax, we know that Travis go down as one of the greatest characters in cinematic history.The film is about isolation in a society full of wrongdoings and crime. Travis is a very lonely and isolated character and we learn this from the beginning of the film. His only attempt to achieve company goes to no avail as he takes Betsy to a porn film and she is appalled, further strengthening a viewers perception that Travis is detached from society and the 'scum' that are a part of it, he lives amongst his fantasies of violence and we learn early on that he is a troubled and unstable individual, however his attempt to achieve a form of stability and company through Betsy collapses and Travis tells her 'you're in hell, and you're gonna die in hell like the rest of em' this 'hell' as he calls it is simply society, and the isolation of himself from this city of 'scum'. He sees Betsy as something different at first, but then he views her in the same light as everyone else after she doesn't take his calls for quite obvious and understandable reasons. This could be seen as Travis living in a fantasy world rather than real life, and his loneliness is fuelled by his detachment from real life, his perception of the city may be because he does not view everyone in his own image although Travis is far from perfect and we see this in many instances in the film hence the reason Travis could be seen as responsible for his own loneliness and isolation. However the fact that Travis puts his words into actions may disclaim this and show that he is the anti- hero of the film who is an anomaly in a distasteful city and his loneliness is in fact understandable and Travis Bickle may be misunderstood by many, by saving Iris this presents Travis as different to the rest, he tries to stand up and be counted for at the end of the film and could be viewed as the good guy who uses 'true force' to revolt against a differing city. Is Travis to blame for his isolation and detachment? it is debatable but the themes of loneliness, detachment and isolation are a significant inclusion by Scorsese and Schrader's script certainly highlights these debatable but fascinating themes.The film is expertly executed and some of the inclusions and scenes are amazingly directed. The music by Bernard Herrmann that plays during the start of the film is seductive but has a catastrophic quality and Scorsese's choice of cinematographer Michael Chapmann is also ideal, his lighting and camera choices contribute towards a brilliant film. Scorsese has perfected the memorable scenes, Travis standing in front of the mirror trying out his guns, Travis bursting into the brothel bearing a psychotic grin and wielding handguns subsequently massacring pimps and clients. The way Scorsese has used dialogue creates moods that are fascinating for a watching audience. The fact that Scorsese brought in De Niro earns merit, he tops off a complete trio of Schrader, Scorsese and De Niro that works perfectly together.Summary 'Taxi Driver' is one of those films that will stay with you forever, its something truly special. The all round fantastic acting, the directors inclusions and Schrader's script make an all round sublime film that you will never forget. Simply stunning!

His only attempt to achieve company goes to no avail as he takes Betsy to a porn film and she is appalled, further strengthening a viewers perception that Travis is detached from society and the 'scum' that are a part of it, he lives amongst his fantasies of violence and we learn early on that he is a troubled and unstable individual, however his attempt to achieve a form of stability and company through Betsy collapses and Travis tells her 'you're in hell, and you're gonna die in hell like the rest of em' this 'hell' as he calls it is simply society, and the isolation of himself from this city of 'scum'. He sees Betsy as something different at first, but then he views her in the same light as everyone else after she doesn't take his calls for quite obvious and understandable reasons. This could be seen as Travis living in a fantasy world rather than real life, and his loneliness is fuelled by his detachment from real life, his perception of the city may be because he does not view everyone in his own image although Travis is far from perfect and we see this in many instances in the film hence the reason Travis could be seen as responsible for his own loneliness and isolation. However the fact that Travis puts his words into actions may disclaim this and show that he is the anti- hero of the film who is an anomaly in a distasteful city and his loneliness is in fact understandable and Travis Bickle may be misunderstood by many, by saving Iris this presents Travis as different to the rest, he tries to stand up and be counted for at the end of the film and could be viewed as the good guy who uses 'true force' to revolt against a differing city. Is Travis to blame for his isolation and detachment? it is debatable but the themes of loneliness, detachment and isolation are a significant inclusion by Scorsese and Schrader's script certainly highlights these debatable but fascinating themes.The film is expertly executed and some of the inclusions and scenes are amazingly directed. The music by Bernard Herrmann that plays during the start of the film is seductive but has a catastrophic quality and Scorsese's choice of cinematographer Michael Chapmann is also ideal, his lighting and camera choices contribute towards a brilliant film. Scorsese has perfected the memorable scenes, Travis standing in front of the mirror trying out his guns, Travis bursting into the brothel bearing a psychotic grin and wielding handguns subsequently massacring pimps and clients. The way Scorsese has used dialogue creates moods that are fascinating for a watching audience. The fact that Scorsese brought in De Niro earns merit, he tops off a complete trio of Schrader, Scorsese and De Niro that works perfectly together.Summary 'Taxi Driver' is one of those films that will stay with you forever, its something truly special. The all round fantastic acting, the directors inclusions and Schrader's script make an all round sublime film that you will never forget. Simply stunning!

As Travis sees much of the city during his late hours and longs shifts, he becomes disgusted with the 'scum' that live and operate in it. This provokes Travis' to commit a violent act and he is driven to the edge of sanity. He plots to assassinate a senator and rescue a young prostitute.ReviewOnly truly special films win the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival and 'Taxi Driver' is without doubt a truly special film.De Niro's performance and portrayal of Travis is frighteningly realistic, I had to keep reassuring myself that it was De Niro and not some nut job taxi driver that Scorsese had simply went out and found. We will watch in awe as he portrays a man who puts his words into actions and responds to the 'scum' who feed his need for violence. De Niro pulls out all the stops to give a spectacular and disturbing performance and one that will live long in the memory. The character Travis Bickle is without a doubt one of the most amazing, interesting characters ever to grace cinema. Travis as a character will leave you speechless. He has 'bad ideas' that are revealed to the audience more as the film progresses, he gradually becomes obsessed with killing Senator Pallantyne and saving a a young prostitute. His increasingly worrying diary entries point to the direction of violence, which prepares the audience for something significant and presents an imminent danger. But its the little things about Travis that will stay in your mind, his tough guy persona when he's alone with his gun, and his memorable lines such as 'You Talking To Me!'. Sure we know Travis is a strange person from the beginning as he doesn't seem to visit a porn cinema for pleasure and he speaks rather openly to Betsy on their first date, referring to the 'connection' between the two although they have just met. However we overlook this due to his likability, as does Betsy. We see though that his fantasies become realities, somewhat unsurprisingly however as Travis speaks early on about his desire to 'clean up the scum' and as we watch his actions during the climax, we know that Travis go down as one of the greatest characters in cinematic history.The film is about isolation in a society full of wrongdoings and crime.

That's what I like to call a film like Mimic. It's when a great visionary, Guillermo del Toro in this case, misses the mark and delivers us a flop. The ironic thing is that del Toro will admit that Mimic is his dud. He disowned this film out of shame for what it became. It was a film that got away from him and was left to the studio to ruin with their revised endings and watered down script. Guillermo del Toro is a passionate director who loves art and loves film, so more than anything I just feel sorry for him that his project escaped him and became something he resents. I suppose that is just the Hollywood way, as sad as it is.But moving on from the sad, sad tale of a man betrayed, Mimic is a sci-fi horror film about giant bugs trying to eliminate the one threat they have left, mankind. The film begins three years before present day when Dr. Susan Tyler created the Judas bug to kill off cockroaches carrying a virus that was killing children. The Judas bug was a complete success and in a way Susan saved the world. Jump ahead three years and the Judas bug as evolved into some kind of monster, adapting to the world and becoming eerily human like. It's up to Susan, her husband, and an angry black security guard to stop this exoskeletal threat.What surprised me about this film is that it is actually pretty boring. The setup is slow and dull and all the build up to the final battle against the bugs is surprisingly lackluster. I can't call this film incredibly intelligent. It has a decent storyline that sort of flat lines after setting the stage for what the film will be about. It has a dull script and sub-par actors that don't carry the film well. The first two thirds of the film just seem to amble along at a pretty dead pace, never exploding and never really grabbing hold of my attention. Things just sort of happen. They don't elicit any emotion and nothing in the beginning made me go, Wow. That was creative. For the first two acts of the film Mimic is sort of just there.The film really picks up in the last act though. The end of the film takes place in an abandoned subway station where the bugs are nesting and building their numbers. This dark and eerie set piece is the perfect place for a thrilling ending to the film. del Toro directs with a textured and visceral quality. He really knows how to capture thrills and he structures the final act of Mimic very well. There are some great moments in the mysteriously spooky underground that do well to satisfy an appetite for awesome bug versus man action. There are also numerous moments of shining creativity that remind me that I am watching a del Toro film. Those subway scenes are wonderfully imaginative and they exemplify why this is a del Toro film. It is everything else that runs awry and makes me think I'm watching another cheese eaten sci-fi from some no name Hollywood hack.I was prepared to call Mimic a so-so film that could have been a lot better. I was ready to finish out my thoughts on the movie by saying that this is a film that shines in some areas and lacks in others. I was prepared to say that it wasn't terrible, but it was certainly no masterpiece. Then the ending came along. The final two shots of the film filled me with so much frustration and aggravation that I had to resolve my opinion and call this a bad film. There were enough redeeming qualities for me to call this a decent film, but then it had to go and ruin it all with the stupidest ending imaginable. I couldn't believe it and I couldn't continue to call this a good film. It is a disappointment, overall, with only a few good things going for it.

It depicts the tragedy of isolation in the middle of a hostile and selfish environment while providing some of the most sumptuous comedic moments you'll ever see in a film. It's the perfect marriage between slapstick, and social commentary under a nuptial humanism. And one other thing, the movie gets better after each viewing. What strikes the most when you watch The Gold Rush, and being an avid admirer of Charlie Chaplin sure helps, is the completeness of the film, it delivers exactly what you'd expect, to use a dated cliché, you'll laugh, you'll cry, but with an extra  that for every tear you'll get a comedic twist, and whenever you feel like you need to catch your breath, a scene will come that would remind you that there's no powerful comedy without a good amount of drama. And The Gold Rush, considering, how it's put early in the chronological map of Chaplin's filmography, contains more dramatic elements than usual, counterbalancing the laughs from the slapstick, but with more cinematic maturity. The movie is set in the Klondike during the famous Gold Rush where men were conquering the mountain and their fears for some gold nuggets that would change their life, ultimately most of them would find rocks and disappointment, or lead, if the cold and the mountain didn't kill them. The setting is the first element that makes this movie particularly memorable, no policemen, no bourgeois, not the usual urban setting where Chaplin is the Tramp. In The Gold Rush, we have the mountain, the beautiful summits painted with a blinding white, where every step could be the last, where the blizzard blows the big like the small with a fair mercilessness, a hostility the Tramp used to endure before &#x85; except that he's not the Tramp anymore&#x85; but the Little Fellow&#x85; in a desert of snow.In his quest, the Little Fellow will make enemies and friends through a gallery of unforgettable characters. And this is another relevant aspect of what I called 'cinematic maturity', the characters don't serve as foils to Chaplin, but they have their own background and personality, and for the first time, there's an appealing male character besides the Tramp, when it's usually him and the girl. When we talk about The Gold Rush, we see Big Jim, the good-hearted burly prospector who found a mountain of gold and Black Larsen, as probably the most cold-blooded character in any Chaplin's film. For the first time, we got a real villain, with no fake eyebrows or mustaches, this one looks really menacing and don't hesitate to use his weapons. Another revolutionary aspect is the visual effects. While Chaplin's humor most often relies on slapstick and visual humor, here we have an avalanche (sorry for the bad pun) of spectacular comical effects that would set a lesson the fans of Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd. The blizzard scene must have used a particular trick to make the sliding effect so believable, also the scene where the cabin is teetering on the edge of a mountain, or when Black Larsen gets his comeuppance. There's a sense of meticulousness that confirms Chaplin's abilities as a film-maker. The spectacular visual effects have nothing to envy from the same-year released Battleship Potemkin. There's no Chaplin's movie without a romance but here again, Chaplin manages to surprise us, by providing an astonishingly modern female character through Georgia, a saloon girl who developed a genuine fondness on the Little Fellow, but to say that she's in love would be a stretch. She uses him, to make her lover jealous, she teases him, and even snubs him during the New Year's Eve date. The Edna Purnivace period is over, we're far from the melodramatic romance or the passive female character. Georgia's got a personality that remarkably contrasts with Chaplin's tenderness, and confirms that sometimes, the coldness of the mountains is easier to tolerate than the heart's. She will eventually regret her act after having hurt the Little Fellow's feelings.The story of The Gold Rush is a gripping and exhilarating journey through the conquest of mountain and hearts and find gold in both.. There's the heart of brave men beating inside, and this is the inspirational aspect that completes the film. It tells us a story, with memorable characters, a mature romance, great special effects, and a succession of iconic moments forever engraved in our memories. From where can I start? The iconic shoe eating scenes, a scene that had to be rehearsed more than 60 times to satisfy the perfectionism of Chaplin, the hallucination scene, The Little Fellow's frenetic joy when he got a date and during a vision of that very date, the scene that would define the film, the bread rolls dance, an image forever associated with Charlie Chaplin, and that would be parodied in many other films. The Gold Rush is Chaplin's confirmation of what The Kid implied, and that the following films would never disappoint.Finally, I'm glad I had the chance to watch the version with Chaplin's narration as it certainly gave more life to the film, and even if I could have understood the story, it sure gave an idea of the actors' pantomime talent. Chaplin's voice provided a comforting presence in a film that needed that while the beautiful music embodied the mix of sad sweetness and tender love that inhabits Chaplin's heart of gold, before he finally found it with Big Jim.I said the film was mature, not quite. There was like a sort of plot twist when The Rich Little Fellow put his old clothes as I thought a misunderstanding would get him off the boat, but no, he met Georgia who finally went with him. Yes, it was an unexpected fairy-tale happy ending, but after all the hardship he endured, The Little Fellow needed a break.

","genre":"Adventure, Comedy, Drama"},{"date":"8 July 2011","score":"","review":" The Gold Rush is the quintessential Chaplin film in many aspects. It depicts the tragedy of isolation in the middle of a hostile and selfish environment while providing some of the most sumptuous comedic moments you'll ever see in a film. It's the perfect marriage between slapstick, and social commentary under a nuptial humanism. And one other thing, the movie gets better after each viewing. What strikes the most when you watch The Gold Rush, and being an avid admirer of Charlie Chaplin sure helps, is the completeness of the film, it delivers exactly what you'd expect, to use a dated cliché, you'll laugh, you'll cry, but with an extra  that for every tear you'll get a comedic twist, and whenever you feel like you need to catch your breath, a scene will come that would remind you that there's no powerful comedy without a good amount of drama. And The Gold Rush, considering, how it's put early in the chronological map of Chaplin's filmography, contains more dramatic elements than usual, counterbalancing the laughs from the slapstick, but with more cinematic maturity. The movie is set in the Klondike during the famous Gold Rush where men were conquering the mountain and their fears for some gold nuggets that would change their life, ultimately most of them would find rocks and disappointment, or lead, if the cold and the mountain didn't kill them. The setting is the first element that makes this movie particularly memorable, no policemen, no bourgeois, not the usual urban setting where Chaplin is the Tramp. In The Gold Rush, we have the mountain, the beautiful summits painted with a blinding white, where every step could be the last, where the blizzard blows the big like the small with a fair mercilessness, a hostility the Tramp used to endure before &#x85; except that he's not the Tramp anymore&#x85; but the Little Fellow&#x85; in a desert of snow.In his quest, the Little Fellow will make enemies and friends through a gallery of unforgettable characters. And this is another relevant aspect of what I called 'cinematic maturity', the characters don't serve as foils to Chaplin, but they have their own background and personality, and for the first time, there's an appealing male character besides the Tramp, when it's usually him and the girl. When we talk about The Gold Rush, we see Big Jim, the good-hearted burly prospector who found a mountain of gold and Black Larsen, as probably the most cold-blooded character in any Chaplin's film. For the first time, we got a real villain, with no fake eyebrows or mustaches, this one looks really menacing and don't hesitate to use his weapons. Another revolutionary aspect is the visual effects. While Chaplin's humor most often relies on slapstick and visual humor, here we have an avalanche (sorry for the bad pun) of spectacular comical effects that would set a lesson the fans of Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd. The blizzard scene must have used a particular trick to make the sliding effect so believable, also the scene where the cabin is teetering on the edge of a mountain, or when Black Larsen gets his comeuppance. There's a sense of meticulousness that confirms Chaplin's abilities as a film-maker. The spectacular visual effects have nothing to envy from the same-year released Battleship Potemkin. There's no Chaplin's movie without a romance but here again, Chaplin manages to surprise us, by providing an astonishingly modern female character through Georgia, a saloon girl who developed a genuine fondness on the Little Fellow, but to say that she's in love would be a stretch. She uses him, to make her lover jealous, she teases him, and even snubs him during the New Year's Eve date. The Edna Purnivace period is over, we're far from the melodramatic romance or the passive female character. Georgia's got a personality that remarkably contrasts with Chaplin's tenderness, and confirms that sometimes, the coldness of the mountains is easier to tolerate than the heart's. She will eventually regret her act after having hurt the Little Fellow's feelings.The story of The Gold Rush is a gripping and exhilarating journey through the conquest of mountain and hearts and find gold in both.. There's the heart of brave men beating inside, and this is the inspirational aspect that completes the film. It tells us a story, with memorable characters, a mature romance, great special effects, and a succession of iconic moments forever engraved in our memories. From where can I start? The iconic shoe eating scenes, a scene that had to be rehearsed more than 60 times to satisfy the perfectionism of Chaplin, the hallucination scene, The Little Fellow's frenetic joy when he got a date and during a vision of that very date, the scene that would define the film, the bread rolls dance, an image forever associated with Charlie Chaplin, and that would be parodied in many other films. The Gold Rush is Chaplin's confirmation of what The Kid implied, and that the following films would never disappoint.Finally, I'm glad I had the chance to watch the version with Chaplin's narration as it certainly gave more life to the film, and even if I could have understood the story, it sure gave an idea of the actors' pantomime talent. Chaplin's voice provided a comforting presence in a film that needed that while the beautiful music embodied the mix of sad sweetness and tender love that inhabits Chaplin's heart of gold, before he finally found it with Big Jim.I said the film was mature, not quite.

With a cast like this, how could this movie possible be bad?

To sum it up, you see Dan Aykroyd in some horrible makeup that makes him look like old and disgusting. Without warning there are two fat guys in slimy fat suits who, according to the movie, were kicked out of high school for being too fat. But for some reason they run around in underwear and talk like babies.

Baby passes the sign, warned by Johnny's cousin and Johnny asking What's she doing here? Taking time out from playing? Is she worth it, can heart and soul really belong to the staff, the people, herself belonging to the (rich) guests? She helps Penny not only with the father money for the backstreet abortion, later calling for daddy when it went bad, not only a stand-in at the Sheldrake, before this the hard-work-rehearsal with the hostile Johnny. Not bothering Penny's  Go back to your playpen, Baby and Robbie Goulds some people count, some people don't. The Kellerman's grandson tells Baby, seeing her sister with Robbie Sometimes in this world you see things you do not want to see. A minute later she sees the weeping Penny, something that is not meant for her eyes and acts accordingly, worth her future at the Peace Corps. Not to recognize but see beyond Kellerman's peaceful playpen. Baby, named after Frances Perkins, the first woman in the U.S. Cabinet, knows what she wants. And Johnny Castle, the working class guy, both falling in love with each other. When he is accused for theft Baby frees him, admitting that she spent the night with him followed by the father-daughter-confrontation. Johnny gets his summer bonus but has to leave by the back door. For the first time Johnny Castle experiences a persons courage. But Baby denies, pointing to the fact that she is nothing else but afraid of everything. Returning through the front door he pulls Frances out of the corner and up on stage Sorry for the interruption, folks, but I always do the last dance of the season. This year somebody told me not to. So I'm gonna do my kind of dancing' with a great partner, who's not only a terrific dancer, but somebody... who's taught me... that there are people willing to stand up for other people no matter what it costs them. Somebody who's taught me about the kind of person I wanna be. Miss Frances Houseman. Then the dance &#x96; and the lift. In the back the staff, the people. Suddenly everybody joins the whirl of Johnny's and Baby's dirty dancing, based on the rule This is my dance space &#x96; your dance space. Keep our places and grip. Dirty Dancings core is, as the director sees it I think that Dirty Dancing is the most intimate communication outside the bedroom. It is not dirty at all. Two people looking at each other, looking into each others eyes and try to say 'I love you.' Its beautiful. This is my dance space &#x96; your dance space. The process from recognition to see each other admitting in front of the audience love, able the lifts climax. Able and ready for the Peace Corpse. Beyond politics, religion just the people, their needs. Inspired by JFKs speech at 200 a.m. on October 14, 1960 addressed students on the steps of the University of Michigan Union. Possible. Summer 1963, 22 November the shot in Texas, Dallas.

All's your gonna get is This movie sucks--It's no Saw--I have seen better.All slamming young people aside, this movie will be an eternal classic. It scared me when I was a kid and it still scares me now. Nothing holds a candle to this John Carpenter classic. The music is chilling, the story is awesome and the characters are very well done.When John Carpenter was given the OK, he knew exactly what scared people and his view of the killer sends chills up and down my spine when I see the Shape closing in on people. Even though I have seen the film 100's of times, it is still worth the view.Even decades from now, Halloween will still be celebrated by those who know a classic when they see it and many conventions will be held to cater to those people. Michael Myers, the man and name, is tantamount to terror and night time shivers to the nth degree. Even though Hollywood seriously botched the sequels (until Halloween H20) they still offered Halloween fans something to help them appreciate the original.Jamie Lee Curtis started out as a nobody in the film but became an instant scream queen because of her excellent portrayal of Myer's sister. All the angles were covered by Carpenter which adds up to not only a great story but a good lesson in how to make a scary movie that will endure.So, keep up your head and enjoy the classic, the only--Halloween!!
