First off, why does she still have a decoy? She's not the Queen anymore, and why would anyone even want to assassinate Padme? So right off that bat we never learn this. Then comes the Jedi who are investigating her assignation attempt yet in this movie when Anakin escorts Padme to her home world, they do absolutely NOTHING to shelter themselves from an attack. They go out on romantic walks, play in the grass and so on, which makes it out like the assassination never meant anything.Instead of having this big romantic setting, they could have at least had Anakin really protect Padme, let them go through 3 or 4 assassination attempts and from there she falls in love with him. That would have made more sense than nothing besides throwing them in the most romantic settings ever.As for the love story, there really is nothing to it. It's just two attractive people in the most romantic settings. Anakin is not allowed to love because it's forbidden in the Jedi order, yet Padme cannot love because she's a senator? COME ON! She's not the Queen anymore! That don't make any sense (like the majority of things in the prequels) So the movie is called The Attack of the Clones yet the Clones are not even the main part of the movie. Actually I don't know what was the main story. We still don't have a main character or protagonist. Obi Wan investigates the assassination plot and ends up on a planet where they are making clones. Then the Jedi Council like complete idiots thinks the clones are connected to the assassinations attempts. WOW! Think outside the box for once! The Jedi are supposed to be wise right? As for the fake computer generated action scenes and characters including Yoda, this is where Lucas uses story to extend the use of special effects. George Lucas ruins everything that made Yoda so wise in the originals by having him fight with a light saber. This contradicts everything Yoda said in ESB. Yoda never taught Luke with a light saber, his whole message to Luke was that the Force was his strongest ally and the light saber didn't matter. Along with Yoda whipping out of a baby sized light saber, is just more of countless light saber fights between characters that mean nothing.This one proved everything about the prequels trying to shove in as much junk as they could in every single frame. The original trilogy was a modern day collage of classic adventure, and the original trilogy also had much character development. For instance Han Solo and Luke Skywalker. At first they don't really like each other, then they save each other a few times, and eventually bound together like true friends. Just like real people. Now compare that to the characters in AOTC. Padme and Anakin have nothing to devolve from in their romance while Han and Leia had grown feelings for each other over time.This review can go on to a million things wrong with this movie, but to make it short watch Red Letter Media's review of Attack of the Clones if you need anything more that is wrong with these movies.

The plot is well known so I won't rehash too much. Simply enough, the movie sees the protagonist, George, travel into the future. After a few stops in the 20th century, being encased in a mountain forces him 800,000 plus years into the future. He meets the Eloi, a peaceful people, and later their captors, the Morlocks. George helps the Eloi, including his love interest Weena to escape from their doomed existence.I often read a lot of criticism of this film. It's not like the book or the special effects aren't good enough anymore are the chief complaints. Why does that matter? The movie is fine without being like the book. As far as the FX go. They're fine for 1960 but really, this movie is not about how real it looks but about the characters. And that's where it excels.George(Rod Taylor) is everything a man should be. He craves new facts and strives for knowledge. He also is not afraid to stand up for himself or those he cares for. He freely admits wrong and apologizes for transgressions. In short, he's a great person, almost too good to be true. Rod Taylor plays him perfectly.In the future George meets Weena(Yvette Mimieux), one of the Eloi. The Eloi are passive to the point of complacency and Weena is no exception, but she quickly responds to George. Their romance blossoms but not too much. Most is left to our imagination when George returns to the future at the end of the movie. At first glance it may seem that Yvette Mimieux portrays Weena as a vacuous airhead, but as I watch this movie, I spot a lot of subtle things that make her acting job very good. She is physical with George but it's done subtly, like an innocent girl would do it. For instance, when they go see the talking rings, Weena seems to be very amused with George's curiosity. She laughs, takes his hand and pulls him along. Later she baits him into touching her when she asks him to put her hair up and then turns to him for close affection. Mimieux does a very good job of giving Weena a balance of innocence and budding sexuality.Also worth mentioning is Alan Young as Filby. He avoids the stuffy behavior of the others of George's group and keeps a sense of wonder about him. Young gives a convincing portrayal.When I was a kid my Dad was a sci-fi buff so I saw lots of the old classics. War of the Worlds, Forbidden Planet, and The Thing were often watched by me, but The Time Machine is my favorite. When I saw it as a teen, I was fascinated with a post-apocalyptic future and this movie has that. But when I see it as an adult, I'm more moved by the characters. George has a sense of adventure about him that keeps me interested in him. Of course, Weena kept my interest as a teen and as an adult male for different reasons, but I won't sell Yvette Mimieux short as an actress. She does a great job.See this movie and avoid the cynicism that has affected movie goers today. I know you'll love it.

All you got to do is watch Donnie's family. To give you an idea, imagine the AB Burnhams but with Lester having married Ricky's mother instead of Carolyn and having become like her. Say, what kind of a father sits, laughing meekly while his kids ping-pong F.U.s all over the diner table? What kind, when his wife tells him that their son just called her a bitch, just shrugs his shoulders You're not a bitch but now you're bitching. So, you see it the writing is amongst the worst you'll ever see, from beginning to end. As for the characters, they are the lamest, shallowest ever, starting with same father; most of them just cardboard cuts. The acting goes from so-so to putrid--with special mention to said father--but you can't really blame the actors; the cinematography is ordinary. Now, a movie is in deep trouble when, already in the beginning, the filmmaker, realizing he got nothing to say or show, proceeds to pad the clunker with assorted dialog; with inane, out of place, political references; with meaningless visual gimmicks--such as people suddenly jumping into fast motion mode when walking in corridors, for no reason at all. And what about the subplot of the Asian girl, what was its meaning? Was it that ethnics have feelings too? Was it that fat people are beautiful? Whatever message they tried to convey there it was lost, as the only way said girl is able to relate to others is by shouting Chut up! Putrid script, bad directing.If AB works so well it is simply because its characters are perfectly defined; crafted all with strong personal features, from the very beginning, and so they interact with each other in cohesive, unequivocal fashion, all which give the movie a solid structure, a clear direction&#x97;so much so that that for itself is enough to carry the whole movie for almost an hour. No such luck with this dog. Characters here are dispersed all over, lost in a desert, walking in random circles, with no purpose at all. See for ex. how flimsy Donnie's connection with his sisters is; you may even say there's none at all. They just happen to live under the same roof. And see how the parents' couple works--rather doesn't. There's no tension there, no complicity, no intimacy whatsoever; that couple is just as phony & contrived as the rest in the movie. Donnie's family is obviously not one, by any means, but just strange, unrelated people who were picked one by one, in different places, and brought to this table. There's no structure or cohesion in their group; no consistency in their chats, no common thread, no follows up. That's not a real family, just members of the Hear What Random Thought Just Crossed My Mind Club in one of their meetings. And you can say the same of the school teachers, the students, even of Donnie's romantic couple.DD contaminates everything it touches, it makes it shallow, puerile. It may contain also a record number of dumb lines Ex., when teacher Barrymore tells an attractive new student to sit next to the boy she finds the cutest--sure, teachers love nothing more than creating causes for distraction in their classes! (BD's teacher is supposed to act daring, innovative, but it only manages to appear dumb & clueless she challenges every authority in school and then...she's shocked when getting fired!). Or when Donnie's dad advises him to say F.U. to anyone who annoys him--exactly what all fathers advice their sons to do, to succeed in life. Then, I imagine, when kids coming of age reunite, they talk of their traumas, hopes, dreams; but here what they do? They talk of the sex life of Smurfs!...while laughing at a poor senile old woman (And what about that masturbating mental patient?).The worst thing about DD is that it glorifies mental illness. See, the only ones here having even limited access to the mechanisms of Time, Life, are a senile old lady and a psychotic kid. The rest, what we fools call normal people--teachers & parents--are dumb, clueless. This twisted idea is presented in a most grotesque, manipulative, way in the Donnie\/Mrs. Farmer exchange on Love vs. Fear. What's so insidious is the fact that it's the borderline psychotic the one presenting the voices of reason; a scheme repeated later in relation to Swayze's overacted preacher. See how while Donnie presents a reasonable, logical POV, normals in the audience appear lost, clueless. It's impossible to find a more cynical way of presenting mental illness under a positive light.But on a pure cinematographic way the worst manipulative feature of DD is the gratuitous inclusion of cartoon villains who will do terrible things with the only purpose of making the hero look good. That's their only use here; and the best way for us of recognizing putrid writing. The obvious ones are Mrs. Farmer and Donnie's Nemesis amongst the students a cartoon bad villain who'll randomly jump out of nowhere, when we least expect, for no reason at all, just to show us he's the villain and Donnie the hero.

This twisted idea is presented in a most grotesque, manipulative, way in the Donnie\/Mrs. Farmer exchange on Love vs. Fear. What's so insidious is the fact that it's the borderline psychotic the one presenting the voices of reason; a scheme repeated later in relation to Swayze's overacted preacher. See how while Donnie presents a reasonable, logical POV, normals in the audience appear lost, clueless. It's impossible to find a more cynical way of presenting mental illness under a positive light.But on a pure cinematographic way the worst manipulative feature of DD is the gratuitous inclusion of cartoon villains who will do terrible things with the only purpose of making the hero look good. That's their only use here; and the best way for us of recognizing putrid writing. The obvious ones are Mrs. Farmer and Donnie's Nemesis amongst the students a cartoon bad villain who'll randomly jump out of nowhere, when we least expect, for no reason at all, just to show us he's the villain and Donnie the hero. The best metaphor for a flick that comes out of nowhere and there it goes back, a zero.

Since I use it to teach with, I have now seen Runaway Train probably two dozen times, and some scenes much more, as I replayed them for my own enjoyment or for thought. As you can guess, I'm a huge fan of the movie. In fact, it's my second favorite movie of all time. The first is Casablanca. I think the two have a lot in common. Manny in Runaway Train, and Rick in Casablanca, are protagonists who are cynical, self-interested, and ruthless. Each has been rendered callous partly by their choices in life, but also by the twists and turns that life has presented them. Each has been terribly scarred by a world which is uncaring, unfeeling, and unthinkingly oblivious to the sufferings of mere individuals. Each is imprisoned by circumstance and by their own pain. Both movies have huge streak of fatalism, existentialism, and determinism within them.Yet, Manny and Rick are far more widely admired by those around them than they first understand. Neither grasps that they are perceived as heroes by people who possess less stubbornness and independence. The people around them are kinder, gentler and, yes, weaker. Still, Manny and Rick have a surprising quality--they actually care much more about others than they will admit. Watch Rick in Casablanca and you'll see how vulnerable he truly is. You'll see how much peace, happiness, and love mean to him, and get some hints (the earlier Spanish Civil War, inability to return to America, and lost love) as to why those things are so poignantly painful for him to think about. Watch Manny (carefully) in Runaway Train and you'll see how how much he cares about his friend Jonah, and how hard he tries to do some good for Buck.And, Manny and Rick both face inner conflicts and painful moments of self-awareness followed by opportunities for courageous redemption. Although their choices have different consequences, once each has made his choice, he is immediately transformed into someone who is confident, at peace with himself, accepting of the price he has paid to do the right thing, happy he has truly done the work of a good man, and ready to face the future. In each movie, that transformational scene occurs at the end and is the highlight of the movie. We remember the climactic finale of each movie because those moments are the essence and message of each movie. The world hurtles onward regardless of us, but we do possess free will, the opportunity to make a difference, and the capacity to achieve inner freedom. In terms of production and editing, Runaway Train and Casablanca have further similarities. Both are sparsely shot. Each shot counts, and each has a purpose, much like each word of dialog. If you think there's something wasted in Runaway Train, watch it again and ask yourself why the director did it that way. These also are movies in which the dialogue and characters are everything. Every sentence and facial expression matters. The dialogue is sparing yet meaningful, and the characters' subtle mannerisms and expressions communicate far more than the words alone. I can watch either movie and still find something new to notice or to think about.So, there you have it. My two cents on why my two favorite movies of all time really are about the same things the indifference of the universe and the suffering it inflicts, balanced by yearning, courage, and love.

Set in New Jersey during the great depression of the 1930's, Mia Farrow plays Cecilia, a film aficionado and broken housewife. Recently, her marriage has since turned into a considerable disaster and she finds herself in frequent disagreement with her out-of-work, abusive, and even womanizing husband, Monk (Danny Aiello).Too afraid to be on her own, she naturally finds escape at the local cinema where she sits upon hours in admiration of the actors on screen and the lives in which their characters live. When the theater first features the film entitled The Purple Rose of Cario, Cecilia finds herself enamored by the film and its subsequent character, Tom Baxter (Jeff Daniels). The following day while at work as a waitress, she finds herself distracted from the mere memory of the feature and due to the nature of her reverie is there upon fired for her demeanor. She later frequents the film over and again and it is not until the happening of one her later viewings, perhaps the sixth time over, that her presence attracts the attention of Tom Baxter, causing him to come off-screen and appear before her and all others in the theater.As he confesses his attraction toward her, together the two run off as the audience and too the characters on screen (as if suddenly viable actors taking part in play) remain caught in panic and awe. Word soon spreads that a character in a feature film has walked off screen, discovering the real-world. Not unexpectedly the news spreads quickly to ears of the film's producer, Raoul Hirsch, and the actor who portrays Tom Baxter, Gil Shepherd (Jeff Daniels). Mr. Hirsch's objective here is to stop the mass running of his picture to cease any further occurrences that share semblance and potential lawsuits.

But after i watched this movie i become interested in old movies because this is quite different.The director Roman Polanski shows why he is seen as one of the best directors in the world with this movie.Its now scary but breathtaking.The events are mostly about Rosemary.Satanism is one of the main themes in this movie and Rosemary's husband and their neighbors are satanists.Rosemary gives birth to Satan's baby.I wish i could see the whole face of the baby but i could only see his eyes.Mia Farrow(Rosemary) is acting quite good in the movie.She is a new couple with Guy Woodhouse(John Cassavetes).Instead of blood and violence swift scenes are used to scare the audience. When I started to watch it, I also expected something more normal. But during the movie, the clues help you to figure out what will happen.The movie was made in 1968 but its very successful in portraying anxiety and suspect. The characters are so different from recent horror movies.In recently horror movies we can realize who are good and who are bad but in this movie Rosemary's neighbors Minnie and Roman are seen very helpful,very kind and generous people.To sum up if you are interested in strange movies Rosemary's Baby is so appropriate for you. You could enjoy the movie much more than you could enjoy the cheap bloody scary movies. What's the secret of Rosemary's Baby? It just knows how to keep a secret ...

For sure, it is one of the best Westerns ever made, and also a very important film.Like today's television show Breaking Bad, the harsh American west is an important part of the experience. There are plenty of long shots, showing just how empty and desolate the world can be; like the personality of the 'hero', Ethan Edwards. John Wayne impresses more than ever as his conflicted, layered character, a large part of the film's success. The tone of The Searchers shifts throughout the film through most of the first 70 percent, it is a dark story with little hope. This is also beneficial to the film, as several other westerns I've seen are too lighthearted to be taken seriously. The Searchers has a cloud over its head, so it stands out... until the tone lifts, and it becomes less interesting because of that. After the wedding scene, the overarching sense of dread disappeared.*Spoilers* this cumulated in an ending where everything turns out well the good guys survive, the girl is rescued, Ethan has a change in heart, the bad guy is killed, and the boy gets the girl. Considering that early, I thought there would be no happy endings at all, this was disappointing that there was no tragedy at the end. *end spoilers*Completed with strong messages about racism and personal transformation, it is clear why The Searchers is so fondly remembered even 50 years later. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"7 June 2011","score":"2 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" The Searchers is an interesting film it has action, well developed characters, an interesting plot and strong themes.
