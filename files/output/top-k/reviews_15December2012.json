That now, with all of your more developed skills, you could've done that same assignment to a higher degree of quality or ease? That's how I felt watching One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest for the second time. 2 years ago I enjoyed the plot, characters, and ending, but now, 2 years and over 150 films later, I can appreciate One Flew Over for what it is a masterpiece of fiction, and a deceptively challenging piece of art.I'll jump past the plot synopsis and get to the heart of the film R.P. MacMurphy. The slacker, rebel, that kid in class who just wouldn't listen. How can you deal with a character like MacMurphy? Is something wrong with him? This is a major thematic point in Cuckoo's Nest, and the answers aren't simple. What gives someone the right to make choices for another? What is the point that someone can't think for themselves? Is there a point? Questions beget questions, especially around the idea of authority.That authority is personified by Nurse Ratched. She looks like an authority figure icy glare, skull- like face. Instantly you dislike the nurse. You're pointed in that direction by the patients. But personally, when looking at her character objectively, I didn't find her bad for most of the film. Let me elaborate a few weekends ago I met an children's organ transplant doctor. It is the most noble of work, but visually I could tell it took a toll on him. He wasn't rude, or volatile, or detached, but what he described himself as serious. Working in healthcare, seeing things go wrong, that wears you down. I believe Ratched, working (for a long time), hearing mental patients yell about trivial things such as cigarettes, day after day, takes its toll. You wouldn't be a cheerful soul after years of that. Of course at the end she does flex her cruelty and we really grow to resent her, but for most of the film I thought she was just doing her job.This is a great film to analyze because it's so opinionated. Two similar people can see it, and based off of their own experiences will draw very different conclusions about the message and characters. Many others hate Nurse Ratched. I'm sure there are those out there who don't like MacMurphy. Some will say control is necessary, others that freedom is the most important thing out there. Cuckoo doesn't really force you into believing one certain way.The hospital itself if juxtaposing the setting is a plain, boring hospital with drab white everything, but the characters are quirky and colourful. I loved them all, and didn't find anyone really annoying Chezwick's extremity, Tobar's big reactions, the Chief, General, Billy, and a near- silent Stanley Kubrick-alike. This band of misfits are a joy to watch, and have some laugh-out-loud moments like Martini eating the dice and the basketball game.Despite the hospital setting, Cuckoo is a generally smile-inducing film with a fantastic script that develops its characters well for the conclusion. And oh, the end. It is really a twist, but the second you realize what's happened, how the chips have fallen, you give an audible gasp. This is one of the great film endings, bitter and sweet, but very satisfying. It may even bring a tear to your eye. 9.4\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"15 December 2012","score":"2 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" Have you ever found a piece of old schoolwork and realized how dumb you were?

A police investigation into a brutal murder provides this drama with its momentum and drive and a tragic romantic tale adds the intensity, warmth and poignancy that elevates this movie to a higher level than that normally achieved by more routine thrillers. The story about two people from different backgrounds who fall in love, but know that their love can't transcend their circumstances, has a timeless and universal appeal which explains why this movie has retained its popularity so consistently since it was first released in 1985.When a recently widowed young Amish woman and her son are in a train station in Philadelphia, the 8-year-old boy witnesses the murder of an undercover cop. Detective Captain John Book (Harrison Ford) is put in charge of the investigation and questions Samuel Lapp (Lukas Haas), but even after showing him mug shots and arranging line-ups of suspects, the boy isn't able to finger the culprit. A little while later, however, Samuel is looking around the police office when he notices the killer's picture on a newspaper clipping that's pinned up inside a glass cabinet. When he brings this to Book's attention, it's quite a shock because the man in the photograph is the highly decorated Detective Lieutenant McFee (Danny Glover) of the Narcotics Division.Detective Book tells his superior officer Detective Chief Schaeffer (Josef Sommer) about this development and Schaeffer asks him to keep the information confidential. Shortly after, when he's shot at and injured by McFee, it becomes obvious to Book that McFee and Schaeffer are both corrupt and Samuel and his mother Rachel (Kelly McGillis) are in mortal danger. In order to protect them, Book drives them back to their Amish community but after his arrival there, he collapses and has to remain with the Amish where Rachel gradually nurses him back to health.During Book's period of recuperation, he and Rachel fall in love but he soon realises that neither of them could survive indefinitely in the other's world. Book adapts well to living with the Amish and earns their respect as he readily helps with milking cows and building a barn, but his presence in their community places them in danger, as becomes all too clear when the story reaches its action-packed conclusion.Non-verbal communication is used frequently in this movie and provides the action with an extremely natural feel. A couple of the stand-out sequences are those in which Samuel looks at Book in a way that immediately signifies that he's seen something important (when he sees McFee's photograph) and another is when Book and Rachel dance together in a barn to Sam Cooke's What A Wonderful World. The power to convey their thoughts and feelings so clearly in this way is very touching at times and also testifies strongly to the quality of the acting.The differences between the worlds that Book and Rachel inhabit couldn't be greater as the Amish reside in rural surroundings and live a quiet, non-violent existence in which it's normal for everyone to help everyone else. These people embrace old fashioned values and don't use modern conveniences such as cars and refrigerators etc. By contrast, Book's existence as a city cop is far less serene and regularly brings him into contact with violence, corruption and various other forms of errant human behaviour.Witness, with its interesting characters, its absorbing story of murder, corruption and doomed love and its marvellous acting performances, is tremendously enjoyable to watch and leaves a lasting impression.

","genre":"Crime, Drama, Romance"},{"date":"15 December 2012","score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Before Clint Eastwood was talking to chair, he was making good films like Unforgiven. Unforgiven is a uniquely different Western, at the time as it gave the audience the most realist example of how life was like in the Old West. A group of prostitutes in Big Whiskey, Wyoming, are looking for any bounty hunter to kill two cowboys who disfigured a woman's face. Sheriff Little Bill Daggett (Gene Hackman), is wanting to keep the town peaceful and is against any bounty hunters coming in. Little Bill had given the two men leniency, despite their crime. News about the reward reached Kansas, where a pig farmer William Munny (Clint Eastwood) is approach by the Schofield Kid, a boastful young man to collect the reward. Clint Eastwood is a great actor, who able to hide facts with his eyes, and his facial expression. Much of the charm of the first part of the movie is how unlikely he could be a bounty hunter, but he go on to do it because he's raising two children alone and his farm is failing. On the way, Munny's friend Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) joins in for the search of the cowboys. They weren't the first to make it to the town. Back in Wyoming, gunfighter English Bob (Richard Harris) arrive in Big Whiskey, also seeking the reward. Little Bill and his deputies savagely beat Bob, hoping to set an example for other would-be assassins. When Logan and Munny got the chance&#x97;they were able to kill one of the cowboy. It becomes apparent that Logan and Munny no longer have much stomach for murder. Logan tries to return home. Logan gets captured by the Sheriff's men and this is where the story gets intense. This is where we see how bad-ass Munny is. David Webb Peoples, adapter of both Twelve Monkeys and Blade Runner, wrote the screenplay. He wrote when Munny drinks whiskey, it's like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. The audience does truly find out whom Munny really about in the last ending scene. That was where it shined. The beat up up, pig farmer was urged by multiple consequences to take a drink and the monster erupted with horrific consequences. Mr. Hyde took a lot of prodding but his reputation was well founded and could been worse if he was the Hyde that shed all humanity. He still had a foot in his human side. There is a film noir feel to the film full of ambiguity and atmosphere. The dark Western deals frankly with the uglier aspects of violence, deep and steeped in morality. It was a perfect fit, hand for a glove. The screenplay is unique, written for Eastwood to direct. Still, the film realism is kind of distracting and depressing. It tends to break up the myth of the West. Unforgiven is a film that doesn't hold a candle to Sergio Leone's brilliant Dollars Trilogy in any way. Certainly, it's a classic Western, regardless of it not following the classic theme. There is something appealing to a film that takes an old concept and makes it up to modern standard. Everything about this movie is good, from direction to acting! Gene Hackman's acting is keyed to the film to work. The Sheriff was right. The only way to handle real criminals is to show them you are meaner and more ruthless than they are. Hackman did a perfect job of demonstrating the style' that all good law enforcement people should follow to actually get the job done effectively. Today's soft, limp wrist, politically correct cops pay a very heavy price when incorrectly believing that they can warn and make friends with bad guys; and the politicians could care less how much they or their families suffer. It finds it kind of surreal that Little Bill is painted the villain of the film. Willy tried to be a family man, Bill wanted to build a house. Bill killed one man (a mercenary) and Willy Munny killed six (most of them innocents). Any way you look at it there were no heroes in this film.

","genre":null},{"date":"15 December 2012","score":"3 out of 5 people found the following review useful","review":" Before Clint Eastwood was talking to chair, he was making good films like Unforgiven. Unforgiven is a uniquely different Western, at the time as it gave the audience the most realist example of how life was like in the Old West. A group of prostitutes in Big Whiskey, Wyoming, are looking for any bounty hunter to kill two cowboys who disfigured a woman's face. Sheriff Little Bill Daggett (Gene Hackman), is wanting to keep the town peaceful and is against any bounty hunters coming in. Little Bill had given the two men leniency, despite their crime. News about the reward reached Kansas, where a pig farmer William Munny (Clint Eastwood) is approach by the Schofield Kid, a boastful young man to collect the reward. Clint Eastwood is a great actor, who able to hide facts with his eyes, and his facial expression. Much of the charm of the first part of the movie is how unlikely he could be a bounty hunter, but he go on to do it because he's raising two children alone and his farm is failing. On the way, Munny's friend Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) joins in for the search of the cowboys. They weren't the first to make it to the town. Back in Wyoming, gunfighter English Bob (Richard Harris) arrive in Big Whiskey, also seeking the reward. Little Bill and his deputies savagely beat Bob, hoping to set an example for other would-be assassins. When Logan and Munny got the chance&#x97;they were able to kill one of the cowboy. It becomes apparent that Logan and Munny no longer have much stomach for murder. Logan tries to return home. Logan gets captured by the Sheriff's men and this is where the story gets intense. This is where we see how bad-ass Munny is. David Webb Peoples, adapter of both Twelve Monkeys and Blade Runner, wrote the screenplay. He wrote when Munny drinks whiskey, it's like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. The audience does truly find out whom Munny really about in the last ending scene. That was where it shined. The beat up up, pig farmer was urged by multiple consequences to take a drink and the monster erupted with horrific consequences. Mr. Hyde took a lot of prodding but his reputation was well founded and could been worse if he was the Hyde that shed all humanity. He still had a foot in his human side. There is a film noir feel to the film full of ambiguity and atmosphere. The dark Western deals frankly with the uglier aspects of violence, deep and steeped in morality. It was a perfect fit, hand for a glove. The screenplay is unique, written for Eastwood to direct. Still, the film realism is kind of distracting and depressing. It tends to break up the myth of the West. Unforgiven is a film that doesn't hold a candle to Sergio Leone's brilliant Dollars Trilogy in any way. Certainly, it's a classic Western, regardless of it not following the classic theme. There is something appealing to a film that takes an old concept and makes it up to modern standard. Everything about this movie is good, from direction to acting! Gene Hackman's acting is keyed to the film to work. The Sheriff was right. The only way to handle real criminals is to show them you are meaner and more ruthless than they are. Hackman did a perfect job of demonstrating the style' that all good law enforcement people should follow to actually get the job done effectively. Today's soft, limp wrist, politically correct cops pay a very heavy price when incorrectly believing that they can warn and make friends with bad guys; and the politicians could care less how much they or their families suffer. It finds it kind of surreal that Little Bill is painted the villain of the film. Willy tried to be a family man, Bill wanted to build a house. Bill killed one man (a mercenary) and Willy Munny killed six (most of them innocents). Any way you look at it there were no heroes in this film. Clint's acting is just bar none, and it is a movie that has characters so compelling, it makes you wonder about the nature of humanity. Everybody soon learns a harsh lesson about the price of vindictive bloodshed and the malleability of ideas like justice.

This movie tries way too hard to be prophetic and ironic at the same time and fails sensationally on both counts. When I watch a movie, I know I'm watching a good one, when the actors are natural and the story-line draws me in. When I see the actors as just actors, looking for their marks, woodenly reciting their lines and generally just not getting into the moment, I know that the movie is total crap. And it is. Such is the case with eXistenZ. The creators came up with a very lame and almost non-existent plot-line, injected a lot of gory-looking vivisections of poor mutated creatures into the middle, tacked on surprise ending of massively rigid proportions, much aimless coming and going throughout by all the characters with lots of insipid fill dialog, a few decent sexy shots of Jennifer Jason Leigh in unnaturally rigid profile positions that probably made her calves bind up, and Jude Law doing some routine wide-eyed who me scenes that only made one wonder how innocent this guy really could be...?My husband says gaming people are probably the ones who like this movie. But, seriously, I can't see how anyone with a majority of intact brain cells could possibly find this laughable excuse for a story remotely entertaining, never mind riveting...
