No offense to Julia Roberts because I really like her, but she better move over & make room for Mariah!I hope we all see more of Mariah on the big screen in the future. I can't even say enough about how much I loved this movie! I would go again & again & again to see it. I can't wait for video. Mariah is so beautiful. Every angle the camera got Mariah at turned out perfect. She truly radiated a glittery glow. I think Mariah is the camera's best friend. She is truly the most photogenic person I've ever seen. Forgive me you guys, I am just Mariah's biggest fan. I think she is as close to perfect as anyone could be. I think Miss Mariah Carey is one of the most underrated artists out there & she deserves some recognition.I would also like to say that the other actors in this film were great as well. Max Beesley for instance. Great acting & great looking, this guy really had my eye. Where has he been all of our lives? Also Da Brat & Tia Texada did a wonderful job as well. Did I mention I can't wait for the video? Ok, all silliness aside. This movie was full of heart. It makes you happy, makes you sad, makes you laugh, makes you cry. It is full of inspiration & life lessons.Wakes you up a bit. Don't ask me how but they throw in a love story as well.

And throughout the first half an hour of this movie, it started to prove me right. Let me explain...Glitter happens to be Mariah Carey's first lead role as an actress. It was expected that the movie would receive harsh reviews due to many critics who dislike Carey, not only as a singer, but refuse to accept her as an actress. And although the actress Mariah does not even closely compare to the singer Mariah, she does one hell of a job. Other cast mates include Max Beesley who was good, but could have been a little more convincing and the hilarious duo of Da Brat and Tia Texada, who give the movie that extra bit of flava, so to speak.Mariah plays a bi-racial child, growing up with a single parent (sound familiar?), only this time, her mother is black and has a serious drug problem. Mariah's character, Billie Frank, is forced to leave her mother's side and grows up as an orphan while befriending two young girls, Louise and Roxanne (Da Brat and Tia Texada). The three grow up together as best friends and as time goes by and the movie flashes forward in time, they move on to new experiences with and without each other.Billie is soon recognized by D.J. Dice (Max Beeseley), in a club. Dice desperately tries to pursue Billie to let him produce her as he sees incredible talent within her voice. This part of the movie starts of slow. The scenes within the first forty-five minutes were somewhat choppy and they seemed too short. As if everything was happening all at once. I thought, this is it then. It was my first time seeing Mariah Carey as an actress and she didn't convince nor impress me. I couldn't help but see Billie as Mariah during the movie. She seemed like the same person to me.Then the movie continued on and I saw myself instantly getting into it. A love forms between the two and although I felt the script should have captured more of Billie and Dice's romantic moments, it seems to be realistic, giving you the feeling that this is a real-life story happening before your very eyes, rather than a movie. The two encounter a taste of fame as Billie starts to hit it big. The rest, I'd rather not give away. Let's just say that the plot thickened and pulled you in so tightly, it left you almost breathless at the end. With numerous problems and dangerous situations, Mariah starts to portray Billie as a whole new character, so unlike herself. Her acting improves and is way more impressive. She is convincing and inspirational as she tries to find herself, something she has been trying to do the day her mother left. The ending is a shocker and by the credits I was in tears. Not only by the occurrences that Billie faces, but the WAY Mariah plays Billie so passionately and gets into character. This movie definitely had a lot of potential.The music to Glitter fits in perfectly with its time. Mariah Carey's voice sounds better than ever and she even manages to sneak a few chills down your spine as you listen. But the movie is not all song. In fact, it's not all about a singer either. With lots of twists and turns, I felt Glitter held a promising message.I definitely recommend this movie to any Mariah Carey fan out there, however, for the people who dislike her, why even bother seeing it? I wish this movie had a better beginning, but I do feel the ending was worth it. Mariah Carey proves to be quite a talented young actress and I hope that in the future she is given the chance to broaden her skills and play a character the complete opposite of herself. I definitely think she can handle it. This movie was very inspirational and taught the audience many important values in life. All in all, this is a great film and to all who criticize this movie with little reason, it's quite obvious for your disregard towards Carey. I definitely feel that if Billie Frank was played by a nobody, the reviews would have been much better...not because someone else did a better acting job, but for the pure fact that the leading actress was not Mariah Carey herself.

But why would you purchase a pretty car whose insides are damaged beyond repair?After spending $8 to see Groove - and bringing two friends, causing me to turn a deep shade of red out of embarrassment for my choice - I was in a rage. I immediately ran home to gather more information about the film. Why do people enjoy this? Why was it a hit at Sundance? It seems that people like Groove solely because it is about something they are a part of rave culture. I want to remind viewers that just because a cereal box champions your favourite sports player doesn't mean the contents are delicious. I read a review that stated, 'yes, the film is flawed, but we have so few movies about raves that it will do. Three stars!' This is a very unprofessional attitude. A truly discerning critic would rather eat no eggs at all than rotten ones.Recently, I argued with a friend that almost every film has its redeeming qualities. A good example, I told him, is Mac & Me, a mid-80s E.T. ripoff about a wheelchair-bound boy and a rubber alien puppet. It is so cluelessly flawed it's great! The kid can't act (only hired because of his disability?), the FX are cheaply done, and (for Christ's sake) SEARS is featured prominently. You have to love that. However, if one film has no redeeming qualities; if one film's only effect is of wasting time; if one film exists only to steal your soul, your creativity, and any drive or ambition you have ever had for life, it is Brad Harrison's Groove.(I have NEVER given this score to ANYthing in life) 1\/10 ","genre":"Drama, Music"},{"date":"21 September 2001","score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":"  Housekeeping came on the Independent Film Channel this afternoon while I was yammering on the phone, slurping my coffee, and flipping through the mail.

However there weren't any stereotypical girl fights.  Lucille didn't humiliate Ruth in front of her new friends, Ruth didn't retreat 100%... It struck me as being more realistic than what most movies portray in terms of girlfriends\/sisters needing to go their own ways.As for Christine Lahti...wow.  I really like her anyway and wish she did more movies of quality.  She can even make a crappy Lifetime movie watchable!  She was so subtle and perfect.  Movies generally portray the mentally ill (debateable term!) as extremists, but not here.  There's never that middle ground where so many ordinary people drift along in. There is never any completely bizarre, crazy, off-the wall behavior here and I bet most people have known someone just like her.

It's greatest flaw, I stated, was that its story was far too complicated and difficult for its own good. Although by the second time I had understood it a lot more than the first time, many parts were still undecipherable. On my third viewing, on the new Pioneer Special Edition DVD (VERY highly suggested; you can't get the edition with the collector's tin anymore, but a plastic, and actually a better box is still available), I finally got to see it in widescreen and finally in Japanese. The Japanese (or the subtitles rather, since I don't speak the language) reveals more of the political level of the story. On my fourth viewing, the first one when I watched it entirely alone, I connected the story a little better, but many questions were still unanswered. But now my attitude is this who cares?Few doubt its visual mastery; only Princess Mononoke is comparable in the level of detail. I would say that Akira is still, even compared to Mononoke, on a level all its own. It's something that most people tend to look over when they're examining animation, but the techniques of the direction are actually highly developed. The techniques of direction in animation are still far behind those of live action film because the medium is not taken seriously. The Japanese are solving this problem, but Akira is still its peak.I have previously talked about its more human side, trying to shut those up who accuse it of being nothing but spectacle. Here, too, comparing it with Mononoke, which stands as the most universally liked anime film in America (despite what Disney thinks; btw, if you think I'm ragging on Mononoke Hime, I do love it. Check out my user comment on it, although I don't quite like it as much as I did upon my first viewing), I think the emotional and human values of Akira are greater. There has been a constant fuss about the ambiguity of Mononoke's characters. There're no good guys or bad guys, is a popular phrase that I think even I used to describe the characters in the film. If there are no purely good guys, then what is Ashitaka, for instance? Akira's characters are actually much more ambiguous. I bizarrely chose to compare Ashitaka with Travis Bickle, the crazy taxi driver from, well, Taxi Driver in describing how complex I felt his character was. I'm embarrassed that I said such a silly thing; not that Ashitaka, despite his good- guy ethics, isn't a complex character; it's just that comparing him with Travis Bickle implies something that it oughtn't to. Now Tetsuo can be fairly compared with Travis Bickle. As Roger Ebert once said about Bickle, Taxi Driver is a great film because we can all identify with Bickle, even if we would never go as far as he did.Tetsuo is the same way there is an enormous amount of pathos in that character. Caneda is just as well developed. To see just how well written this script is, follow Caneda's developement throughout the film. He is not the same person at the end. Kaori, Yamagata, Kai, the Colonel, Masaru, Kiyoko, and Takashi have quite a bit of depth, too. Perhaps the only characters who come off a little thin are Kei and Ryu; this is because of the difficulties the screenwriters had in developing that particular aspect of the film, the revolution. I'm not sure, for instance, why they were smuggling Takashi away at the film's beginning. Maybe a fifth viewing will reveal more of those aspects. Of course, the politics are only supposed to be working as the background to the struggle between Tetsuo and Kaneda.On this fourth viewing, Akira reveals itself to be one of the best science fiction movies ever made, one of the best Japanese movies I've ever seen, maybe the best (and I have seen a lot), and easily the best animated film I've ever seen.

The acting was mediocore, the film barely had any dialogue, and it doesent have that precious relationship from the original.....Cindy is with Buddy, thy barely communicate and they're not funny together. Tori Spelling is there for nothing..I mean who is she? And the I LOVE DEAD PEOPLE chick...Who is she? Sure the whole movie is a spoof, but there must be SOMTHING, the movie had no plot and it lacked in structure, it was all messed up.On the other hand there are a few jokes that were great to watch (Charlies angels,Exorcist,VITAMIN C,Guy with weird hand) they were good...Yet they dont save the film from its many downfalls.

I was depressed and thoroughly miserable and I must have watched this movie every night for at least two weeks.  While it didn't get me back together with my girlfriend, it certainly cheered me up and put a big smile on my face.  It also gave me a different perspective on relationships and how to handle them easier.  There is no plot here.  The movie opens with Rob getting dumped by his girlfriend, Laura. He then proceeds to tell the viewer about his all time top five break-ups, in chronological order.  We get flashbacks of his four most important breakups, starting when he was fourteen.  We also get to see Rob's record shop, which attracts the bare minimum of window shoppers.  Dick and Barry are his employees who chase off what few customers the store brings in.  You see, these guys consider themselves musical experts and anyone who doesn't meet their standard of musical knowledge is refused service.  The films biggest laughs come from Rob's self-deprecating remarks and Barry's antics in the store.  Jack Black plays Barry and I'm looking forward to seeing him in more stuff.  He really shines here as the obnoxious clerk who was hired for three days a week but shows up every day.  Dick (Todd Louiso) is the quiet one who looks a lot like Moby with his skinny body and bald head.  His meek, shy manner is the polar opposite of Barry.  His facial expressions are very amusing and his and Barry's arguements are hilarious. The film moves along at a nice leisurely pace, without ever getting boring, as Rob attempts to find out what keeps going wrong and why he is forever doomed at relationships.  Amidst all of this, he discovers the musical talents of a couple of skater\/punks he busted for shop-lifting.  Barry (who doesn't play any musical instruments) forms a band called the Sonic Death Monkeys and Dick finds a girlfriend.  Rob is also insanely jealous over Laura's new boyfriend, Ian (none other than a pony-tailed Tim Robbins).  Ian is the kind of pretentious, new-age fruit-loop that Rob strongly dislikes and (in this case) hates with a purple passion.  He has only one confrontation with Ian and, done three different ways, it is one of the film's funniest scenes.  I've always been a huge John Cusack fan. Ever since I was seven years old, Better Off Dead has been one of my favorite comedies since I was old enough to laugh and One Crazy Summer follows close behind.   While many stars who got their start in the eighties have faded out, Cusack has really come into his own by finding (and in this case co-writing) good, challenging material that continues to show what a good actor he really is.

I just don't LOVE it. I would never argue with its importance; it's just that I think that it doesn't rank as one of the greatest films ever made. There are at least a dozen silent feature films that I like more, including, but not limited to, The Passion of Joan of Arc (Carl Dreyer, 1928), Batteship Potemkin (Sergei Eisenstein, 1925), Sherlock Jr. (Buster Keaton, 1924), Modern Times (Charlie Chaplin, 1936), Safety Last (Harold Lloyd, 1923), Nanook of the North (Robert Flaherty, 1922), Our Hospitality (Keaton, 1923), and City Lights (Chaplin, 1931).The maxim to which I refer is this Between the head and hands there must be a heart (or something to that effect). In the film, Joh Frederson is figuratively the head, Grot the hands, and Freder the heart. In analogizing the film itself with that image, I would count the film's metaphoric and symbolic aspects as the head, its technical aspects the hands. The heart should be the relationship between Freder and Maria. Unfortunately, that whole piece of the film just doesn't work very well. It comes off as merely mechanical.What is left is still amazing. Hardly any film has matched its stunning sets. A few of the set pieces rank as some of the best ever created, for example, Moloch devouring the workers, Freder working the arms of the clock, the Tower of Babel story, the transformation of Rotwang's robot, Mecha-Maria's erotic dance, and a few others. However, there are a lot of segments that move as slow as molasses. There are a lot of scenes where characters stare at each other for so long that it proceeds to become silly.In fact, it can be generally silly. A lot of people were laughing at somewhat inappropriate moments at the screening that I attended tonight. It is very dated, as you probably would expect a silent sci-fi movie to be. I wonder, though, if this is a German phenomenon. All silent films are dated up to a point, but a lot are very enjoyable still in a way different than sound films. The three German UFA silents I've seen, Metropolis, The Last Man, and Nosferatu (the latter two both directed by the famed F.W. Murnau) all seem more dated than usual to me. I know all three of those films have a lot of fans, but they all seem stale to me.Tonight I saw the film in a theater with live music - a great experience if you've never had the chance to do it. The version was a brand new reconstruction which ran at 157 minutes. 157!?!?!?The version that I own is only 120, and I get kind of bored during it. Fortunately, with the live piano music, as opposed to the usual, torturous sythesizer which accompanies most versions of the film on video, it was much easier to endure. Although I haven't seen the 120 minute version for about two years, I can speculate as to what was added in this version. Rotwang's character seemed to be expanded - I had always seen him simply as a mad scientist without any real character. Here, I believe that more of a motive has been supplied. The worker whom Freder substitutes at the clock-like work station, worker 11811, has more of a story, though a lot of its elements have been lost and were told through intertitles. There was also a lot more concerning the thin man, a spy whom Joh Frederson orders to follow his son. There must have been more, but I don't really feel like watching my VHS tape of it right now. This was the third silent film I ever saw, the first I ever owned, and my rank has always been 8\/10, regardless of the version.

Child robot David acts as replacement for lost son2. David experiences Flesh Fair3. David searches for Blue Fairy to become human4.
