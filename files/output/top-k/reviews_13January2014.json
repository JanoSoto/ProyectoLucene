Yes, the movie is over-the-top, overdone, and excessive. However, when the tag line is The world is yours, what other way is there to do it? The movie is supposed to be this way because Tony Montana (Al Pacino) wants it all, as in the world and everything in it.Pacino can be a fireball, and he is nothing short of that as Tony Montana, an overly ambitious, short-tempered political prisoner from Cuba during the Castro-Revolution era. There are 226 uses of the f word in the film, and Montana probably accounts for 90 percent of them. If anyone else would dare take on such a character with an excessively profane script, which was written by Oliver Stone, the film probably would have been a bust because Pacino did it so well to me and it has become the staple of his career along with Michael Corleone in the Godfather films. The story is also just so incredibly played out throughout the film. I have never watched a film 170 minutes or longer that goes by in what feels like an hour, not even The Godfather or The Godfather Part II. From the political prisoner from Cuba scene to the epic Say goodnight to the bad guy monologue, and of course Say hello to my little friend, a plot in a film has never interested me so much, not even Godfather I and II.Going back to the Bad Guy rant, there's a reason why I chose to make my own little spin-off of it as the title, if you want to call it that. It's my favorite scene in the movie, and it is really the whole point of the film. After having an argument with his wife, Tony is sitting alone in a restaurant with everyone staring at him, and he says, You're all a bunch of f*****' ass*****. You know why? You don't have the guts to be what you wanna be. You need people like me. You need people like me so you can point your f*****' fingers, and say 'that's the bad guy.' The point being made is that Tony is viewed as a bad person because he is not afraid to be who he is, a short-tempered, overly ambitious man who will not hesitate to speak his mind. So many people in the world are so concerned with being liked and accepted by others, they don't stay true to who they really are and become someone they aren't, and they never obtain true happiness with that person they become, so they judge people who aren't like them and other people they try to be like. Tony goes on to say, So, what that make you? Good? You're not good. You just know how to hide, how to lie. Me, I don't have that problem. Me, I always tell the truth, even when I lie. So say goodnight to the bad guy! Come on! The last you're gonna see a bad guy like this again, let me tell you. When you watch the other people in the restaurant while Tony is saying this and looking around at them, it is very apparent that Tony is speaking the truth. When Tony tries to look at the people, they simply look straight down with a look on their faces as if they have been found out by the bad guy who is below them.Moving on to another reason why it's been my favorite film since I was 10 is four simple words, The World is Yours. I truly believe it anytime I read it, say it, or think about it. That's what I think of when I think of the iconic masterpiece that is Scarface, not all of the over-the-top acting, swearing, blood, violence, or the overly flashy suits. Those four words are what inspired rich celebrities like P. Diddy and Shaquille O'Neal to achieve what they've achieved. Those four words sold millions of posters that hang on walls all across the world. Those four words inspire me to be a accomplish great things in my life.To conclude, and make one last reiteration to the title of the review, if you hate the movie for all the reasons I previously listed, which I can understand, ask yourself this. Are all those things the only things this movie is about? The answer is no. Think with your brain, not your eyes and ears, see the film with your mind instead of your eyes. That's how I came up with my interpretation of the film that it is over-the-top and excessive but that's the way the film was supposed to be, and it was not afraid to be shown the way it is shown. Scarface is the bad guy of cinema, in my opinion, and I have been a huge fan of the bad guy for a long time. You need films like this so those people described earlier can point their fingers and say that's the bad film, or it's terrible, pointless, mindless, excessive violence with too much blood, swearing, and yelling. So, what does that make them and the movies that they like just because their friends and peers like them? Good?

We are of course given a catch up of the story, but sadly I believe they should of went with a different route. I believe that we should not have started in the middle of a Treaty over the Blockade of a planet. I believe that it is almost as if we got sequel to something that we never seen. This is the problem I have with this film, other than that, I am completely engaged in the story and the development of Obi Wan's character is perfect going from apprentice of Qui Gon to master of Anakin . Some times I think that Qui Gon and Obi Wans character should of been combined into one character aka Obi Wan Kenobi, as it would make more sense, continuity wise. Now to the more positive aspects of The Phantom Menace. First of all Liam Neeson as Qui Gon Jinn is just tremendous and I mean it, it is as if he was typecast. Jake LLoyd as Anakin Skywalker may not be the best but he just pulls it off, plus he was like 8 years of age, who can blame him. Ewan Mcgregor as Obi Wan, is mostly just there to have Obi Wan be in it, but I still think he brings a great incarnation of the character. Overall I think Star Wars Episode I The Phantom Menace is underrated classic and very re-watchable. I also think that it worked better on paper for most people and that for others it was just simply Jar Jar - do not need a explanation for that. Thank you for reading.

Joke, joke. Who would have suspected that, 20 years later incur global village, US producers and fast-buck artists would voluntarily move their productions here -- and voluntary comply with Canadian regs requiring them to top load said productions with Canadian talent -- both in front of, and behind, the camera. THE SIXTH DAY, a recent release starring The Arnold, is a marvelous case in point. Even if he is a bit long in the tooth, and even if his best Terminator roles are far behind him, Le Arnold really does deserve better than this soporific ROBOCOP clone which is so whitebread -- so completely lacking in personality, SO GOSH-DARN Canadian! -- that the only real action the viewer is likely to see is when he tries to beat the lineup at the urinals after credits role. OK, perhaps it is unfair to pick on THE SIXTH DAY. The same precise comment can be made about literally all the US movies done up here -- a billion dollars worth of annual production that voluntarily, without coercion, agreed to waddle unto the bar and guzzle down the cultural genomes of Preston Manning, Sir.

Seems a small price to pay for those cost savings -- until you realize (yet another delicious irony!) just how different the artistic standards of our two countries really are. America genuinely rewards individuality, whereas ours is a country born and raised on homogeneity. Any good film critic can spot a made in Canada US production in the first ten minutes because the scenes are all so technically perfect, so correctly lit, so lacking in imagination, that each should come with a warning not operate heavy machinery while watching. And what about all those Canadian character actors shoved helter-skelter into those secondary roles &#x97; all part of that very same purely contractual, reverse-discrimination, cultural Heimlich manoeuvre? Did I say Canadian character actors? Hell, if ever there was an oxymoron that deserved serious scrutiny by world academicians, that indeed would-be the place to start. And, while we are accumulating delicious ironies, here's yet another. The deficiencies noted above are likely to be most obvious to -- surprise! --other Canadians. Evading Canadian content where possible, and inhaling US culture in all its legal and illegal forms, is ITSELF so darn Canadian that's practically a competitive sport north of the49th parallel. Imagine the irony -- that word again -- when Canadian viewers who have practically made a career of avoiding dry, starchy, Canadian production values turn on a US vehicle like THE SIXTH DAY, only to have their very own DNA thrown back into their astonished faces. Arnold, we hardly knew ye.

Whilst obsessed with success and optimising himself, he pushes himself into the 80s yuppie lifestyle and then rails against it, and seeks to destroy anyone who believes in it. He is terrifying yet compelling to watch as his character descends deeper into psychotic frenzy as the film progresses, and he loses sight of what is reality and what is not. I cannot fault his acting - it is crisp, clean and his erratic emotions come across beautifully to the audience.The supporting cast, in particular Reese Witherspoon, Willem Dafoe and Chloe Sevigny, were perfectly cast and gave believable performances in their three very different but complementary roles. The superficiality of Witherspoon's character, who does not realise how empty her relationship with Bateman is, presents a stark contrast to the depth seen in Bateman himself. Sevigny's character, the gentle Jean, is Bateman's one weakness. He sees in her his only hope for the future. She is the only one in the movie who shows genuine selflessness or a hope for a brighter future. Her innocence and purity is portrayed very successfully by Sevigny, with soft voice and wide eyes. Dafoe's character is one the audience finds difficult to predict, and this is down to the way that his character was played. It was shot three times where Dafoe played the role three different ways, which when edited were intertwined so there is no clear picture as to who he is and what he thinks. His excellent performance can then partially be attributed to Harron, the director.The direction of this movie is exceptional. It is fast-paced and layered with additional meaning. No word goes amiss as the audience is plunged into the yuppie lifestyle and the harrowing events unfold around them. The dark comedy comes through with great subtlety, it is a satire unlike any other. You would not expect such nuance and slickness from what many class as a confusing gore, slasher or horror flick. Anyone who claims it as these things has severely missed the point.The music in this film is completely the opposite of what you would expect. Many tracks are 80s pop songs, and this is one of the crucial threads through the movie. Bateman's extensive knowledge of 80s pop shows how he is a part of the culture that he so despises. The other music is considerably different, harsh violins which increase the suspense and darken the mood. The lighting progressively dims through the movie, mirroring Bateman's descent, until the closing scene where it is once again bright as it was when the movie opened. This is a neat, but horrifying ending, as it shows the cyclical structure of the plot. The confusion in this movie is part of its brilliance. Many of the actors look similar, wear similar clothes and accessories, work in the same company and do the same job. The characters also frequently mistake one another for somebody else. Many characters appear once and then disappear for the rest of the movie. Names are interchangeable, people get mixed up, and nobody cares apart from Bateman and this is only at the end when his mind is unravelling and he craves his punishment. Then there is the ultimate question of how much of this movie is reality and how much is fantasy. As the voice-over is Bateman, it is all from his perspective, and his psychosis is so erratic and unpredictable that the audience is left as perplexed as he is. There is a perfect moment near the end of the movie where the audience sees Bateman himself realise that what he is experiencing cannot be entirely real, leading everyone, including Bateman, to question what we have seen before and what we will see after. The first time I saw the movie, I would have only given it a seven out of ten, for the superlative acting, costume, lighting and camera work. I found the plot and dialogue difficult, and when I watched the movie a second time, I saw that this was the idea. I appreciated the intense, multi-layered craftsmanship which makes this film now one of my absolute favourites. It is Harron's indisputable masterpiece in my opinion, and well worth the watch. Twice.

Scorsese, in fact, still haven't done anything as good as 'Taxi Driver' or 'Raging Bull' yet, not coincidentally both came in his earlier filmmaking years. 'Taxi Driver' is not much different than Scorsese's recent works, it has the vulgarity and the dirty life in the streets as focus, but differently than films like 'Goodfellas' and recently 'The Wolf of Wall Street', 'Taxi is done with an artistic approach, instead of just a thin paper of vulgarities translated for the screen. The most interesting thing about this film, is the character development. You really want to hate the driver, because is admittedly a despicable, antisocial, racist crazy freak. But we are so near to him all the time that's virtually impossible. We feel sorry for him, but never hate him. He believe in what he believes, and the viewer knows and understand why, despite him being wrong. That is really interesting. Somehow, you can forgive all his faults. Then he tries to establish a relation with a woman, and in the beginning they do relatively well with each other, judging by the circumstances of their meeting, but quickly he realizes that she is way too different of her(in his head, he thinks that she is as dirty as the rest of the world). He became even more upset after that 'big' disappointment, even because he really don't likes the 'dirty' people. and by 'dirty' he refers to prostitutes, bandits, people that works and have a social life, and the most controversial of all he hates 'blacks'. He is racist, noteworthy. And a completely antisocial person, but that is easily assumable.His 'rage' against the world just grows more and more, and there is a point when he start to think about really f***** up stuff. He buy guns and then becomes to train and also mastering his abilities of 'hit-man'. He became determined to 'clean' the streets, but his thoughts never turn in actions. He just drive his taxi at night and then train with his weapons in the free-time, but never do nothing about it. I think this is an interesting concept, you know, about people who have fear to concrete his actions. Its an spot on metaphor, because this really happens, people which never create courage to do what he wants to. So, we all know that he isn't a crazy psycho, I mean, he still crazy, but we know that psychos don't hesitate, feel fear, or anything.But apart from the 'most interesting' thing, there is also the 'most important' thing about the film, who shall be understood. It's, after all, a harsh critic about those individuals that put the fault in everyone due to their condition, but not in themselves, and how this human beings are egocentric. Noteworthy, how the 'driver' behavior changed, after doing something he considered 'relevant' in his life. He simply became a cool person(apparently) after that. Is a fantastic metaphor, it's basically saying if people could do everything they wanted to, so they would be not upset about the world, that in their vision is being 'unfair' with them. Obviously, it's my point of view, can be refuted or accepted but will still a theory and my point of view. There is more thoughts about the film here than the content about the film itself, I guess, but I just think that's a film that it's content can't be told at all only with detailing about his components, how it was made etc., so a superficial review about the cinematography, the storyline and the direction, wouldn't be enough, in my opinion. It's a film that really left you thinking about it for a long time. It's rich in content, and open for various interpretations. Dawn, I don't even mentioned about the 'contradiction' idea, which is the base for the story of the driver. So, as you see, there is a lot of stuff in the film to be analyzed.So, yeah, I think that's a done review, perhaps it's a review targeted more for people who have watched the film, but it hasn't 'super spoilers' or something like that either. I didn't tell even half the story, so if you'll haven't watched it just yet and read my review, don't worry. You'll still enjoy it, for sure. Now, my rating is 9.5\/10. One of Scorsese best, alongside Raging Bull, and It absolutely deserves it's 'classic status'. What more can I say? Watch this film.

","genre":"Crime, Drama"},{"date":"13 January 2014","score":"","review":" Taxi Driver is a film that marked the start of the 'modern filmmaking'. Scorsese, in fact, still haven't done anything as good as 'Taxi Driver' or 'Raging Bull' yet, not coincidentally both came in his earlier filmmaking years. 'Taxi Driver' is not much different than Scorsese's recent works, it has the vulgarity and the dirty life in the streets as focus, but differently than films like 'Goodfellas' and recently 'The Wolf of Wall Street', 'Taxi is done with an artistic approach, instead of just a thin paper of vulgarities translated for the screen. The most interesting thing about this film, is the character development. You really want to hate the driver, because is admittedly a despicable, antisocial, racist crazy freak. But we are so near to him all the time that's virtually impossible. We feel sorry for him, but never hate him. He believe in what he believes, and the viewer knows and understand why, despite him being wrong. That is really interesting. Somehow, you can forgive all his faults. Then he tries to establish a relation with a woman, and in the beginning they do relatively well with each other, judging by the circumstances of their meeting, but quickly he realizes that she is way too different of her(in his head, he thinks that she is as dirty as the rest of the world). He became even more upset after that 'big' disappointment, even because he really don't likes the 'dirty' people. and by 'dirty' he refers to prostitutes, bandits, people that works and have a social life, and the most controversial of all he hates 'blacks'. He is racist, noteworthy. And a completely antisocial person, but that is easily assumable.His 'rage' against the world just grows more and more, and there is a point when he start to think about really f***** up stuff. He buy guns and then becomes to train and also mastering his abilities of 'hit-man'. He became determined to 'clean' the streets, but his thoughts never turn in actions. He just drive his taxi at night and then train with his weapons in the free-time, but never do nothing about it. I think this is an interesting concept, you know, about people who have fear to concrete his actions. Its an spot on metaphor, because this really happens, people which never create courage to do what he wants to. So, we all know that he isn't a crazy psycho, I mean, he still crazy, but we know that psychos don't hesitate, feel fear, or anything.But apart from the 'most interesting' thing, there is also the 'most important' thing about the film, who shall be understood. It's, after all, a harsh critic about those individuals that put the fault in everyone due to their condition, but not in themselves, and how this human beings are egocentric. Noteworthy, how the 'driver' behavior changed, after doing something he considered 'relevant' in his life. He simply became a cool person(apparently) after that. Is a fantastic metaphor, it's basically saying if people could do everything they wanted to, so they would be not upset about the world, that in their vision is being 'unfair' with them. Obviously, it's my point of view, can be refuted or accepted but will still a theory and my point of view.

He's now become an instant social outcast and seems mystified as to why the students behave the way they do as he tries to blend in with the others. He appears to have a bit of a tough streak in him, but when he gets into an entanglement with the toughest bullies, he now feels he is totally out of his league. His anger and his determination are his defensive weapons when the going got tough, which at the same time was his downside as well as he becomes a prey to these goons. The wounds don't heal any faster as one of the goon's ex-girlfriend starts to show affection towards Daniel. It does however, adds the dramatic effect toward the tough Jersey teen.One night, while the goons are chasing after Daniel, and they beat the living daylights out of him, the handyman from Daniel's apartment steps up and defends Daniel against these punks and takes them down easily because they are just thugs with no form of training. The handyman's name is Mr. Miyagi (Pat Morita) and after seeing such a sight, Daniel asks Miyagi if he could train him to fight like him. Very reluctant at first, fearing that Daniel will want to use his skills for vanity purposes and that there is more to karate than just whipping butt and gaining recognition. This is where we get to the meat of the story after we just finished slurping the soup as we now see the movie shift gears from a high-school drama Hallmark Channel schmaltz into a compelling character study with a coming-of-age theme implemented in the story.Ralph Macchio has his fun in the sun as the titular character that made his presence known for his heart-rending performance in the 1983 classic The Outsiders. He was still relatively young at the time was not that polished as a performer, and at times he still feels a bit green in his performance. However, he does capture the image of the alienation in a world that seems rather new to his old surroundings. The casting directors were spot-on when they casted Arnold from Happy Days Pat Morita in the role of handyman\/karate trainer Mr. Miyagi. His execution was perfectly put in place as a subdued, but very spiritual and intellectual as he was the foundation that held this film together. It was a no-doubter that Mr. Morita was the winner for Best Supporting Actor at the Oscars.In the 80's there was a lot of cheesy movies that came out, The Karate Kid was one of the many films that overcame the cheesiness to bring you two solid hours of inspiration, entertainment as well as knowledge. It may look towards the younger age demographic, as it shows that even underdogs can achieve success if they put their minds to it. But the central theme in The Karate Kid is that vengeance is not a solution. There are other ways to crack the bully code without having to crush their balls. And the message stands true to today's standards as schools are petitioning to stop bullying without fighting back. The Miyagi and Daniel chemistry is one of the richest in film history and throw in a young Elisabeth Shue in the mixture you get pure gold in cinema. Not only is it educational, but it's also a gentle film that everyone in the family can get to enjoy.

In a sense, it does but in a different way than your standard track race of 99 laps. It involves much more than that and to demonstrate this, a cast of actors were chosen for this franchise that have taken the genre of driving cars to the next level. This is the movie that brought several no name actors to the spotlight. The most obvious is Vin Diesel and Paul Walker. And what almost seemed like would be a strange mashup of racing and detective work, turned out to be a fairly solid film.Paul Walker plays Brian O'Conner, an undercover cop who is trying to help the FBI capture a group of road bandits who end up plundering innocent truck drivers traveling down highways. To do this, he digs deep into the underworld of street racing where racers of different backgrounds and revved up cars come together for a common cause. The thrill of the ride and all the benefits that come with it; sex, drugs, respect and money. As he slowly assimilates with his surroundings, he befriends a man named Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his family members. There he begins to investigate who is behind the truck jackings.This is actually not a bad plot at all. The writing does have its weak points, which will be touched upon but let's start with the positive. I enjoyed how O'Conner has to come to grips with himself and who he's going to support. This shows that he's a human being and has a conscious. The same goes for Dominic Toretto, in a different way though. Toretto must come to grips with himself knowing he wasn't the person he once was. Both characters are from very different worlds yet they share a struggle that resembles each other. That struggle is being human and knowing who you are as a person. Sure it's not believable in every aspect but at least it lets the audience know that these characters do have a mind of their own.The weak part to the film is the final scene. All there is to say is that it is too abrupt. It completely detours from what the plot was centered on, along with leaving a few subplots open for interpretation. But was it needed - no. It would be nice to see some closure on more than one subplot. Surely if this franchise didn't earn a sequel then where would the conclusion to this story be? Hard to say. But if there's one thing that helps make up for that are the racing sequences to this movie. Even if you're not a racing fan, the action scenes should entertain. I mean, who doesn't want to (or enjoys already) driving over the speed limit for fun? Driving at high speeds gets the adrenaline pumping and makes every action much more intense. So if you don't enjoy that kind of thing, this movie isn't for you.The editing by Peter Honess who also did The Shadow (1994), L.A. Confidential (1997) and Highlander (1986) did a good job here as well. The shots are well connected and will keep the attention of the audience quite easily. The score produced by BT isn't anything to praise over though. Some action scenes didn't even contain music, which was odd because you'd think one would want to make that scene more intense by adding music. And although he doesn't create a theme for the franchise, his music does match the tone and attitude of the film. And for this kind of film, as long as it maintains that, that's all that matters. Because there is also contemporary music inserted in various scenes, BT's music transitions well into the contemporary music. It's good.It lacks logic in a few areas and has a loose ending but the car scenes and actors help them overcome that. Plus it has some unexpected character development that helps give the main characters a good amount of charm.

As he slowly assimilates with his surroundings, he befriends a man named Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his family members. There he begins to investigate who is behind the truck jackings.This is actually not a bad plot at all. The writing does have its weak points, which will be touched upon but let's start with the positive. I enjoyed how O'Conner has to come to grips with himself and who he's going to support. This shows that he's a human being and has a conscious. The same goes for Dominic Toretto, in a different way though. Toretto must come to grips with himself knowing he wasn't the person he once was. Both characters are from very different worlds yet they share a struggle that resembles each other. That struggle is being human and knowing who you are as a person. Sure it's not believable in every aspect but at least it lets the audience know that these characters do have a mind of their own.The weak part to the film is the final scene. All there is to say is that it is too abrupt. It completely detours from what the plot was centered on, along with leaving a few subplots open for interpretation. But was it needed - no. It would be nice to see some closure on more than one subplot. Surely if this franchise didn't earn a sequel then where would the conclusion to this story be? Hard to say. But if there's one thing that helps make up for that are the racing sequences to this movie. Even if you're not a racing fan, the action scenes should entertain. I mean, who doesn't want to (or enjoys already) driving over the speed limit for fun? Driving at high speeds gets the adrenaline pumping and makes every action much more intense. So if you don't enjoy that kind of thing, this movie isn't for you.The editing by Peter Honess who also did The Shadow (1994), L.A. Confidential (1997) and Highlander (1986) did a good job here as well. The shots are well connected and will keep the attention of the audience quite easily. The score produced by BT isn't anything to praise over though. Some action scenes didn't even contain music, which was odd because you'd think one would want to make that scene more intense by adding music. And although he doesn't create a theme for the franchise, his music does match the tone and attitude of the film. And for this kind of film, as long as it maintains that, that's all that matters. Because there is also contemporary music inserted in various scenes, BT's music transitions well into the contemporary music. It's good.It lacks logic in a few areas and has a loose ending but the car scenes and actors help them overcome that. Plus it has some unexpected character development that helps give the main characters a good amount of charm.

In a sense, it does but in a different way than your standard track race of 99 laps. It involves much more than that and to demonstrate this, a cast of actors were chosen for this franchise that have taken the genre of driving cars to the next level. This is the movie that brought several no name actors to the spotlight. The most obvious is Vin Diesel and Paul Walker. And what almost seemed like would be a strange mashup of racing and detective work, turned out to be a fairly solid film.Paul Walker plays Brian O'Conner, an undercover cop who is trying to help the FBI capture a group of road bandits who end up plundering innocent truck drivers traveling down highways.

The acting in The Color Purple is what I believe makes this film stand out from other films of similar topics. Celie has meekness drilled into her, and Whoopi Goldberg portrays this concisely by constantly sheltering herself, her feelings, and most importantly her smile. Sofia, the character Oprah Winfrey plays, also is one of my personal favorite characters with her witty remarks, spiritedness, and capturing life throughout the movie. Both of these actors were able to effortlessly convey complex emotion ranging from oppression to freedom, and to despair to optimism. The lives that these women lead in the early 1900's are truly eye opening. They face prejudice and lack of control in their own lives that very few deal with today. The cast of The Color Purple is a very diverse one indeed, and has a wonderful array of talented actors to offer. I also believe that the choice to cast Oprah Winfrey as Sofia was very wise, as today she has become one of the most influential black women in the world. The film score is another element to this movie that I feel was very powerful. Quincy Jones did a remarkable job of strengthening the most powerful moments in the film, as well as beautifully complimenting the course of events throughout the story. I believe that most films are practically useless without music to back the action and this film is a perfect portrayal of that principal. All in all, the story that is portrayed in this film is truly moving and quite honestly somewhat disturbing at times, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a heartfelt drama focused on overcoming adversity that wasn't though possible to overcome.

The startling feeding frenzy of the vampires toward the end of the movie easily represents evil that has run rampant in a spiritually barren world.Perhaps the director and screenwriter are taking on too much, but this is a compelling movie--dark, grim, and intense.

This classic film has left a lasting impact on audiences for several decades, and will continue to do so for several more decades. But what is it about this movie that makes it so special? The answer to this question lies in the memorable characters and thought provoking story.The characters of To Kill a Mockingbird are some of the most beloved characters in the history of cinema. Gregory Peck gives an incredible Oscar winning performance as Atticus Finch, a lawyer who decides to defend an African American man he believes to be unjustly charged with a crime due to racial prejudice. Atticus Finch has been called the Greatest Movie Hero of All Time by the American Film Institute, and it is obvious why. Atticus not only makes a stand against discrimination at a time when racism was common, but he is arguably the greatest father figure in movie history as well. This is Peck's most iconic role of his career and he pulls it off brilliantly.The same can be said about the performances of both Mary Bedham and Phillip Alford as Scout and Jem Finch, Atticus' children. These two actors gave some of the best and most believable performances I have ever seen from child actors. When watching the film, I did not see child actors playing roles, I saw real children because of the way Bedham and Alford encompassed the mannerisms and speech you see from real children. This adds so much to the film as a majority of the story is presented to the audience from the perspective of Scout Finch. And Robert Duvall's performance? Talk about a performance that leaves an impact! What I personally love about To Kill A Mockingbird is that while the film does tackle the issue of racism, it offers so much more. Any film can throw a simplistic Racism is bad message at an audience, but To Kill a Mockingbird decides to show an innocent and naive child's perspective of her father's stand against prejudice and the intense opposition it brings. The audience grows and learns alongside Scout as she watches Atticus hold firm to what he believes in, despite the fact that many of his peers hate him for it.The pure and real relationship Atticus has with both of his children adds so much to the film as well. A specific scene in which Atticus is tucking Scout in is one of the most intimate and believable scenes between a parent and a child I have ever seen on film. I could have sworn Gregory Peck was Mary Bedham's actual father because of how amazing their chemistry was. Yeah, it is that good.To Kill A Mockingbird is a timeless classic that absolutely must be seen by everyone at some point in their lives. No film has ever made such an impact on me on such a personal level. That combined with excellent film making is why To Kill a Mockingbird is my favorite film of all time.
