It's a good film ONCE IT GETS GOING, but thats like after an hour and by that time you've either fallen asleep or noticed that your shoes could do with a clean. The whole planet thing blowing up, baby goes to earth, Clark learning his powers blah blah blah I DON'T CARE is way to long. I mean it takes other films only a couple of scenes to tell the background of the hero. This film took 14 scenes for f**ks sake! Even after that, it was still annoying, but only a few scenes, however. The whole 'can you read my mind?' thing. BORING!! I nearly fell asleep for the seventh time and had realised that my shoes really did need a clean. Has anyone noticed as well, when Superman spins the earth around to go back in time, what happens to the seas and moon's gravity? (A tedious point but one I felt had nothing to with this review. Just like jam!) The casting was good (finally a positive comment) and everyone suited their roles.Gene Hackman as Lex was brilliant and the guy who played superman was... zzzz. Whhhaaa? Oh sorry, just thinking about this film made me fall asleep. Look, if you've got a couple of spare hours and like self torture, watch this film. If you don't, don't watch it. Now, where's that shoe cleaner?
