Every morning it's the same thing he sits in traffic for an hour or so then he finally arrives at his place of employment a large, heartless corporation known as Initech. Then, Peter sits at his computer in his cubicle prison and there he sits for the rest of the day. Peter's friends find work dull also. There's Michael Bolton, who is not named after the singer it is just a coincidence, and Samir Nagheenanajar, whose last name nobody could pronounce. Today, Peter is given a hard time by office supervisors Bill Lumbergh and Dom Portwood because Peter forgot to put a cover sheet on his TPS reports. Michael and Samir deal with a faulty copier. Another mistreated employee of Initech was mumbling, bumbling Milton Waddams. Soft-spoken, patronizing Bill Lumbergh always seemed to complicate his life by asking him to move his desk, and all Milton could do was stutter, and threaten to set fire to the building; Peter's girlfriend Anne takes him to see an occupational hypnotherapist, Dr. Swanson. He puts Peter in a trance of complete relaxation, but suddenly collapses from a heart attack before he can reverse the process. Peter felt great for the first time in a long time. He didn't have a care in the world. Not even when Anne broke up with him. Lumbergh had asked him to come in during the weekend, but Peter just slept the whole time. He went down to Chotchkie's, where a pretty waitress whom Peter had a crush on worked. Her name was Joanna. The two of them grab lunch at the place next door; Peter waltzes into the office early Monday morning, right when some consultants were interviewing employees, due to they were on a downsizing committee. Already they had canned Tom Smykowski, another friend of Peter's. Plus, they were going to let Michael Bolton and Samir go too, but when they met with Peter, still under the trance, he is incredible honest and open with the interviewers Bob Slydell and Bob Porter. They saw he was real executive material. Peter was stoked about the promotion, but upset that his friends got fired; Lumbergh makes Milton move his desk against the wall, and he swipes Milton's favorite stapler, claiming it's his; Peter, Michael and Samir plot together to get even with Initech, once and for all. Michael had a computer virus he had been working on. Once implanted in the company's network, it would deduct fractions of a cent off the company's profits and transfer them into another account. In just a few years, the guys could make over $100,000. They go for it.Peter, Michael and Samir upload the virus then stroll out of the building; Tom Smykowski got into an automobile accident and was crippled, but got a huge cash settlement. He threw a barbecue to celebrate. It was there that Peter found out that Joanna slept with Lumbergh. Ron Lumbergh actually, not Bill. But Peter thought it was Bill. He and Joanna have a fight and they break up. Worse yet, Peter checks his account balance and sees he is now $305,000 richer. The virus worked TOO well; Milton had to move his desk down to Storage Room B, and worse yet, today was Lumbergh's 41st birthday and everybody got a piece of cake, except for Milton; The guys were in a real jam. Peter decided to just confess and face the music. Initech accounting had discovered the problem, so that night, Peter slips a confession letter underneath Lumbergh's door, and goes to Chotchkie's to make up with Joanna. She had stood up to her boss, got fired, and got a better job at the place next door; In the morning, Milton had an appointment with Lumbergh and when Peter arrived at Initech to fess up, the whole building was engulfed in flames. Milton had made good his threat. So, Peter and the guys were off the hook. It was a happy ending for all. Peter got a job at a construction outfit with his neighbor, Lawrence, as they clear up the wreckage that was once Initech. Michael and Samir got jobs at Initrode, and Milton got a vacation to the Bahamas, where he saw himself being played for a fool...Again.Well, Office Space. It's a good movie. It's funny. It's directed by Mike Judge, who as you know, created Beavis & Butt-head, and co-created King of the Hill. Both are good shows. Office Space is based on some 1991 animated shorts produced by Judge, featuring Milton and Lumbergh; Ron Livingston is Peter, David Herman is Michael Bolton, Ajay Naidu is Samir, Diedrich Bader is Lawrence, Gary Cole is Lumbergh, Jennifer Aniston is Joanna, John C. McGinley is Bob, Paul Willson is Bob, and Stephen Root is Milton. Mike Judge even has a cameo in this movie as the manager at Chotchkie's who gives Joanna a hard time about her pieces of flair. David Herman and Stephen Root do voices on King of the Hill. Everybody is good in their roles, and very funny. So if you have a job you don't like, you'll know what these guys are going through. This movie is a sentimental look at office workers and it's not the dream job they all thought it would be. So if you like Mike Judge or anyone in this movie, then I recommend Office Space. If there's ever a sequel, we can see the further adventures of Milton.
