This is the first time I have gone to a movie and actually become ANGRY watching a comedy. I only thank god I did not pay to see this. And look I am dumbing this movie down on the Adam Sander level. I have not expected much from Adam Sandler movies.. I have NOTHING against the guy.I mean I like Adam Sandler. I just find his movies OK.. but leave it to him to not even reach the absolutely 1 one millionth of an inch bar that has been set. If reaching the bar for this movie was a inch high.. he would be digging under ground for 2 miles.Trying to describe the movie does not do its futility justice. No words, phrases, interpolative dances or biblical scrawling have yet to be invented to describe the absolute time decaying event that is sitting through this film. I only watched it because I knew that i was truly in the moment of history.. a cinematic event on the level of the Hindenburg crashing.Its seemed as if the four horsemen of the Apocalypse rode through the screen laughing and exalting your every minute as you sat through each frame decaying frame after another. If films had a smell, this film would reek of absolute desolation and despair. If failure had a smell it would be this film. I looked at it in wonder as if why would someone put this train wreck on film..why because we are someone what drawn to human tragedy.. well I cant answer those question.. Biblical scholars and Pyscholgist can better explain the deep corners of the mind that this film tends to attack.In closing NO FILM can try to be as bad as little Nicky .. films can only come close to being as bad as this film was. we have hit the Rosetta stone of absolute cinematic failure..And hopefully those of us who have seen it came away without having our eyes bleed and our bodies turned to stone. And for that reason if you want to see the benchmark for futility.. you should see this film.. just so you can know how bad a film can be. Thank god I survived....or did i?

In the light of todays average fair full of pounding soundtracks, pyrotechnics, and product placements, it almost seems like a thinking mans film, however, this type of story telling has an inherent birth defect due to the very nature of its design, and that is that once you've seen it, the films one true claim of quality is forever lost, the carpet can not be pulled out from under your feet a second time. In essence, it becomes as pointless as trying to dazzle yourself at a magic show when you already know all the secrets behind every trick. Outside of this built in defect there is also the problem that the trick itself is actually very badly designed in the first place, this is in reality a very poorly constructed, and badly written script. This film has been embraced and awarded the highest honors, and yet there is not a single moment in it that isn't bogged down and convoluted, or even one bit plausible.At the end of the film the other cop who works in the office where Verbal Kent is interrogated tells Inspector Kujan ( Chazz Palminteri )that to basically understand his messy office, you just have to stand back and look at it to see it, the same exact thing can be said about this equally unorganized film. To truly understand this lets stand back and actually take a look at the character of Keaton, played very dully by the very dull Gabriel Byrne. He was a NYPD officer for 4 years even though he is a Brit. In that short time he spent on the force he committed seven felonies, three of which were murders. Not a single one of these crimes could be pinned on him because the witnesses either died or changed their stories entirely, yet as an obvious embarrassment to the department, he was kicked off the force. When he is off the Force he gets indited on a fraud charge and does five years in prison. While in prison he kills three fellow inmates, but just like his other crimes, none of these atrocities could be pinned on him, so he simply gets out when his time is up. Once on the streets he kills yet again, but before he could be prosecuted for it, he dies in a warehouse fire when he goes in to check a leaking gas main. Once dead, the two witnesses that could of railroaded him back to Sing Sing die in single mysterious deaths, and even though there are no longer any witnesses left breathing, an innocent man takes his place behind bars. So now he surfaces as a business man who dates a high priced criminal lawyer. Thats his story folks, told to you specifically to get you to buy that he is this arch super-villain with the ridiculously bad name. Meanwhile this film does all it can to paint Verbal Kent as a bumbling idiotic club footed buffoon con man. The problem with all this blatant manipulation is that Kevin Spacey might as well have the name Keser Soze stenciled across forehead in bright neon letters.Another place this film falls short is in its attempt to be a two fisted tough guy movie, lets face it, the only female character that even has a name, is simply in the movie as a reason to move the protagonist like pawns on a chest board at convenient times in this contorted plot, so what we are left with is the five criminals, who like small grade school children, spend half the movie puffing their chests out at one another. One scene that never fails to get a good laugh out of me is when Kevin Pollack and Stephen Baldwin almost get into a fight with one another. Possibly for reasons of keeping both men in the frame, director Bryan Singer has these two guys standing toe to toe facing one another with their mouths only a few inches apart, instead of looking like a fisticuff might take place, it looks far more likely that they might engage in a lusty soul kiss. This nice moment is capped of by brilliantly by a disembodied macho voice calling them ladies, and Kevin Pollack asking the Baldwin brother if he wants to dance. The fun continues in a later scene in which the Baldwin character comes up behind Pete Postlethwaite as if he might mount him any second, and whispers in his ear I'm the guy thats gonna get you. Yes, due to inept story tellers and bad dialogue, what might of been Clint Eastwoon like one liners, is reduced in the hands of these hacks, into homoeroticism running wild.I know that audiences continue to be impressed by this film, and that this thing won an Oscar for its script, but this story is nothing but a clunky ludicrous mess wrapped up in a bow of paper thin phony freshness, it simply does not deserve all of the love it is getting. The Usual Suspects is a film that makes me want to quit my day job and move to Hollywood, since tripe is so often confused with genius.

Double Impact has great fight scenes including Van Damme against Bolo Yeung, also in Bloodsport. It has Plenty of violence, packed with good laughs.

The bright colors, vivid scenery and outlandish characterization are trademarks of Luhrmann's style, and I for one think that it is cinematography at its best. He brings us into the world of Shakespeare in a way no one else has. I saw this movie in the theater when I was 11 and it prompted me to buy the play and ever since then I have been in love with it. I appreciate Baz's attempt at aiming the story to a younger audience. You don't find many kids these days (or ten years ago...has it really been that long??) who want to willingly read Shakespeare. The language is complicated and unfamiliar. But the stories are worth knowing, and I think this movie is a step forward in familiarizing Shakespeare to the modern times.There are plenty of people who disagree with the use to Shakespeare's dialogue in the modern setting. I have argued this point over and over and this is what I have to say to them It seems that someone who appreciates Shakespeare would want his brilliant words to be used. You see the movie and you think Baz Luhrmann, you hear the dialogue and you think William Shakespeare. If you are someone who can't understand Shakespeare, the makers of the film dedicated themselves to finding ways, by using imagery, to decode the language and make it more understandable.I've often heard complaints about the acting in this movie as well. I for one don't see anything wrong with the acting, and I thought the cast did very well with the difficult dialogue. I've always been a fan of Leonardo Dicaprio. Back when I first saw this movie, it was just because I thought he was cute. But now, I see an actor who plays his roles with intensity and passion. He is the perfect Romeo to me. He portrays the passionate, lovesick lead incredibly well. We see his heart break on the screen when Mercutio is slain, and again when he learns of Juliet's death. We see his all-consuming rage when he is chasing after Tybalt to avenge his friend's death. We see a boy falling in love with a girl and wanting to be with her for the rest of his life. He goes though all of these emotions seamlessly, and in the end, you really don't want this guy to die.Claire Danes as Juliet impressed me as well. She has a much less flashy role than Leo, but she brings strong character to the innocent, angelic young woman. My favorite parts with her were when she was alone, speaking to herself. I really thought she did the dialogue very well, and she is often who I think of when I read the play. She handles the emotional stuff with experience, and you are left there wishing you could do something for this girl who goes through so much in such a short time.My favorite character in the movie has to be Meructio, played by Harold Perrineau. He's loud, flamboyant, and I can't get enough of him when he is on the screen. He even dresses in drag at the costume party where Romeo and Juliet meet, and lip-syncs to Young Hearts Run Free. He plays the loyal friend with feeling, and it is very disappointing when he meets his end.This movie definitely isn't for everyone. Some people just can't quite grasp what Luhrmann was trying to accomplish with this movie. He wasn't trying to do a replica of the play or the movies made before it. It's different. It's daring. Some parts might just make you laugh out loud. But the tragedy of the story is still very much there.In my opinion, this movie is something to be appreciated. It steps out of the norm and pulls you into a world of love and tragedy with its intense delivery and unique portrayal of a timeless story.

We see his all-consuming rage when he is chasing after Tybalt to avenge his friend's death. We see a boy falling in love with a girl and wanting to be with her for the rest of his life. He goes though all of these emotions seamlessly, and in the end, you really don't want this guy to die.Claire Danes as Juliet impressed me as well. She has a much less flashy role than Leo, but she brings strong character to the innocent, angelic young woman. My favorite parts with her were when she was alone, speaking to herself. I really thought she did the dialogue very well, and she is often who I think of when I read the play. She handles the emotional stuff with experience, and you are left there wishing you could do something for this girl who goes through so much in such a short time.My favorite character in the movie has to be Meructio, played by Harold Perrineau. He's loud, flamboyant, and I can't get enough of him when he is on the screen. He even dresses in drag at the costume party where Romeo and Juliet meet, and lip-syncs to Young Hearts Run Free. He plays the loyal friend with feeling, and it is very disappointing when he meets his end.This movie definitely isn't for everyone. Some people just can't quite grasp what Luhrmann was trying to accomplish with this movie. He wasn't trying to do a replica of the play or the movies made before it. It's different. It's daring. Some parts might just make you laugh out loud. But the tragedy of the story is still very much there.In my opinion, this movie is something to be appreciated. It steps out of the norm and pulls you into a world of love and tragedy with its intense delivery and unique portrayal of a timeless story.

The bright colors, vivid scenery and outlandish characterization are trademarks of Luhrmann's style, and I for one think that it is cinematography at its best. He brings us into the world of Shakespeare in a way no one else has. I saw this movie in the theater when I was 11 and it prompted me to buy the play and ever since then I have been in love with it. I appreciate Baz's attempt at aiming the story to a younger audience. You don't find many kids these days (or ten years ago...has it really been that long??) who want to willingly read Shakespeare. The language is complicated and unfamiliar. But the stories are worth knowing, and I think this movie is a step forward in familiarizing Shakespeare to the modern times.There are plenty of people who disagree with the use to Shakespeare's dialogue in the modern setting. I have argued this point over and over and this is what I have to say to them It seems that someone who appreciates Shakespeare would want his brilliant words to be used. You see the movie and you think Baz Luhrmann, you hear the dialogue and you think William Shakespeare. If you are someone who can't understand Shakespeare, the makers of the film dedicated themselves to finding ways, by using imagery, to decode the language and make it more understandable.I've often heard complaints about the acting in this movie as well. I for one don't see anything wrong with the acting, and I thought the cast did very well with the difficult dialogue. I've always been a fan of Leonardo Dicaprio.

There are thousands of actors with one little ear piece. But there is one specifically. Truman's best friend since kindergarten and the one Truman trusts the most is Marlon. But Marlon is also the one who has to lie the most. Even though he doesn't want to he does. One of the most ironic quotes from the movie was said by Marlon as he talked to Truman. This is what he said  Truman the last thing I would ever do is lie to you. As I look at all of the personal and public things Truman has said or done, I disagree with Christoff's view of the world.In the dome that Truman's life is taking place, Truman is the only thing that is real. In the dome, there are more than 4,999 big and small cameras. Which, are placed all over the little town with lights and speakers. It is a little scary that everywhere you go someone is always watching you. At the beginning of the movie one of the lights fall from the very top of the dome so far up you can't even see it. Of course on the radio the next day they announce a plane was losing parts while flying through the air. Lucky for the studio and Christoff, Truman believes it. As for me I would become suspicious.Christoff, working as the main producer is a very smart guy. He really knows how to make a really good show. A very thoughtful quote from Christoff was, We accept the reality of the world with which we are presented. Meaning, every problem, every speed bump we hit we will over come because we can deal with what we know we can handle. I think that this statement is a very true one, because if you are really set to some thing you can overcome any obstacles because this is what you really want.

Truman replies with a cheesy answer Yeah, well, I can understand that, I'm a pretty dangerous character. Lauren is determined to tell Truman the truth about his life. As Lauren takes Truman to the beach to tell him the truth she begins to tell him that they are coming for her so they need to talk fast. She also tells him her real name is Sylvia and that she is an actor and so is every one else and that his life is real but his reality isn't. For me, I agree with Lauren\/Sylvia, if I were in her shoes I would tell Truman as well. A car comes rolling in. Her father jumps out and tells Truman they are moving to Fiji. As Truman grows older, he becomes determined to move to Fiji!Truman, as determined as he is, goes to a travel agent to book a flight to Fiji. He sees tons of warnings and safety precautions of why NOT to fly on airplanes. They say we can book a flight for you in July next year. Fiji is very popular.

Watching L&B again after 3+ years, I was reminded of why I absolutely fell in LOVE with it in the first place. So many things that Monica and Q experienced in each Quarter of the movie brought back memories of my own high school and college experiences. In many ways, L&B was a coming-of-age movie for me. (Not to mention that the soundtrack is a fabulous trip down musical memory-lane). L&B is a poignant and touching modern story love story that follows the evolving lives and love of two young African-American athletes, as they navigate through the complications and changes thrown at them as they mature into adulthood. Sanaa Lathan is a standout in this movie. As always, with consummate ease, she infuses humanness and sincerity in to every character she plays. The on-screen chemistry between Sanaa and Omar is so perfect it just tugs at your heartstrings. It turns out they were a real-life couple around the time the movie was filmed\/released, but real-life romance does not always guarantee on-screen chemistry (just look at Eyes Wide Shut with Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise). Fortunately, Sanaa and Omar's real-life chemistry came across wonderfully on screen. I think that the first love scene between Monica and Q is one of the most beautiful, touching, and tastefully done scenes of its kind in film. I NEVER cry at movies, and I was a little misty-eyed at the end--not typical for a love scene. Also, the second-to-last scene where Monica and Q play basketball one-on-one for Q's heart--accompanied by a spot-on track by Meshell Ndegeocello--brought a tear or two to my eyes. L&B is a classic love story, but it deftly manages to avoid triteness or unoriginality by giving the viewer subtle glimpses into several of life's realities as they impact Monica and Q. The marked disparity in opportunities for male and female athletes underscores the entire movie, and we get an inside look as Monica invests sweat and tears pursuing her dream. We also see the sacrifices and strength of both Monica and some of the supporting female characters in the movie, such as Monica and Q's mothers, and Monica's teammates. I loved the ending of this movie as well. By giving the audience a positive glimpse into the future, L&B delivered the happy ending that we've come to expect from romantic movies, without being corny, overly-sappy or unrealistic.

And, I suppose, Bookdock saints was cool, but it was NOT a great movie, in my opinion.The thing I liked best about Boondock Saints was its portrait of three central characters (the twins and Rocco) who really made no distinction in their own minds between real life and movies. I loved the bit with the brothers using the ventilation shaft to enter a hotel room, and of Rocco thinking he's Wyatt Earp, wielding two handguns to blast his victims. The whole idea of vigilante justice, of course, is intertwined with media representations of crime, justice, and violence in our culture. The movie was at its best when it immersed itself in this weird postmodern hyper-reality.I think the movie falls short of greatness because the filmmakers are just not that good. In a funny, ironic way, I think the filmmakers are almost exactly like the MacManus brothers. Like the Saints, the filmmakers scrabble together a lot of really cool things they've seen in movies like The Usual Suspects, True Romance, and Tarantino's films, and because they're imitating and remixing cool source material, they sometimes succeed in creating some cool cinema. Like the Saints, the filmmakers here are well-intentioned and lovable, but maybe not all that competent, when it comes down to it. After watching the whole movie, I don't get the sense that there's a strong central vision or real coherence to the movie. Although the idea is solid, the dialogue is less-than-stellar, and the cinematography sometimes makes the film look like a made-for-TV movie. Still, to the extent that Troy Duffy is the auteur here, it's not at all bad for a directorial debut. I'd probably see a follow-up, if there ever is one (not a sequel--God forbid; that would be a really misguided venture--what I mean is that I'd see a sophomore directorial effort by Duffy).I enjoyed Boondock Saints, but boy am I ever glad I rented it from Netflix instead of impulse buying the DVD! Did I use the word cool a lot in this review? I think that's significant, actually. I just get the sense that Duffy is far more interested in making a cool movie than in making good cinema. A great movie, in my opinion, might be able to do both at once!
