I like plays, also, so these components were fine. The movie is a bit weak at first in developing characters; we have to assume a lot about how likeable the protagonists are (which makes it hard to be terribly upset if they die-- we just don't know them well enough). On the other hand, this is an utterly unique topic. The Holocaust is often thought of as a strictly Jewish Holocaust and, while European Jews bore the huge brunt of its terror, Catholics, communists, Roma (Gypsies), Slavs, and homosexuals were also a part of it. In that sense, this movie has an extremely important message because it focuses our attention not only on the oppression of homosexuals per se but also on the nature of the Holocaust as it happened in 1930s\/40s Europe. On this basis, it's a very worthwhile film. I look very forward to other films on this theme that this one has opened the door for, too.

I am a Christian and I have always thought that if a real Hollywood type movie could be made about the end times, then it would be very entertaining and very frightening, even if you don't believe the Bible. I still have that belief, but this definitely wasn't the movie that will entertain and frighten people, on the contrary it will make people confused and probably laugh a lot. I know it wasn't a Hollywood movie, but it did cost about 7 million dollars to make, and that is low budget, but I have seen movies that cost less, and were much better. This one had sub par acting, a horrible musical score that sounded like it was done entirely on a keyboard, and a script that seemed like it was done by people who have had little experience with screen writing. It was extremely confusing to me, and I have some knowledge of Revelation and Daniel, so I can imagine how confusing it would be to someone who has little or no experience with those books at all. Obviously too much of the budget was spent on the effects (and they weren't that great), and not on getting good screen writers and good actors. Overall, very disappointing.
