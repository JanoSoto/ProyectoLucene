What neat things will I find in my stocking as I sneak downstairs to look in it? What will be in the next present that I open? Will I or won't I glimpse Santa sneaking around my living room? The greatest surprise of all is realizing that the little babe born in the manger is really the creator of the cosmos and of the very manger he is sleeping in.The Parent Trap is like Christmas. It brings smiles, joys and surprises. Imagine going away to summer camp when you discover someone who looks exactly like you standing in the lunch line. Who are they? And why do they have your face? You mean we have the same birthday? You mean we have the same parents? WERE SIBLINGS!!! What would you do in a situation like this? Why switch places with your newly discovered sibling of course.This film has as much intrigue as a James Bond film and as much mystery as an Agatha Christie novel, as the twins plot to get their divorced parents back together. It's great to have a film so blatantly say 'Divorce Really Sucks (the life out of families) And the Sixth Sense style surprises continue to show up throughout the film as the parents and those in the households on each side of the continent realize that the person they thought was one twin really was the other one.Sometimes when the revelation is revealed in a story, the interest level seems to flatten in the storyline, but not in this film. It maintains a high level of interest throughout the film. It's also interesting to note that in that the high quality special effects that were used in the picture were done in an age before computers were as sophisticated as they are today. It is really convincing that there are two Hayley Mills on the screen at the same time. I once did shot the same person on tape using two different hair styles and made it look like she was talking to herself as a different person. It's way cool to do if you know how to do that sort of thing. I also shot myself doing the 'Who's on First' routine.The movie has few flaws if any. At times I had trouble telling the two characters apart but that may be me and is not enough to mention as a real flaw. Some of the characters smoke cigarettes in plain view of children. I mean the horror of it. Overall I think cigarettes stink and are bad for children but I am not a smoking Nazi who would sponge all cigarettes from older films. There are some who would actually do this.Another neat little thing is how they talk about sexuality without actually talking about it. The innocence of a family friendly film is still intact with the reality of the meaning of sexuality and martial love weaved into the seams of the film. All of the actors are a delight to spend two hours with especially Hayley and the guy who played the minister. You also get to witness Hayley kicking the crap out of herself. It's rare you see a good girl fight on film. It's sexist that only men kick the crap out of each other and never women.Part of the reason I loved this film as much as I did in my reviewing of it, is because I was impressed and pleased that Disney could produce such a high quality, mature looking film. This film is not just good for Disney, its' a good film in general. Any Disney slapstick happens as a result of the story and not as a result to just get laughs.This is not worth a rental, it's worth buying and keeping and sharing with loved ones. Rent it by all means if you don't have the money to buy it. This film is Pure Movie Magic. Disney Gold A warning Don't be tempted to watch the sequel that is on the same DVD disc, it's bad as the original is good. If the original is Charismas, the sequel is Tax Day eve.

They lack of two basic things, originality and being fun. And what a coincidence! because those are both of the mayor elements that makes Grease such a great movie. Released in 1978, Grease left a mayor print in the whole world. Well, there are many movies that have done that, so why does Grease stand out more? Honestly, because the film wasn't that good.I mean think about it. What is the plot in this movie? a guy that spends his whole high school year trying to get back together with his summer love while doing annoying things along the way. Not much of a plot is it? And the moral? being a jerk who gets into fights, ignores his friends and doesn't do anything at school will help you turn your summer crush into a smoking cool girl who ends up with you in the end despite all the times you tried to get into her panties? Not a very great moral, in fact, most of High School based movies usually have the cool guys being the bad guys and in the end they lose. So by now you might be saying, How can you say at that this movie is great and then trash its plot and moral? Well, if I may continue, I'd have to say that the greatest thing about this movie, is that you don't really care for the plot or the moral. You watch this movie, and you have FUN!The songs are great, the dancing is great, the humour is great and you'd think that without a plot the movie could be impossible to watch, but no; you are so entertained while watching Grease that you wouldn't care if someone's child dies in the middle of the film. By the way, for all of you who haven't seen the movie, that doesn't happen.Yes it's very corny, the actors that are suppose to be in their teen years look like they're thirty and the character development is not very deep. But I'll say it again, you WON'T CARE! and that is why this movie is considered to be one of the best musicals of all time. It manages to take the incredibly picky movie critics out of us and makes us sing and dance along with it, WITHOUT COMPLAINING!!Nowadays, directors have tried to create a musical which has the same power as Grease. Most of them have failed miserably to try and hide the lack of plot or horrible acting, leaving them as cinema failures who only the eight year old girls will like.

I decided to revisit this masterpiece after I paged through Nick Hornby's novel that inspired this Chicago filmed classic.It is unbelievable that movies can sometimes just hit you and let you know that other people have experienced exactly what you're feeling (probably one billion times before, like even cavemen looked at their girlfriends once or twice and said, that's it, eh?). Most people will take this as a movie about breaking up (but it's not), and lots of people just see this move as a chick-flick for dudes (but it sort of is). It's the greatest dude-flick of all time (if you count Terminator 2 and The Matrix as guy movies and say Swingers as another dude flick).Being a business owner in his mid-twenties who used to live in the same neighborhood Championship Vinyl was in skews my opinion a bit, but I have to say that the movie is about growing up in the twentieth century. We're not supposed to be married at twenty-one anymore and that creates a lot of time to mess up our relationships and turn into jaded, pessimistic, intelligent, nerds. Cusack is so believable in this role, and you like this character so much that you find yourself defending his flaws in your own mind. He creates a character that allows the viewer to suspend judgment. I suddenly find myself scanning through the minutia of my own hobbies looking for the smallest details to enjoy. Few movies make you think about them after they're long done, but I make constant correlations to myself and Rob as much as possible. It becomes a parable to live by.It gets a nine because the ending isn't perfect. Most of the time I turn the movie off right when the girl comes in to give him an interview.

Akira Kurosawa's 1954 black and white film Seven Samurai (Shichinin no samurai) is one of them. It was well deserving of winning the 1954 Venice Film Festival's Silver Lion, as well as the two Academy awards it won for Best Art\/Set Decoration and Best Costume Design. On a first view it's simply a great action film, but with subsequent viewings the finer points of characterization come through in each moment, seeping into the mind subliminally and purposefully. The story, at nearly three and a half hours in length- including a five minute intermission, is never weighted down with fat, as all of the many subplots bear fruit- so unlike most films made in Hollywood today. It became an international sensation, and the highest grossing Japanese film of its day.Yes, there are remnants of the stale samurai genre, such as the wise man Kambei Shimada (Takashi Shimura), and the 'boy on the verge of manhood' in Katsushiro Okamoto (Isao 'Ko' Kimura), and his romance with farmer Manzo's daughter Shino, but the central human dilemma of the 16th Century farmers who are helpless against the depredations of the bandits, who abound during the civil wars of the era, raises the film above mere clichés. We only see the bandits at the beginning and end of the film. There are about two hours where the meat of the tale takes place, and not a bandit is in sight. How many films do away with their bad guys for so long? How many could afford to? Since we do not know any of the bandits' names, they are more like a singular character, or a sheer force of nature. Why do they keep coming to attack the villagers, even as their forces are successively thinned with each failed raid? They must realize that the once helpless villagers have hired defenders? There is no Darth Vader among the bandits, despite George Lucas's latter-day attempts to cite this film as an influence for his banal and downright puerile Star Wars saga. We also learn that the villagers are neither as poor nor innocent as they portray. There are murderers amongst them, who have killed samurai before. They also seek to lowball and underpay their protectors&#133;. It is a truism that almost all great directors have at least one great collaborator. With Ingmar Bergman it was his cinematographer Sven Nykvist. With Federico Fellini it was his musical scorer, Nino Rota. But with Kurosawa it's not only great stars like Mifune and Shimura, but his co-writers, Shinobu Hashimoto and Hideo Oguni- part of a rotating staff of writers that muted some of Kurosawa's own admitted over the top tendencies in storytelling, and brought the tale down to a human level. Without them the film may have been little more than a greatly stylized genre film, rather than a great film, period.The cinematography Asakazu Nakai, and score by Fumio Hayasaka are also very good, although this is an actor-driven vehicle. Nakai's deep focus techniques- at the time cutting edge, are every bit as good as those in Citizen Kane. Especially, look at the complexity of the many crowd scenes, where many little stories play out as we watch the foregrounded action of the samurai. Things like this are only gotten on repeated viewings, and with my second viewing I picked up much more than on a first glance, especially while not having to read the subtitles. And look at how jungle twigs seem to leap out at the viewer, as does Mifune's huge phallic sword as he slings it over his shoulder. The whole film was shot in a 1.331 aspect ratio, so one wonders what Kurosawa would have done with this film in widescreen.There's no doubt that Seven Samurai is a great film, and with its length and complexity it will only grow in my estimation as I view it more and more over the years. Of that I'm sure. But, that said, I do not think that it is Kurosawa's best film. I'd still lean toward Ikiru for that honor- for it's simply the more deeply human tale, and Shimura is even better in his role as Watanabe the doomed bureaucrat than as Kambei the indefatigable warrior. However, this is the granddaddy of all great action films, from Sam Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch to even James Cameron's films like Aliens or The Terminator series, as well as a great bildungsroman for Katsushiro. It also struck me, as the film opens to drumbeats, how reminiscent this film's opening is to that of my beloved Godzilla- a film that was released in the same year, with the footfalls of the monster dominating a black screen filled with credits. While Godzilla is nowhere in a league to Seven Samurai as a film, it is the second most influential Japanese film of all time. That both rely on such primal sounds in their openings makes one wonder if there's a connection.Yet, the thing that Seven Samurai has that few other films do is its incredibly detailed richness. From the bad skull caps the male characters wear, to the ambush tests Kambei devises to recruit his cohorts, to the old woman who goes to kill a hobbled bandit with a farm instrument- to avenge her son's death, and many others; all of these and more make repeated viewing a necessity to truly appreciate this film, for all of these things are non-essential to the basic plot, even as they heighten the realism of this unreal tale. Let me end by stating that Seven Samurai is every bit as good, and great, as its greatest champions claim, and I ask you, how rare a thing is that?

Heck the trailer gives it away too. But I came into this movie with absolutely no idea what it was about. I was curious to watch the movie because it was referenced as Kafka Esquire. I'm just into the whole not seeing beyond the obvious type of movies. That and it was no.8 on IMDb's list of Kafka Esquire movies. The title definitely clued me in on what type of mood I would be in though. There were hardly any daytime sequences, except for that surrealistic last scene. Unlike most other movies, the dark nature of the movie actually is part of the plot itself and I found that; absolutely refreshing. Dark City is quite an experience in itself and even though it has its faults, mainly in its plot like most movie of its genre, it still doesn't take away from feelings it will create.The movie opens with fairly ominous overtones. The city looks bleak and you can feel something bad is going to happen. As it turns out, our moral senses are tingling. Our man, John Murdock, wakes up inside a chillingly lit bath tub full of water with blood on his face and a dead body on the floor. He gets phone call telling him to get out of there and quickly he does. His departure reveals a world that sleeps at once but carries on without notice. Our fugitive is being chased by overtly pale white men in trench coats. Their means are as menacing as their looks.At first they seem creepy but then soon they're revealed to be much more powerful. There in lies the first problem and that is that their threat is madly inconsistent. One minute they're shadowy men that lurks in the environment, and the next, they can not only fly but build the environment itself. Furthermore they can put the whole world to sleep at will as part of an experiment. How they can put drivers to sleep and not cause crashes is amusing though. Anyway, with this kind of power, what isn't within their reach? Well, apparently John. But that's because he has small powers himself; and even though he escapes with luck and timing, you get a sense that these omnipotent beings aren't quite as threatening as they first appeared. On that point, they aren't really a threat to mankind itself but rather just manipulative observers. And give credit to the film-makers for immersing us in that situation. We get glimpses into the confusion of what it's like to be a rat in an experiment. How cruel it is to see the people trying to explore why they can't remember past what is shown to us in the screen. It's quite depressing. At the same time, we can empathize with the Strangers for their curiosity to study us. Should a distant race happen upon Earth, it is reasonable to assume they would just pluck us up from our every day lives just to find out what makes us tick. What emotions do we have? What do we feel? What is our soul? Of course there isn't time to answer those questions as there's virtually no down time. In moments of character interplay, there is an underlying sense of dread in the air. When the characters aren't being introspective, the action itself is quite enjoyable. All the physical interaction is within the boundaries of the plot except when it comes to the climactic end battle. That's where it really shows its year of production. I can't really fault the movie just because I saw it a decade later. Although I did find it unnecessary within the confines of the plot. The movie set the tone as an intelligent sci-fi thriller. Most movies of this type tends to cross over to the action genre for it's climax so that is expected. Of course where it faltered slightly there it ended strongly in familiar fashion. Yes the hero now controls the world. He's the bad-ass and he wants the girl, let him have his glory in the sun and for us, the visual payout was just as welcoming. It ends on an excellent note, visually and metaphorically. By the end, the inability for the Strangers to catch Murdock can be explained away in logistical terms; a city is bigger than a maze. While I'm reflecting back on faults, I just want to talk about the physics. It's just off the wall. The water moves to nonexistent weather; there's wind suck-age by space wall even though they're surround by a force field; the detective doesn't expand once in space; and finally the hull of the ship is held by bricks! This is all hindsight nitpicking of course, as none of this hindered the sensation I felt as some of the situation unfolds. The sun creeping over the city was beautiful; the detective floating out to space, a sad lost; the water pouring out of the city, majestic; and looking at space through a brick wall; a hauntingly disturbing visual. So for me, even when logic eventually catches up to you, it still doesn't take away from the awe-inspiring magic this movie can drop on you in the moment. It might hinder future viewings but then again, when you associate a feeling with a certain scene, that feeling will probably be there on repeated viewings. On this single viewing though, I found the movie to be sci-fi at its best with its thought provoking premise, tensely choreograph moments, and well-conceived visuals. Even with its subtle flaws I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Yes the hero now controls the world. He's the bad-ass and he wants the girl, let him have his glory in the sun and for us, the visual payout was just as welcoming. It ends on an excellent note, visually and metaphorically. By the end, the inability for the Strangers to catch Murdock can be explained away in logistical terms; a city is bigger than a maze. While I'm reflecting back on faults, I just want to talk about the physics. It's just off the wall. The water moves to nonexistent weather; there's wind suck-age by space wall even though they're surround by a force field; the detective doesn't expand once in space; and finally the hull of the ship is held by bricks! This is all hindsight nitpicking of course, as none of this hindered the sensation I felt as some of the situation unfolds. The sun creeping over the city was beautiful; the detective floating out to space, a sad lost; the water pouring out of the city, majestic; and looking at space through a brick wall; a hauntingly disturbing visual. So for me, even when logic eventually catches up to you, it still doesn't take away from the awe-inspiring magic this movie can drop on you in the moment. It might hinder future viewings but then again, when you associate a feeling with a certain scene, that feeling will probably be there on repeated viewings.

Heck the trailer gives it away too. But I came into this movie with absolutely no idea what it was about. I was curious to watch the movie because it was referenced as Kafka Esquire. I'm just into the whole not seeing beyond the obvious type of movies. That and it was no.8 on IMDb's list of Kafka Esquire movies. The title definitely clued me in on what type of mood I would be in though. There were hardly any daytime sequences, except for that surrealistic last scene. Unlike most other movies, the dark nature of the movie actually is part of the plot itself and I found that; absolutely refreshing. Dark City is quite an experience in itself and even though it has its faults, mainly in its plot like most movie of its genre, it still doesn't take away from feelings it will create.The movie opens with fairly ominous overtones. The city looks bleak and you can feel something bad is going to happen. As it turns out, our moral senses are tingling. Our man, John Murdock, wakes up inside a chillingly lit bath tub full of water with blood on his face and a dead body on the floor. He gets phone call telling him to get out of there and quickly he does. His departure reveals a world that sleeps at once but carries on without notice. Our fugitive is being chased by overtly pale white men in trench coats. Their means are as menacing as their looks.At first they seem creepy but then soon they're revealed to be much more powerful. There in lies the first problem and that is that their threat is madly inconsistent. One minute they're shadowy men that lurks in the environment, and the next, they can not only fly but build the environment itself. Furthermore they can put the whole world to sleep at will as part of an experiment. How they can put drivers to sleep and not cause crashes is amusing though. Anyway, with this kind of power, what isn't within their reach? Well, apparently John. But that's because he has small powers himself; and even though he escapes with luck and timing, you get a sense that these omnipotent beings aren't quite as threatening as they first appeared. On that point, they aren't really a threat to mankind itself but rather just manipulative observers. And give credit to the film-makers for immersing us in that situation. We get glimpses into the confusion of what it's like to be a rat in an experiment. How cruel it is to see the people trying to explore why they can't remember past what is shown to us in the screen. It's quite depressing. At the same time, we can empathize with the Strangers for their curiosity to study us. Should a distant race happen upon Earth, it is reasonable to assume they would just pluck us up from our every day lives just to find out what makes us tick. What emotions do we have? What do we feel? What is our soul? Of course there isn't time to answer those questions as there's virtually no down time. In moments of character interplay, there is an underlying sense of dread in the air. When the characters aren't being introspective, the action itself is quite enjoyable. All the physical interaction is within the boundaries of the plot except when it comes to the climactic end battle. That's where it really shows its year of production.

As the nineties drew to a close, both groups decided that, in the absence of any serious alternative candidates, the Russians and their fellow-Slavs in Eastern Europe could continue to serve as the enemy. Hence, on the one hand, the Kosovo war and, on the other hand, films like The Peacemaker. (Russians also feature as the villains in other thrillers from this period, such as Crimson Tide and Air Force One).The Country and Western song The Devil's Right Hand contains the line called the peacemaker but I never knew why. The reference in the song, of course, is to the Colt 45 pistol, but the line could equally well apply to this violent action-adventure thriller which has little to do with making peace. The basic plot is that an evil Russian general has stolen a nuclear warhead and sold it to a Bosnian Serb terrorist, who intends to detonate it in Manhattan. The only people who can thwart this plot are the World's Number 1 Male Sex Symbol (as an American army officer) and his female counterpart (as an American intelligence agent).Apart from the inappropriate title, there were two things that surprised me about the film. The first is that a film in this very macho genre should have been directed by a woman, Mimi Leder. There is actually a discussion on this board about how different the film might have been if it had been directed by a man. (The whole discussion, in fact, seems to be based upon the questionable assumption that all action thrillers are directed by Kubrick-type auteurs who retain complete artistic control over any project they work on, but I will let that pass).The consensus view seems to be that a male director would have introduced a romance between George and Nicole and would have ended the film with a full-scale shootout. If Ms Leder was indeed responsible for the decision to omit any romantic sub-plot, I think that decision was the right one, as any such romance would have interfered with and slowed down the main action and made the film even longer than it is already. (At over two hours it probably exceeds the optimum length for a thriller of this type). There does not, however, seem to be any point in avoiding the standard cliché of the final shootout if you are going to replace it, as is done here, with the equally hoary cliché of the race against time to defuse a ticking bomb, which helpfully comes complete with a digital readout showing precisely how many minutes and seconds remain before Armageddon. That plot device was pretty corny even when it was used in the Bond vehicle Octopussy more than a decade earlier.The second thing that surprised me was that that arch-liberal George Clooney should have agreed to appear in what is essentially propaganda for the role of America's armed forces in keeping the world safe from the Great Russian Bear and its Slavic allies. The Russian general is portrayed as so evil that he is prepared to destroy part of his own country with a nuclear bomb in order to make a quick buck. By rights the Serb terrorist Gavric, prepared to destroy part of someone else's country in order to make a political point, should be portrayed as even more evil, given that he intends to destroy not a remote area of the Ural Mountains but a city of some eight million people. In fact, the film makes a misguided attempt to humanise Gavric, who makes a video explaining his actions in terms of revenge for the killing of his wife and child by a Muslim sniper, but never succeeds in making him sympathetic, or even particularly understandable, and certainly never makes any coherent point about the origins of the Bosnian War. I suspect that the intention was to make the film look like a serious statement about terrorism, so Clooney could make a shoot-'em-up thriller with a clear conscience and without his fans assuming that he had followed other action heroes like Chuck Norris, Rambo Stallone and Arnie the Terminator into the Republican Party.In any case, Clooney is not particularly good in this film, coming across as too laid-back and nonchalant. This style of acting has served him well in comedies such as One Fine Day and Intolerable Cruelty, but it can be a problem in thrillers such as this one and Ocean's Twelve. (To be fair to George, virtually the whole cast in Ocean's Twelve were so laid back they were practically horizontal). Nicole Kidman is rather better, but has less to do.Leder handles the various action sequences competently, but the film as a whole, with its predictable plot and outdated political attitudes, never arouses much interest. Crimson Tide works much better as a post-Cold War thriller because, by not showing the Russian villains and confining the action to an American submarine, it manages to find a new angle on its subject-matter.A final word about the music. Prokofiev (or, according to another version of the story, Stravinsky) once said of Rachmaninov that he had not written a hundred different works, merely the same work a hundred times. I am starting to get the same feeling about Hans Zimmer; once you have heard one of his film scores, you have heard them all. 5\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"17 September 2008","score":"1 out of 2 people found the following review useful","review":" The end of the Cold War may have been welcomed in most quarters, but there were at least two groups of people who regretted it, namely certain hawkish elements in Western political and military circles, who needed a new enemy to fight, and Hollywood film-makers, who needed a new subject for their political thrillers.

It is the first film I ever saw in theaters and it's also the first movie I purchased on video. I even own the same, worn-down, beat-up copy (and look upon it even more fondly than the widescreen edition, for sentimental reasons, of course). I think it's fair to say it's this movie that cemented my love of cinema, the high regard I hold for great escapism, which is sorely lacking from today's cinema; movies that should be fun now drag or bludgeon themselves with relentless awful scripts or MTV-style direction that turns relatively simple scenes into chaotic blurs. The Last Crusade may only be thirteen years old, but I think I can safely say they don't make them like they used to. The film stars, of course, Harrison Ford as Indy Jones, the archaeologist\/adventurer who's on yet another quest, this time to find his father, who'd been searching for the Holy Grail. Said Dad is played by none other than Sean Connery, whose highly charismatic performance is quick to place this film above the others in the trilogy. The rest of the film focuses on this ongoing journey between father and son (eventually joined along by Sallah and Marcus Brody), complete with amazing action and stunt sequences, clever humor, and nasty (but fun) surprises. The script, by Jeffrey Boam, takes a few cues from Raiders of the Lost Ark, but actually improves upon that story by adding more characterization, particularly with origin of Indy himself. And as a whole, the story is more engrossing because there are more fun clues offered toward the location of the Holy Grail and, thus, more engaging little discoveries (love the X marks the spot scene). I'm quite certain, like with Raiders, the plot has a few holes, but they're fairly hard to notice, and I've seen the movie quite a few times, but maybe it's just my enjoyment of the film clouding that up, which I suppose speaks volumes in favor of Spielberg's direction and the performances. Given that action and adventure is the series' selling point, you can expect the thrills and wondrous delight of discovery delivered in spades. The action scenes are terrific (and matched well with John Williams' rousing, memorable score), the best being an excellent ten-minute setpiece on board (and in) a Nazi tank in a sensational chase sequence across the desert.

It is the first film I ever saw in theaters and it's also the first movie I purchased on video. I even own the same, worn-down, beat-up copy (and look upon it even more fondly than the widescreen edition, for sentimental reasons, of course). I think it's fair to say it's this movie that cemented my love of cinema, the high regard I hold for great escapism, which is sorely lacking from today's cinema; movies that should be fun now drag or bludgeon themselves with relentless awful scripts or MTV-style direction that turns relatively simple scenes into chaotic blurs. The Last Crusade may only be thirteen years old, but I think I can safely say they don't make them like they used to. The film stars, of course, Harrison Ford as Indy Jones, the archaeologist\/adventurer who's on yet another quest, this time to find his father, who'd been searching for the Holy Grail. Said Dad is played by none other than Sean Connery, whose highly charismatic performance is quick to place this film above the others in the trilogy. The rest of the film focuses on this ongoing journey between father and son (eventually joined along by Sallah and Marcus Brody), complete with amazing action and stunt sequences, clever humor, and nasty (but fun) surprises. The script, by Jeffrey Boam, takes a few cues from Raiders of the Lost Ark, but actually improves upon that story by adding more characterization, particularly with origin of Indy himself. And as a whole, the story is more engrossing because there are more fun clues offered toward the location of the Holy Grail and, thus, more engaging little discoveries (love the X marks the spot scene). I'm quite certain, like with Raiders, the plot has a few holes, but they're fairly hard to notice, and I've seen the movie quite a few times, but maybe it's just my enjoyment of the film clouding that up, which I suppose speaks volumes in favor of Spielberg's direction and the performances. Given that action and adventure is the series' selling point, you can expect the thrills and wondrous delight of discovery delivered in spades. The action scenes are terrific (and matched well with John Williams' rousing, memorable score), the best being an excellent ten-minute setpiece on board (and in) a Nazi tank in a sensational chase sequence across the desert.

This is because as well plotted, acted, and directed as his films manifestly are, they appear to most critics as mere shiny baubles- all style and little substance. After all, Hitchcock took great pride in mass appeal; even going so far as being one of the few film directors to 'stoop' to active involvement in the 'lesser medium' of television. He also joyed in being termed the filmic 'master of suspense', implying that his films were geared toward the revelation of a plot point- usually the capture of a criminal, or not, and not some deeper existential queries.In the main, when one thinks of the top film names in the Hitchcock canon, this is true Suspicion, Rear Window, North By Northwest, or Psycho. Yet, even in that list of immortal films, there are cracks in the theory. After all, Psycho's greatness is not merely dependent upon the revelation of Mother as Norman Bates, but the tale of the Janet Leigh character, her death and aftermath, how it effects ancillary characters, and what would become of Norman Bates; and let's pretend the sequels never happened. And what of The Birds? Pure chaos. Is the world doomed? We do not know. The film wisely ends on an ellipsis. The fact is that while Hitchcock's name and reputation were made on mass appeal and a Lowest Common Denominator style- albeit in the highest vein, there was a part of the technical master that wanted to be a true auteur, someone who would alternate between art films and pop cultural iconography. Unfortunately, the demands for financial success made the appearance of the 'artsy Hitch' all the more rare as his career went on.There were comedies like Mr. And Mrs. Smith, and Neo-Realist wannabe fare like The Wrong Man, which had measures of artistic success, but perhaps the best example of Hitchcock in full auteur mode comes from his first color film, 1948's Rope. It is a film based on the infamous 1920s Leopold and Loeb case, where two dilettante homosexual lovers in Chicago decided their superiority to the world entitled them to kill just for the fun of it. They murdered a fourteen year old boy, were caught, and sent to jail. While such overt things as homosexuality were verboten in mid-Twentieth Century Hollywood, due to production codes, it is there in full, on the screen in this film, and what amazes is how much more realistic the portrayal of homosexuals (albeit killers) and their relationship's power plays are in this nearly six decade old film than in the recent atrocious Brokeback Mountain, which indulged all the worst clichés of homosexuality. Yet, by not mentioning 'it' overtly, its ellipsis creates suspense, and forces the viewer to interpolate things into the gaps.Reputedly, the film's two lead actors, and its screenwriter, were gay, which only adds to the depth of watching and rewatching this film. Not only that, but Hitchcock makes a brilliant move early on in the film, right after the opening cameo of himself on the street (the other cameo is about 55 minutes into the film, as a red neon sign of Hitchcock's profile flashes in the background as the guests leave the party), and the credits. He shows us the two main characters strangling their friend David Kentley (Dick Hogan) to death. Thus, we know the film will not be a tired whodunit? And, as the film progresses, we know it will not even be a will they get caught? film, for the writing is so great, and the dialogue so precise, that it reads like a play of the sort that an Oscar Wilde may have penned had he done straight dramas. While film is a visual medium, it is one almost wholly dependent, in the sound era, upon words. Only Hitchcock's earlier Lifeboat was almost as dependent upon dialogue, although that film was not as needful of sharp repartee- Tallulah Bankhead aside. Of course, there are Wildean puns and ironies galore, such as the dead man's aunt looking at Phillip's hands, which just strangled her nephew, and saying, 'these hands will bring you great fame.' She means as a pianist, not strangler, but the viewer gets the joke. There are also other nods to murder, such as 'knock 'em dead,' 'I could strangle you,' and 'killing two birds with one stone,' which rise above cliché since we know that there is real foul play beneath their utterance&#133;. Oddly lost in all the speculation about homosexuality in the film is the overt critique of Nazism and racism that the film presents, which is almost never commented upon by critics, even as Brandon condemns Hitler and the Nazis as moronic brutes. This aversion to the Lowest Common Denominator, by characters, runs through a number of Hitchcock films, but never is it more well expressed than when Brandon turns to Phillip, just after the murder, and says, 'Good and evil, right and wrong, were invented for the ordinary average man, the inferior man, because he needs them.' Then, of the dead David, he says, jokingly, 'Of course, he was a Harvard graduate. That might be grounds for justifiable homicide.'All in all, Rope is Hitchcock at his very best, without MacGuffins but with depth, clarity and, most of all, a vision, although, oddly a vision that is not primarily visual, even as Hitchcock knows exactly where and what should on screen at any given moment, for it is the screenplay which does all the heavy lifting of this film, and the weight it lifts is still nonpareil.

One more thing, you have an all out prize fight, you wait until the fight is over, one guy is left standing. And that's how you know who won. Kevin Costner stars as Ness, a federal agent who has come to Chicago during the Prohibition Era, when corruption in the local police department is rampant. His mission is to put crime lord Capone (Robert De Niro) out of business, but Capone is so powerful and popular that Ness is not taken seriously by the law or the press. One night, discouraged, he meets a veteran patrolman, Jimmy Malone (Sean Connery), and discovers that the acerbic Irishman is the one honest man he's been seeking. Malone has soon helped Ness recruit a gunslinger rookie, George Stone (Andy Garcia), and, joined by nebbish accountant Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith), the men doggedly pursue Capone and his illegal interests. At first a laughingstock, Ness soon has Capone outraged over his and Malone's sometimes law-bending tactics, and the vain mobster strikes back in vicious style. Ultimately, it is the most unexpected and minor of crimes, tax evasion, which proves Capone's undoing.A pretty amazing film by Scarface director Brian De Palma. One of De Palma's best although I still consider his epic film Scarface as his best film ever but still, this film delivers all the goods when it comes to the gangster genre. I can't really say that it was excellent because the script to me seems lacking and sometimes it suffers from plot holes and a cheesy, over the top death scene. It was a good death (I won't mention who dies for the sake of spoilers) but it was cheesy. Good, in a cheesy kind of way.Although, I think what made this film work was the superb acting by Class A Hollywood stars. You got Robert De Niro as Al Capone (the baseball scene is an instant favorite of mine), the guy never made a bad film according to my book. And in every film that he stars in, he gets better and better and better. De Niro is a method actor and The Untouchables just showed us how committed he really is to the job.On the other side of the law, you got Kevin Costner, Sean Connery and Andy Garcia, who all gave pretty impressive performances.

I can't really say that it was excellent because the script to me seems lacking and sometimes it suffers from plot holes and a cheesy, over the top death scene. It was a good death (I won't mention who dies for the sake of spoilers) but it was cheesy. Good, in a cheesy kind of way.Although, I think what made this film work was the superb acting by Class A Hollywood stars. You got Robert De Niro as Al Capone (the baseball scene is an instant favorite of mine), the guy never made a bad film according to my book. And in every film that he stars in, he gets better and better and better. De Niro is a method actor and The Untouchables just showed us how committed he really is to the job.On the other side of the law, you got Kevin Costner, Sean Connery and Andy Garcia, who all gave pretty impressive performances.

Somebody messes with me, I'm gonna mess with with him. Somebody steals from me, I'm gonna say you stole. Not talk to him for spitting on the sidewalk. Understand? Now, I have done nothing to harm these people but they are angered with me, so what do they do, doctor up some income tax, for which they have no case. To speak to me like me, no, to harass a peaceful man. I pray to god if I ever had a grievance I'd have a little more self respect. One more thing, you have an all out prize fight, you wait until the fight is over, one guy is left standing. And that's how you know who won. Kevin Costner stars as Ness, a federal agent who has come to Chicago during the Prohibition Era, when corruption in the local police department is rampant. His mission is to put crime lord Capone (Robert De Niro) out of business, but Capone is so powerful and popular that Ness is not taken seriously by the law or the press. One night, discouraged, he meets a veteran patrolman, Jimmy Malone (Sean Connery), and discovers that the acerbic Irishman is the one honest man he's been seeking. Malone has soon helped Ness recruit a gunslinger rookie, George Stone (Andy Garcia), and, joined by nebbish accountant Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith), the men doggedly pursue Capone and his illegal interests. At first a laughingstock, Ness soon has Capone outraged over his and Malone's sometimes law-bending tactics, and the vain mobster strikes back in vicious style. Ultimately, it is the most unexpected and minor of crimes, tax evasion, which proves Capone's undoing.A pretty amazing film by Scarface director Brian De Palma.

You used to be able to literally love a film to death back when the medium was analog...repeat viewings were killer. But I digress..Repo man has a specific peculiarity that seems to permeate every aspect of the film. Everything about it seems just slightly off and as the film progresses it slips further and further into lunacy...in the best way possible. Over all the piece feels rather anti establishment but it does so with out seeming overly didactic. Instead it seems to poke fun at the establishment and the misfits that cant or wont fit into it. This is a comedy of the highest order...one that is funny with out trying to be. The visual approach is rather plain...I mean this is the best way possible as the film is so odd it would probably be distracting to have a wacky visual style.

To be fair, I didn't make it too far through this one, so maybe something funny happens eventually. First you see Fraser playing an unlikeable loser, which is more sad than funny. The devil turns up, acts outrageous but not funny, so I figure, maybe it gets better when we get into the wishes. So I fast forward to the first wish, and there's a long thing about Fraser discovering he can speak Spanish which isn't remotely funny. So I fast forward through that to an inept version of a gag from the first movie. Then there's Fraser as another annoying unfunny character. Then I gave up.So maybe the rest of it is brilliantly funny. But I doubt it.First off, while Fraser is a very charming light comedic actor, I don't think he's any good at this Saturday Night Live-style character sketch comedy. He's not funny, he's just annoying.Even if I hadn't seen the original film I would consider this abhorrent, but it's also striking how this film changes things in ways that are inevitably worse. In the original, the Fraser character, played by Dudley Moore, was shy and awkward and miserable, but he wasn't someone you felt you wouldn't want to be trapped in a room with. Fraser plays the role as an insufferable bore with no redeeming qualities.As for Hurley's version of the Devil, well, it's the sexy bad girl thing, a concept of Satan a guy would get after striking out with a hot girl in a bar. The original movie's devil, Peter Cook, was a very distinct and well thought-out character, a friendly bloke fond of cruel practical jokes who acted like the best friend Moore so needed. And Cook's performance was sharp and brilliant. Hurley doesn't seem to have thought anything about what the Devil would be like, she's just concerned with seeming sexy and a little bad. It is weak on its own; compared to Cook's performance, it is pathetic beyond description.But I want to emphasize again that I am not saying this is a terrible movie compared to the original. This is a terrible movie compared to other comedies of this and every other era.

It deserved every Oscar nomination it received in 1992.The plot is fairly simple. After a introductory sequence, the movie boils down to preparing to interview witnesses and then interviewing them (although there are a few twists along the way). But what makes this story great is its rejection of the typical whodunit clichés. Instead of focusing on fingerprint analysis and gloves that don't fit, this movie choses to show its evidence-strapped lawyers try to prove their clients innocence through logic and reason.How this film wasn't nominated for a best screenplay Oscar, I have no idea. The dialog is perfectly paced, brisk when addressing tedious plot points, wordy during the quiet dramatic scenes. The acting fares just as well as the writing. Tom Cruise is excellent in the main role. He really makes the viewer feel the hopelessness of the case. Demi Moore is decent as the female lead and the underrated Kevin Bacon is outstanding as the D.A, as always. But Jack Nicholson is the real star of the movie. He is only in four scenes but his presence dominates the whole film. His best scene is his closing monolohue, which has to be one of the best moments in Hollywood history.A Few good men is a little light on the suspense, until the end that is. The climactic scene, even though it contains no violence, gets your heart pounding like any good action scene.There is little more to be said.
