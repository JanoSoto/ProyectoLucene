As a rule, I want to see explosions and terrible slaughter.  I loath sentimental slop.  So, when I sat down to watch Iron Giant, I was not expecting much more than a Disney-esque piece of emotional goo.  I'd also read the original book, and I was prepared to be annoyed by departures from the 'Iron Man'.Yet within minutes, I was totally hooked on this fabulous piece of animation.  The quality of the picture - the visual effect of the animation - is truly stunning. The film is a work of art.  None of the sloppy crap that Disney passes off for animation these days.  The world of 1950s New England is beautifully recreated.  The attention to detail is impressive. As a military buff, I was particularly impressed by the authentic representation of Patton tanks and Sabre fighters.  The landscapes are awe inspiring, and the musical score sets off the visual spectacle magnificently.  The whole picture has an overpowering aura of quality, effort and skill.  You are properly immersed in the film's world.  Such fine workmanship is impressive, and stands in sharp contrast to the poorly drawn pulp that floods kids TV these days - the abomination that is pokemon springs to mind as the very antithesis of this movie.Enough of appearances.  A good visual picture is never going to make up for a bad story.  And I really thought that the storyline was going to be awful. The film is radically different to the story told by Ted Hughes. Normally, I can't stand it when movies dare to depart from the novels on which they claim to be based.  But in this case, I am prepared to make an exception. The movie explores many more interesting ideas than the book.  Hughes was more concerned with a dull environmentalist idea, suggesting that the Iron Man was somehow mother nature's response to the pollution caused by humanity.  The film, however, takes a totally different view of the Iron 'Giant'.  The Cold War context of McCarthyism, 'Red Scares' and the emergent Space Race is intriguingly utilised to engage the far more interesting issues of superpower rivalry, military paranoia and the crass naiveté of a culture that seriously believes 'duck and cover' will see school kids safely through nuclear holocaust.Some people have expressed the opinion that the film takes a politically correct view of guns.  Yet when we realise that the Iron Giant is himself a colossal weapons system, it is clear that the film is more sophisticated than any simplistic anti-gun rant.  Indeed, all of the 'good' characters in the film are connected with guns.  Hogarth has toy guns, the Iron Giant is a gun himself, the honourable military men are armed.  The paranoid and slippery CIA agent is in fact conspicuously unarmed.  Even in the scene with the deer hunters, the men themselves are not cast in a negative light at all.  I would be the first to choke with rage if I thought that this movie was trying to convey a sanctimonious and politically correct message of anti-gun propaganda.  Instead, I think that the picture considers the relationship between man and his weapons. We see that it is the decisions taken by individuals that decide whether good or evil is done, not whether they happen to be in direct possession of a gun.  The Iron Giant is, after all, capable of destroying all of mankind with his arsenal of weaponry, yet his decision to refrain from using it makes him a great force for good. Kent Mansley, on the other hand, has no gun in his hand, yet is solely responsible for the decision to unleash nuclear weaponry upon his own countrymen in his personal quest to destroy a non-American robot.This is a greatly enjoyable and rather moving film, and, in spite of myself, I must recommend it wholeheartedly to everyone.  Even the most rational and level-headed of movie-goers can find something to like in this picture. Go watch!

I guess that is why some of this movie's greatest scenes are played in silence. `I was ten years old the summer I killed my father.' Tells Eve in a narrative introduction, making it hard to tell if we are being told a story in flashback or viewing a period of exaggeration. This was a delicious introduction, making me wonder if I would be exploring a forgotten chronicle or subsiding in metaphor.  Would this be an abbreviation of something or indirect deliberation of something else? On some levels I am still in awe over such a question. We witness the lifestyle of a young girl named Eve, the threads of who's name is derived from suffering in its cruellest form, slavery.  Eve lives with a family built on one older sister, one younger brother, a mother, a grandmother, a father who is a doctor, a cheat, an all around low-life and a cursed aunt who can see the future. One night after witnessing her daddy with another women Eve is stricken with awe, her emotions are sent into spirals, the family doesn't know, but is thrown into a vortex of uninspired feelings and everything resides in Eve, yet all that comes out is hate. Hates fuels this film, maybe more accurate is resentment. The characters tell their stories, each of which protest a different view, without speaking, only to evade righteous use or words. There is a fable to behold here but no means by which to generate a decent forward movement so it strays, it ponders, it entices and it enthrals through sounds, imagery and feeling of mass awareness. But this never removes the fact that these people resent each other, or maybe themselves, I don't know. I don't need to. Director Kasi Lemmons creates  something astonishing here. There is a universe within a timeframe that can be haunting without being affirmative. She places her camera in front of characters, only to have them look off to the side as they speak as if to mean something that we can't see. A lot of films are self conscience, they are sure of themselves, have belief in their structure and lead us where they want us to go. This film goes where we want it to lead. Lemmons takes us down one path, not to educate us, but to make ethical decision about another. This film struck me with style not dignity, most would have gloated and went for emotion bondage. I loved how it made me see what I shouldn't only to congratulate me with what I actually couldn't illustrate on my own. There was a sensation to this, a stigmatic receptor of insubordinate journeys into fear and loneliness with the passion of a war torn beast, this is material that will by no means evoke happiness in you, yet bring forward spear-headed emotions. This is not a film that runs in forward fashion, it may not even have a story to produce it's movements. This film is like a painting, it is meant to be emotional, an array of colours that grab the mind and persuade it be, not ask it to follow. Yet although artistic, this is not David Lynch, it is not strange, it has characters who not only understand reality but live in it. You don't expect Eve's Bayou to lead you beyond the realm is sanity because this is nothing you expect it to be and everything you believe it won't come to. Due to this, scenes collide in un-primitive fashion. There are no beginning or ends, cuts represent nothing but an editor doing his job, this is a train wreck of melodramatic soap opera in this form of distillation, one of the best films of 1997. And it works on the grounds of discovery. I love films that push from one thing to he next in hopes of finding something unrecognizable, this film does one better. It places these happenings in a realm of constituency, leaving the viewer never to know what to make of such offerings. All the actors play their parts for what they are worth, they all have the same basic role to play, but on different emotional arks. Samuel L. Jackson is particularly good as Eve's father, a man who struts around oblivious to himself. The script, also and original work by Lemmons, presents another fiendishly clever device in which to motivate the audience. She portrays all characters as constituting neither good nor evil. The only villain in this story is the story itself. Empathy is the only hero on display in these surroundings. This is a piece of work that is artistic, poetic and reprehensible, sometimes all at the same time, sometimes all of its on game. It is a film that twists around bends and hides between crevices only to watch itself unfold. I had no idea how such a complex story could end, but waited in silent amazement to find out, and so will you. Not because it is unforeseeable but because it doesn't come to conclusions, it simply can't.

First off, it had Robin Williams in it. I hadn't seen Robin Williams do anything worth seeing for quite some time, and for some reason the film spoke to me, like the voice in Field of Dreams. Second, it had Ed Norton in it, who is one of the most careful actors in Hollywood today. He only chooses movies that he knows are worth his involvement, and I must say thank goodness he believed in this. And finally, it was directed by Danny DeVito, who has always had my respect as a hilarious guy and a fine filmmaker. When I heard he was directing this film and that it was, in fact, a comedy that was rated R, I immediately called my buddy Jason (who was thinking the exact same thing by this point) and in March of 2002, we headed for the cinemas. Every aspect of Death to Smoochy sets it apart from any film I've seen in the past four years. Not only did it have a stunning cast and a truly original story, but it was also unbelievably funny. This was a film that both my friend and I felt was made specifically for us. It had a style of humor that is usually lacking in all comedies of present. And the actors performing those lines couldn't have done a better job. We were two out of probably five people in the theatre, including the father of the year that brought his two five year old children to see it. Apparently the large R rating that was branded across the screen didn't convince him that there was any reason to doubt this movie would be appropriate for his toddlers. I think after the first expletive was uttered, a whopping three or four minutes into the feature, dad should have probably known where this was going. But no, he and his children remained through every single hilarious minute. From the dill-dough cookie to the Jersey Nazi rally, Death to Smoochy was a roller coaster ride of unbelievably hilarious proportions, even if it was definitely not appropriate for children. But hey, that's why we have a rating system. The cinematography was surprisingly well thought out and classy, done in such a way that made Death to Smoochy rise from being just another Hollywood comedy to an original venture that no one can lay claim to. I own the DVD and bought it the day it came out, and every time I watch it I see or hear something new. The color schemes they used in the film were completely believable and yet surprisingly meaningful. You see the brightness of the characters' wardrobe and immediately are reminded of cartoons or other children's' programming. Nora and Sheldon wear complimentary colors every time they are around each other, and creates an almost subconscious acceptance of their relationship. Everything looks soft and almost innocent, when the harsh dialogue and rough situations stand as a direct contrast. The film is an amazingly woven quilt of comedy, tenderness, edge, intrigue, and silliness. I commend Danny DeVito (unlike nearly every other critic out there) for his decision to take on this edgy, original, ambitious script and breathe such life into it that it literally leapt off the pages and did the jiggy ziggy dance.

The cinematography was surprisingly well thought out and classy, done in such a way that made Death to Smoochy rise from being just another Hollywood comedy to an original venture that no one can lay claim to. I own the DVD and bought it the day it came out, and every time I watch it I see or hear something new. The color schemes they used in the film were completely believable and yet surprisingly meaningful. You see the brightness of the characters' wardrobe and immediately are reminded of cartoons or other children's' programming. Nora and Sheldon wear complimentary colors every time they are around each other, and creates an almost subconscious acceptance of their relationship. Everything looks soft and almost innocent, when the harsh dialogue and rough situations stand as a direct contrast. The film is an amazingly woven quilt of comedy, tenderness, edge, intrigue, and silliness. I commend Danny DeVito (unlike nearly every other critic out there) for his decision to take on this edgy, original, ambitious script and breathe such life into it that it literally leapt off the pages and did the jiggy ziggy dance.

It is one of the few movies around that makes you think, and was made not with the intent of giving the audience any answers, but in asking them questions.I would agree that reading Arthur C. Clarke's book version (which isn't just a novelization of the movie but was written parallel to the movie; for instance, in the movie the astronauts go to Jupiter but in the book they go to Saturn) is very useful in understanding what happens in this movie. SPOILERS-------The premise is very simple.  Alien beings have decided to assist in and then monitor human evolution.  The ape men at the beginning of the movie are vegaterians, going hungry not realizing that they can eat the animals what wander around their camp.  They cannot defend themselves against predators or even against a rival clan that drives them away from their watering hole.  The Obelisk appears and the Obelisk teaches the ape men how to start using tools.  Armed with this knowledge, the ape men now become carnivores and start eating the abundant animals and then use their superior weaponry to drive off the rival clan and reclaim the pool of water----and note that one of the astronauts in the latter part of the movie is Frank Poole.The movie then cuts to the future and scientists have found another Obelisk deliberately buried on the Moon by the aliens.  When sunlight hits the Obelisk, it sends out a signal towards Jupiter.  The signal is a beacon to the aliens who now know that humanity has progressed enough to go to the Moon and dig up the Obelisk.  En route to the Moon the astronauts have to deal with their supercomputer, HAL 9000.  HAL is supposedly incapable of error and yet makes a mistake which will jeopardize the mission.  Unable to trust HAL to run the ship anymore, the astronauts have to turn off his higher functions.  HAL discovers the plot though and murders all but one of the astronauts.

I thought that the acting left something to be desired; none of the actors were well-known to American audiences and none of them went on to have notable careers--but I don't think the movie would've been all that much better had some superstar of the day, say Charlton Heston, played the astronaut's role.

It will divide viewers, but I argue that this is the hallmark of all true art. You will either love it or hate it, you will either get it or you won't. But it won't leave you indifferent.Julianne Moore plays Carol White, the film's childlike protagonist with a phenomenal skill. In the hands of a more showy, ostentatious actress, Carol's 'illness' could have appeared trivial, her character, flighty, whiny and irritating. In the hands of Julianne Moore who is, in my opinion, the most intelligent, thoughtful and captivating actress working today, Carol's predicament is moving amd her character endearing. Her performance truly is astonishing. Never does she feel the need to overact, to emphasise Carol's confusion or her fear. She plays her with a childlike acceptance, a surface simplicity and a sing-songy girlish voice, and she is a master of restraint, implication, understatement. I have yet to see a more impressive performance from an actress whose skill lies in making it appear like she is doing very little, when really there is a huge amount going on underneath the surface. The film would be worth it for Julianne Moore alone, but it also has other things to reccommend it.There's the excellent direction from the genius, Todd Haynes. His mainstream hit, the wonderful homage to Sirk 'Far From Heaven' catapulted Haynes into the mainstream, but I find this work even more affecting. Haynes is a genius at utilising the mise-en-scene for the maximum effect. He uses his camera as a painter would with colour - each shot is masterfully composed, with the director never allowing us to get too close to Julianne Moore's character, making her predicament all the more confusing and alienating. This is a film which demands thought and concentration, and what you take from it will depend upon individual disposition and experience.The dialogue is generally sparse and quite functional, meaning that emphasis is placed onto the menacing soundtrack (giving the film a horror\/thriller feel), the meticulously orchestrated mise-en-scene and, of course, the amazing nuances and depth of Julianne Moore's artistic gifts. In terms of what the film is trying to say, there is a real sense of satire in the second section of the film (When Carol goes to the commune to be 'cured') but there is no insistence upon one single message. This is reflected with a deeply ambiguous ending which leaves one feeling anxious and confused.Overall, 'Safe' is a masterful piece of work. The team of Julianne Moore and Todd Haynes is (as we have seen with 'Far From Heaven') a match made ... in heaven. I would urge those who appreciate non maintream, thought provoking and unconventional films to give it try, just don't go in with 'Hollywood' expectations as you will be disappointed. Finally, I'd like to end by reiterating what is possibly the film's main strength - the presence of Julianne Moore.

This is reflected with a deeply ambiguous ending which leaves one feeling anxious and confused.Overall, 'Safe' is a masterful piece of work. The team of Julianne Moore and Todd Haynes is (as we have seen with 'Far From Heaven') a match made ... in heaven. I would urge those who appreciate non maintream, thought provoking and unconventional films to give it try, just don't go in with 'Hollywood' expectations as you will be disappointed. Finally, I'd like to end by reiterating what is possibly the film's main strength - the presence of Julianne Moore. This truly is a captivating performance from her, and certainly one of the most astonishing I am likely ever to see. 'Safe' gives us the chance to watch this gifted actress in one of her most underrated, little seen, yet most remarkable roles.

Queen of the Damned is my least favorite of them all, however it is still a very good book, though slow in a few sections in my opinion, and that Queen is damned better than this damn Queen.Others have explained how this movie doesn't bother to follow the books so I won't dwell on that, but I wholeheartedly agree.  What the hell were they smoking when they wrote the script to this?  Or perhaps, since some drugs do make people more creative, (throw your music collection away if you don't think so) what WEREN'T they smoking?The only storyline gripe I'll go over here is all the vampires fighting Akasha at the end of the movie.  Those other vampires are MAJOR characters in the book.  They're given a glimpse of screen time in the movie.. all of a sudden the vampire posse you've seen 3 frames of previously shows up and wipes out the main villain who wasn't even in the movie much. (yes, I know she died, doesn't make the movie any better)  They really needed to at least introduce some of the other vampires before they came in to play the hero role.My biggest gripe with this movie is the soundtrack, and more specifically the garbage Lestat sings.  Why does Lestat suddenly turn into the guy from Korn when he sings?  Does that make ANY sense??  ANY?!?!  Besides, Korn is awful, and regardless of their talent, I don't exactly think of that when I think of something a vampire would sing.  I think maybe something similar to Type O Negative music, with NEW vocals, not just an existing band's song, may have fit a little better without sounding like glam rock, which is kind of what the book makes it sound like, and I think even that would work beautifully in comparison with the crap that comes out of Lestat's throat... oh sorry, I mean out of nowhere since it doesn't sound like Lestat or even close to it.This is pure tripe that was thrown together to take advantage of Vampire Chronicles movie rights, was made for a quick buck.  As a fan of the books I was insulted by the plot, and I don't think there would even be enough there for this thing to even make sense to people that haven't read the books.Avoid it.  Interview With the Vampire didn't follow the book 100% either, but it was beautifully filmed and retained the feel of the book.  This is crap.

They are quiet visually, they are quiet audibly, and they are quiet in their approach.  What this leaves you with is the story.  The focus shifts from special effects, sweeping orchestral movements, breath taking cinematography, and leaves the audience to focus on what any film's main objective is, or at least should be - storytelling.L.I.E. is one such film.  It quietly presents its characters and gives you an insiders view into their world.  But that's all it is -  a view.  And there lies in the bravery of this film.  It gives you the information but prepares no case, no moral argument, and no judgement.  It just points out what is.When taking a breath and pulling back into the objective, rather than remaining subjectively argumentative, we discover that there are no good characters in this film.  They all have behaviours or commit actions which can be found by some to be morally reprehensible.  There is the best friend who is a conscious-free thief, a liar, and a hustler.  There is the school mate who commits incest with his younger sister on a regular basis.  There is the father who has quickly substituted lust for love, beats up on his child, and is potentially a white-collar crook.  Even the main character Howie, the hub of this story's wheel, is a part time crook and uses his naivety to his own advantage.And of course, Big John.  The easy target as the antagonist.  He is an ex-marine who has an incurable attraction to young teenage boys, and who will act out his fantasies with them.If all the characters have their weaknesses which can be used on the attack, who then becomes the protagonist?Each character has their flaws, great and small. But each character also has their strengths, both great and small - even Big John - which are worth noting.  But nowhere in this film (except the second to last shot), does the filmmaker lay down his own judgement on the events.  It would sell the film short.  It would leave it hollow like so many of its big budget counterparts.  The judgement is left to the audience.  If it provokes, in what ever way, that provocation is the sign of its own accomplishment.Don't be fooled by the complexity of this film by remaining on the exterior.

But that is common place and certainly doesn't do this justice.  Allow yourself to be pulled in and there you will find the complexity of the characters and the situations they find themselves in. Far more interesting than newspaper headline, trite and tedious characterisations.Roger Ebert of the Suntimes said in his review The ending is a cheap shot. The movie and the ending have so little in common that it's as if the last scene is spliced in from a different film.  In hindsight, I can't help but agree.  It was the big film corporate  response to the independent story telling artist  we have a problem that needs resolving, thus remove the problem (rather than solve it), and thus the film can conclude.

It just points out what is.When taking a breath and pulling back into the objective, rather than remaining subjectively argumentative, we discover that there are no good characters in this film.  They all have behaviours or commit actions which can be found by some to be morally reprehensible.  There is the best friend who is a conscious-free thief, a liar, and a hustler.  There is the school mate who commits incest with his younger sister on a regular basis.  There is the father who has quickly substituted lust for love, beats up on his child, and is potentially a white-collar crook.  Even the main character Howie, the hub of this story's wheel, is a part time crook and uses his naivety to his own advantage.And of course, Big John.  The easy target as the antagonist.  He is an ex-marine who has an incurable attraction to young teenage boys, and who will act out his fantasies with them.If all the characters have their weaknesses which can be used on the attack, who then becomes the protagonist?Each character has their flaws, great and small. But each character also has their strengths, both great and small - even Big John - which are worth noting.  But nowhere in this film (except the second to last shot), does the filmmaker lay down his own judgement on the events.  It would sell the film short.  It would leave it hollow like so many of its big budget counterparts.  The judgement is left to the audience.  If it provokes, in what ever way, that provocation is the sign of its own accomplishment.Don't be fooled by the complexity of this film by remaining on the exterior. On the exterior, this film is simply about paedophilia, teenage coming of age, teenage angst, homosexuality, sexuality in general, peer pressure, etcetera and forever so-on.   But that is common place and certainly doesn't do this justice.  Allow yourself to be pulled in and there you will find the complexity of the characters and the situations they find themselves in. Far more interesting than newspaper headline, trite and tedious characterisations.Roger Ebert of the Suntimes said in his review The ending is a cheap shot. The movie and the ending have so little in common that it's as if the last scene is spliced in from a different film.  In hindsight, I can't help but agree.  It was the big film corporate  response to the independent story telling artist  we have a problem that needs resolving, thus remove the problem (rather than solve it), and thus the film can conclude.  With a film that is as well thought out as this one, a conclusion isn't necessary and isn't wanted.  Trust the audience to draw their own conclusions - they'll prove right most of the time.

Lynch takes wholesome Americana visions of mom and apple pie and focuses in close-up to show us that sometimes the apples in that pie are rotten.More importantly, this is a film that transcends style to become a hellishly realistic vision of Americans, and how we view and interact with the world around us.

Jeffrey Beaumont does what others wont  he steps clear of the tree-lined streets full of single-family homes built for nice people like him to explore the the monolithic apartment building on the corner, which contains stories both beautiful and grotesque.  Literally and figuratively, he becomes part of one of those stories, as Lynch transforms Jeffrey as the voyeur to the camera as voyeur.The specifics of Jeffrey's adventure are irrelevant, and the plot seems an overblown version of the film noir mom is watching on TV.

Jeffrey's epiphany rivals that of Neo in The Matrix  while Neo can finally understand the feelings he's had all of his life because reality wasn't real, Jeffrey's reality and his happy-go-lucky demeanor are called into question violently.  He is forever changed not just by what he's seen, but by the new perceptions he has of reality, and the fact that what he has seen defies any explanation that would have been offered in his ordinary world.The ending of the film is a constant source of debate for viewers.  Does it represent the removal of those rotten apples, or just the bliss of choosing to ignore them and dig in?  It's in the eye of the beholder, but either view can represent the same thing, depending on how badly the viewer wants to see this film world returned to its normal state.Acting is dead-on for what Lynch wants to achieve.  The story is solid, and the direction is beyond reproach.  Some filming styles were considered experimental at the time, but are much more mainstream today (Fincher, etc.).  Nevertheless, they are used to great effect and their impact is not lost with time.This film ranks with Hitchcock's Vertigo as an all-time classic example of American storytelling on film.

I did not expect much in terms of good crafting when I first saw this film, and I was pleasantly surprised. The acting is truly enjoyable. Sly does well as the normally strong silent type who slips out some emotion. Rachael Leigh Cook does a great job with her character. Alan Cumming as usual is fun to watch. This could almost be billed as a comeback for Mickey Rourke. Michael Caine's role was lacking I felt - too bad his character was not built up more to substantiate his casting, other than the fact he was in the original. John C, McGinley just about stole the film.  He's a riot to watch in a role like this one. It would have been nice to see Rhona Mitra as Audrey instead of Geraldine. There were some deleted scenes that would have added a bit more depth to the film, and I would have really enjoyed more Les Fletcher, even if it was only on the phone - amusing Tom Sizemore voice-overs. I normally dislike the kind of music used in the movie but the work by Tyler Bates and Jellybean Benitez won me over and I got the soundtrack and the score and still did not get everything used in the movie.So these are all good elements, shot well with creative cinematography and clever editing (nice use of flash-frames). But why did the movie not do well?  It's pretty obvious - the plot holes are worse than Brumby's back at the end of the movie. But for me scenes with Sly and McGinley like the ones in the beginning of the film and the hotel elevator are great. Rachael Leigh Cook shows her ability by making you want to forget her at the beginning of the film and by the end you can feel for her character. Sly does what he does best and is menacing but looking good all the while, and shows some emotional range that was hard to pull off with the character he was playing but he does it nicely.  There are more as well, and the sum of the good scenes is a greater total than the issues.So if you can get over the shortcomings, and you like action flicks, I think you will really enjoy this movie. I know I did. ","genre":"Action, Crime, Drama"},{"date":"24 June 2003","score":"0 out of 1 people found the following review useful","review":"  It's been a while since I last saw this movie. With T3 coming out soon, which thus far I've no desire to see, it's had me remembering the first two installments of this series. Both are well done, but there are a lot of reasons I prefer this original movie.1. The freshness of it. Arnold Schwarzenegger was relatively unknown (except for Conan the Barbarian fans)as an actor. James Cameron was unknown as a director. Linda Hamilton, Michael Biehn were all unknowns. It is a straightforward story with incredible tension.2. Arnold makes a better bad guy than good guy.  This is my biggest reason for preferring the original. Arnold doesn't say much more than a dozen words. Being unknown, he's viewed less as Schwarzenegger playing yet another action role, and more as the character himself - a superstrong, persistent, unstoppable terminator with no conscience.3. The dark tone of the film.  T2 is a load of fun, but it's a blatantly intended summer film. It's choreographed with scenes that just pack it in for the box office. Terminator is anything but this, being sinister and foreboding. It's my impression that this was a nice personal project from Cameron that started this franchise when it had as much success as it did, but even more so when Arnold's box-office status really took off.----------Spoiler Alert!------------I have two main drawbacks with this film. The special effects with the bare terminator were probably cutting-edge at the time.  But it looks so much like a cartoon super-imposed in the wide-angle shots.Then there is the paradox of John Connor's conception. It's not enough to diminish the entertainment value of this movie, but this one absurdity stands out since everything else (given a 1984 viewpoint of world history and politics) seems at least possible.  It does make for an entertaining twist to discover Kyle Reese as the father.  But it can't help but rack your brain to think... how can John Connor send Kyle back on this assignment, if he has not yet gone to conceive him?  But I know by now this is a tired argument.  Like I said, it's still highly entertaining, but sticks out as the biggest absurdity---------END SPOILER ALERT-------One last interesting note is the inclusion of Franco Columbu as the future terminator, who in real life was one of Arnold's best friends and bodybuilding competitors.

Hanks grants this movie with a heart and soul. His stage delivery is good but unfortunately hampered by really weak, unfunny material.  In his acting, the sincerity, drive and passion for the job are strongly conveyed, as well as a fairly believable nature to his eventual love for Field's character.  This performance, in my opinion, outshines much of his later work, including all of his Academy Award-labeled stuff.Sally Field is miscast as a housewife who coincidentally decides to do stand-up.  She is the weakest character of which I do not care about, nor will I ever care about. Her plight is totally meaningless compared to Hanks'.  Her stand-up delivery is forced, and seemed too much like *acting*. Yet she got slightly stronger material, and it confuses me so.The pro comedians in this film are blindsided by crappy material.  A few use their own stuff, but are still hurt by poor camera-work and bad editing. All of the acts should have been shot like a Richard Pryor concert movie. Incidentally, when not performing, all of the comedians are terrific actors. John Goodman is also superb as the supportive husband to Field.  He brings a heart, charm and sensitivity to a thankless role, and makes it easier to view the moments when she's on screen.Pre-dating Seinfeld's Comedian, Punchline is actually a good look at the lives of a stand-up.   However, when it should have been the funniest ever, in well-known fact, it is not.  Everyone in the audiences was laughing far too much and way too loud.  They may has well have been at the Apollo.  It could have been comedy gold, but instead we got silt.
