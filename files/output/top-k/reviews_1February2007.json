(A Question of Silence), she quickly became one of the most prominent and controversial feminist artists of Europe, as the unapologetic (some would say extreme) feminism of the film was seen as a very angry reaction to the women's role in society. Her next two films followed this path, and soon she was known as an interesting director to be taken seriously; although the extremism of her work and the heavy handed way she handled her subjects often diminished the true potential of her movies. In her fourth movie, Antonia, Gorris seemed to make a big departure from her first movies, as the movie offered a more complete and humanist vision of life. It certainly was an enormous progression, not only in terms of her personal ideology, but also in terms of film-making, as in this movie she showcased her talents as storyteller like never before. The five years between The Last Island and Antonia really payed off, as this movie received the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language film in 1996.Antonia is the story of well, Antonia (Willeke van Ammelrooy), a widow who returns to her home village after the World War II with her daughter Danielle (Els Dottermans), as she has received news that her mother is dying. After her mother's death, Antonia inherits the farm and along Danielle, she establishes there. And so Antonia and Danielle's new life begins at the village and, as time goes by, we witness Antonia's line to grow and develop, meeting old friends, finding new friends, and of course, gaining new enemies. The contrasting aspects of life and death, youth and decrepitude, and specially love and hate, become the key focus of the story of this community led by this strong (although often stubborn) woman. Antonia's story could easily be described as the story of the growth of a woman, and the growth of her odd family through more than three generations.Written by Marleen Gorris's herself, Antonia could be seen as the progression of Gorris' past works. While in the past she had portrayed the world almost as a constant struggle between males and females, Antonia showcases the quest for a balance between both. At its core, it is the story of Antonia, her family, and her village, growing and developing from the 50s through the 80s, and the important events in their lives; but it's also way more complex than that. It's about discovering what's important in life, and that what is important to some may not be important for others. Of course, being a Marleen Gorris' movie the relationships between male and female are of vital importance, but this time, extreme feminism is out and both genders are given a value (in an interesting change, Antonia herself must learn to love an accept a caring man). It's a clever character driven story filled with a good sense of humor, and an intelligent humanist theme.As written above, Antonia also marks Gorris' evolution to more ambitious and complex films, as while the movie is entirely character driven, the whole setting and overall composition of the movie is wonderful. Together with cinematographer Willy Stassen, Gorris makes a beautiful portrait of Europe's countryside, and accurately captures the slow but constant passing of time through the village. Jan Sewell's make-up is essential to this, as his work is of a frightening realism that one truly wonders if the cast suddenly became old for real. An interesting touch is how different the movie becomes according to the characters' points of view Antonia's scenes have a philosophical calm, while Danielle's world (as an artist) is quirky and suddenly surreal; contrasting sharply with her daughter Thérèse, who sees the world in a cold, distant and overtly scientific way.The many characters of the film are borough to life by an ensemble of both experienced and newcomer actors. Willeke van Ammelrooy is excellent in the main role as Antonia, a difficult one as her character is the one whose own personal growth becomes the basis of the rest of the film. Els Dottermans showcases her beauty and talent as Antonia's daughter, Danielle. While not the focus of the movie, her character plays a very important role in the story, and Dottermans plays the part in a very effective way. Overall the rest of the cast is remarkable (specially considering the lack of experience of some cast members), and really make the village a place so real and alive that one can't help but fall in love with the characters. While everyone makes a good job, Marina De Graaf as Deedee and the Carolien Spoor as the young Thérèse are really highlights of the film that deserve to be noticed.With its remarkably well developed screenplay and the warm touch of Gorris' direction, Antonia is truly a step forward in the director's career and an improvement over her previous work. While not a masterpiece, the movie is an upbeat movie that despite being at times emotionally manipulative, it's never annoying and really charming in its quirkiness. Critics have pointed out that Gorris' heavy handed extremism is still there, but personally I found a more mature piece of work, as if Gorris had finally exorcised her own demons and, like her Antonia, found a balance by discovering and accepting men instead of openly fighting them. Oddly, this new approach also brought criticism from Gorris' own followers, but it is in this balanced view where Antonia's main strength is, as more than being a feminism movie, it is a humanist one.Antonia is a joyful experience that, while not as deep as similar movies, it offers an interesting insight about human relationships; and despite not being exactly realist, raises interesting questions about love and unnecessary yet unavoidable battle of sexes. It seems that in 1996, the Academy got it right, Antonia is a great story. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"1 February 2007","score":"2 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" When Marleen Gorris debuted in 1982 with De Stilte Rond Christine M.

I am a hardcore Hitchcock fan and started watching oldies when I almost got deprived of good plots from modern-day flicks and started craving for more original plots.Thus, began my visual journey of great movies starting from Hitchcock's later Movies of 60s and then 50s and then 40s ..... and then 30s ! Although personally, I had a halt there on watching Movies of the 30s as I could hardly enjoy some of the movies made during that decade.But, this Movie struck me so hard that it left a great impact on my Mind. Undoubtedly, The 39 Steps(1935) remains as the greatest movie ever made till date. Its still a step ahead then other great classics such as Vertigo & North by Northwest.Amongst the many reasons why this Movie is great, are its almost flawless & moving script, precise editing & great dialogs. And finally, the impact which it creates on us through medium of various emotions of all the characters.Its a story about a Charming Young Man 'Mr. Richard hannay' played by Robert Dannat, who gets entangled in a spy chase when he tries to shelter a counter-espionage agent in his house. When the Agent is killed by the Spies, he is on his run from the Police and the killers from London all the way to Scotland country side. Almost after the second half, he gets handcuffed to the lead lady 'Pamela' played by Madelline Carol who also thinks that he is the murderer. In his aggression to claim his innocence, together both the leads continue the journey further, resolving the clues which they get, and finally arriving to the memorable end with dramatic twist.The detailed thought which was put in while drafting the screenplay of this Movie is surely remarkable. Like how Hannay directs Pamela to fill the registration book of the Hotel as he cannot write since his right hand was handcuffed to her, And Like how good Hannay delivers a great speech in a political gathering, telling only the truth, being misunderstood as a political addresser, And like the perfect handling of the conversation between Hanny and the Unhappy Housewife during their very short acquaintance, And many many more.The Beauty of the Movie is that it creates a strong bond with the viewers. We get involved into the Movie and enjoy the charm, erotism, fear & curiosity, throughout. This is the Magic of Alfred Hitchcock.Watch it on priority.

The film is full of quirkiness and a same-time embracing of geeks\/dorks as well as pitying them. We start with two semi-outcast high school students graduating high school. From then, we primarily follow Enid (Thora Birch), who finds herself in an existential phase of her life, having escaped from her hated experience, but finding herself in a meaningless and pointless world, with little direction of her own. And this is a comedy that somehow works, even when burdened by such philosophical weight.The comedy in Ghost World is not the gut-busting type, but rather the quiet situational type that's amusing. At the same time, as we laugh at the nerds, geek, freaks, dorks and dweebs that inhabit Ghost World, the film works to humanize them in our eyes and raise a sympathy for them. Suddenly their eccentricities seem less strange and more interesting. And like Enid, we find ourselves drawn to them.This film has a bit in common in terms of tone with the heavier American Splendor as well as the lighter Napoleon Dynamite, featuring an offbeat humor style and complete with curious characters. Despite the comedy, this film is a drama at its core, dealing with a youth's entry to the real world, complete with all its harshness and disappointments. As we watch the film, we see her best-friendship with Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson) tested, struggle with young love and infatuation and try to find her way in a world that doesn't feed her direction, but asks her to discover it for herself. And like many young people, she finds it very difficult to deal with the responsibility.And in the drama, we find the heart of the film, watching Enid with compassionate eyes through her struggles.Steve Buscimi completes the primary cast as Seymour, a jazz\/blues geek who Enid takes on as her first mission once she graduates, finding in him a sort of spiritual corollary. The performances are solid, with the humor played deadpan and the drama dramatic. The direction is of the classic invisible Hollywood style and the pace of the film is fine. I think the ending is a little bit of a cop-out, but I guess that's how some stories go.I thought it was a good, quirky little film and if you're a fan of those kinds of films, I'd recommend Ghost World to you. 8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"1 February 2007","score":"3 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" I was surprised to find that Ghost World is a comic book adaptation.

Nothing great, but decent entertainment. It had a cartoon feel to it that I liked. That made it easier to overlook the otherwise ridiculous things like how cars exploded for no apparent reason and people could take several kicks and punches to the face with no effect.

But they picked the wrong night for the party, because tonight the mall security robots (called killbots) have come to life and are hunting anything that moves. The only thing on sale in this mall is death.This film has some flaws, and I should be upfront about that. The acting is not great, the whole plot is a little silly. And the special effects are nothing impressive. If you've never heard of Chopping Mall, you're not alone and there's a good reason. The film falls into that so bad it's good category that tends to get overlooked until we feel the twinge of nostalgia. (Most 80s horror films can be considered so bad it's good, but unlike ones like Memorial Valley Massacre, this one at least has some heart).References to other movies are all over the place. Apparently, characters from other movies (like A Bucket of Blood) appear, though I haven't seen the other movies to confirm this firsthand. A poster for Lost Empire is visible in one scene. Mysteriously, I think I heard a character say the magic words from Army of Darkness to one of the killbots, although this predates Army of Darkness by a few years -- perhaps both are referencing something else? I saw some similarities between this and Short Circuit (such as, obviously, robots coming to life after a lightning storm and running amok). I saw a hint of Robocop here, with these robots not being altogether different from Ed-209. And, of course, the film Evolver about a robot that is similar in appearance to these killbots, that turns violent and kills the kids... so plenty of other films seem to make sense as a double feature to go with this one.Some horror veterans appear in the movie, which is always a plus for those of us who can pick out the lesser known B-list (or is it D-list?) actors. Barbara Crampton (Re-Animator) is one of the teenage girls. And Dick Miller (Gremlins) plays a janitor. And the writing\/directing combination is absurd a writer who has mainly worked on children's cartoons (G.I. Joe and Jem) and a director who does mostly soft-core pornography (The Bare Wench Project). How did these two end up making a movie? Probably something to do with producer Roger Corman... who used to direct the best horror movies ever.Some plot holes might exist if you look for them. I mean, for example, why are allegedly non-lethal robots armed with plastic explosives and lasers? Or why are they named killbots? But you're thinking too hard for this kind of film. Just sit back and enjoy such scenes are the head exploding scene... which is pretty much the only decent death scene you're going to get.I loved this movie. I think from the very beginning the creators had the idea of having as much fun as possible (the film is called Chopping Mall for Pete's sake). And the silliness, over-the-top nature and strange side comments by characters (the hecklers or the man eating butter) made me really love this movie. As of this writing, I hear the original negative is not being transferred to DVD due to some legal trouble, bu I do hope someday we see a fully-restored remastered special edition of this film... because it's going proudly on my mantle.

","genre":"Comedy, Horror, Sci-Fi"},{"date":"1 February 2007","score":"","review":" A group of teenagers decide to use a mall furniture store for an overnight party full of -- what else?? -- drinking and premarital sex. But they picked the wrong night for the party, because tonight the mall security robots (called killbots) have come to life and are hunting anything that moves. The only thing on sale in this mall is death.This film has some flaws, and I should be upfront about that. The acting is not great, the whole plot is a little silly. And the special effects are nothing impressive. If you've never heard of Chopping Mall, you're not alone and there's a good reason. The film falls into that so bad it's good category that tends to get overlooked until we feel the twinge of nostalgia. (Most 80s horror films can be considered so bad it's good, but unlike ones like Memorial Valley Massacre, this one at least has some heart).References to other movies are all over the place. Apparently, characters from other movies (like A Bucket of Blood) appear, though I haven't seen the other movies to confirm this firsthand. A poster for Lost Empire is visible in one scene. Mysteriously, I think I heard a character say the magic words from Army of Darkness to one of the killbots, although this predates Army of Darkness by a few years -- perhaps both are referencing something else? I saw some similarities between this and Short Circuit (such as, obviously, robots coming to life after a lightning storm and running amok). I saw a hint of Robocop here, with these robots not being altogether different from Ed-209. And, of course, the film Evolver about a robot that is similar in appearance to these killbots, that turns violent and kills the kids... so plenty of other films seem to make sense as a double feature to go with this one.Some horror veterans appear in the movie, which is always a plus for those of us who can pick out the lesser known B-list (or is it D-list?) actors. Barbara Crampton (Re-Animator) is one of the teenage girls. And Dick Miller (Gremlins) plays a janitor. And the writing\/directing combination is absurd a writer who has mainly worked on children's cartoons (G.I. Joe and Jem) and a director who does mostly soft-core pornography (The Bare Wench Project). How did these two end up making a movie? Probably something to do with producer Roger Corman... who used to direct the best horror movies ever.Some plot holes might exist if you look for them. I mean, for example, why are allegedly non-lethal robots armed with plastic explosives and lasers? Or why are they named killbots? But you're thinking too hard for this kind of film. Just sit back and enjoy such scenes are the head exploding scene... which is pretty much the only decent death scene you're going to get.I loved this movie. I think from the very beginning the creators had the idea of having as much fun as possible (the film is called Chopping Mall for Pete's sake). And the silliness, over-the-top nature and strange side comments by characters (the hecklers or the man eating butter) made me really love this movie.

It's a very expressionistic piece with a lot of attention to film details, such as editing, framing, camera-work, etc. that makes film geeks like me gush with enthusiasm. There's a buoyancy and an energy to almost every second of the film that makes the budget production quality seem like an enhancement rather than a problem--it's as though this film could only be made on a limited budget, using a hand-held camera, cheaper filmstock and so forth.First of all, this film is not about story or even characters in the traditional story sense, although there is a little character development, it's more about communicating the experience of the characters to the audience in a way that incorporates the entirety of the film. In that way, it reminds me of Jean-Luc Godard's Breathless. However, this film is a bit more centered on the characters' experience of getting over heartbreak and attempts to find new love amidst the heartbreak.The acting in the film is just fine, although I'd have to give the upper hand to the second half of the film's duo over the first. However, despite the solid acting overall, this film is really a director's film. Some of the tricks that director Wong Kar Wai pulls are just so perfect in capturing mood and emotion. The writing is a little unspectacular, but then again, the use of voice-over and the simplistic nature of the dialogue all help drive the experiential effect of the film.There are weaknesses in the film, like the story and the occasional moments where my suspension of disbelief is tested, but these are minor details, since the film's emotional and experiential power had me feeling quite effervescent at the end of the film.

Carrie White (flawless Sissy Spacek) is a meek, introverted teenager who is treated with irrational disdain by everyone around her. Her vile classmates mock and humiliate her at every opportunity. Her teachers either patronize her or barely acknowledge her existence (the principal, in spite of being corrected numerous times, calls her Cassie). Even worse, her own mother (Piper Laurie, who all but devours the scenery) is a man-hating, religious fanatic who forces Carrie to pray in a locked closet. Carrie's so used to being put upon, she's unaware of the fact that there are actually people who support her. One is no-nonsense gym teacher Miss Collins (stage veteran Betty Buckley), who defends Carrie against her heartless classmates. After Carrie is humiliated by the popular girls when she experiences her first period in the locker room shower, Miss Collins punishes their leader Chris Hargenston (Nancy Allen) by denying her prom ticket. Chris, a promiscuous, soulless queen bee, blames Carrie for her misfortune, so she convinces her idiot boyfriend Billy (John Travolta) to help her exact a truly despicable revenge against Carrie at the upcoming prom. It is also on that fateful day that Carrie discovers she has telekinesis, which at first frightens her but later empowers her, undoubtedly because it's the only thing in her life she has control over. Meanwhile, another unlikely supporter for Carrie is Sue Snell (Amy Irving) who's a real high school oddity a mean girl who truly regrets her nasty ways, so she attempts to make it up to Carrie by having her boyfriend Tommy (William Katt) ask Carrie to the prom. Tommy, a dim but decent sort, agrees and Carrie accepts, though not without a bit of hesitation and bewilderment. Mrs. White tries to prevent Carrie from going to the prom by nastily telling her that Tommy will stand her up and that everyone will laugh at her. The newly confident Carrie, however, refuses to be cowed again by her mother, and goes to the prom with Tommy. Carrie is euphoric at the prom and Tommy truly enjoys her company, but, thanks to Chris's cruelty, heaven immediately turns to hell. Carrie's pent-up rage is finally unleashed as a nightmarish inferno in which no one will escape. Carrie overcomes its potentially uninteresting teenage angst story thanks to Brian de Palma's direction and its well chosen cast of actors. Spaceck received an Oscar nomination for her performance; a rarity in horror films, but she truly earned it. Spacek makes Carrie a realistic, sympathetic character, and Carrie's innocence, insecurity, and ever increasing fury feel all too real. Spacek was actually in her late '20s at the time of this movie, but with her downbeat posture, wide, frightened eyes, and her long hair that she seems to use as a burqua, she does a seamless job playing the type of unpopular girl we all should have been nicer to. Spacek also does a convincing job displaying Carrie's temporary new happiness and confidence her posture is straighter, her hair shinier, and during the early prom scenes, Carrie's new-found radiance really transform her from ugly duckling to swan. It's beautiful and touching to watch, and all the more devastating, knowing how quickly it will end. Laurie seems to have too much fun playing Carrie's abusive, Bible-thumping mother, and she's easily one of cinema's most awful mothers, right up there with Mrs. Vale from Now, Voyager and Mrs. Iselin from The Manchurian Candidate. Two underrated performances come from Buckley, playing the type of teacher we all wish we had in high school (well, how many teachers nowadays would have the guts to punish the popular kids?), and Allen as the bitchy Chris. Forget Rachel McAdams in Mean Girls... Allen creates the ultimate popular girl from Hell. Chris is a foul-mouthed, gum-smacking, Bonne Belle lip gloss-wearing vixen who always seems poised to say something nasty, and even her smile is more like a sneer. She and Billy are such a hateful, dysfunctional pair that their comeuppance is Carrie's most cathartic experience. While the prom climax is indeed terrifying (and the iconic image of a blood drenched Carrie will stay with you forever), I view Carrie as more of a tragedy than a horror. Carrie is a victim of our society's prejudice against shy, quiet people. As teens we take out our petty insecurities on shy people by mocking and torturing them. As adults we overlook and dismiss them in the workplace. Over thirty years since Carrie's release, nothing has changed. That's the real tragedy.

","genre":"Drama"},{"date":"1 February 2007","score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Face\/Off tells the story of an FBI agent named Sean Archer who is in charge of taking down a dangerous terrorist named Castor Troy. Troy is also responsible for the death of Archer's son 6 years earlier. When Archer puts Troy into a coma, he discovers that there is a bomb ticking somewhere, and only Troy's brother knows where it is. Archer decides to undergo a new surgery that transforms him into Castor Troy by taking Troy's face and putting it on his head so he can find out the location of the bomb. Unfortunately, Castor wakes from his coma and forces the doctors to turn him into Sean Archer. Now Castor Troy is living with Archer's family while Archer sits in jail. He must now figure out a way to escape and convince everybody that his is who he says he is, as well as take Castor Troy down once and for all. This is an amazing action movie that's loads of fun to watch.First off, the plot of this movie is pretty cool. Originally it was meant to be set in the future, but I think the story would have been way to generic if it was. Thankfully they set it in the present day, and I think it really does the movie justice. Apart from having a really cool original story, the movie features some really awesome action sequences that for the most part are pretty believable, and for me, believable action sequences make an action movie so much better. I think there was a really good balance between actual story and the action, which is good.The acting is very good in this film. This is a perfect film to show acting range. When it starts out John Travolta is the good cop and Nicholas Cage is the sadistic maniac, and then they suddenly switch roles, and it goes off perfectly. John Travolta plays Nicholas Cage playing a psycho really well, and Nicholas Cage does a good job of playing John Travolta playing a good cop. Truthfully, I liked Nicholas Cage better in the role of Sean Archer than John Travolta, and I'm happy that was the way it was through the majority of the movie rather than vice versa.Overall, this is a great piece of work from John Woo, a really fun and entertaining action film, actually a good film all around.8\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"1 February 2007","score":"3 out of 4 people found the following review useful","review":" Face\/Off tells the story of an FBI agent named Sean Archer who is in charge of taking down a dangerous terrorist named Castor Troy.

The topic of discussion - what movies are the best ever? And the name that unanimously pops up as a strong contender for the top spot - The Godfather. With an incredible star cast, an incredible director (Francis Ford Coppola) and a strong story (Mario Puzo) this movie surely deserves all the praise that it can get.The Godfather is a three hour movie based on the life of the Italian American Mafioso based on the original novel written by Mario Puzo, who also has written the screenplay along with Coppola for the movie as well. It stars legendary and highly respected actors namely Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, etc.What makes Al Pacino's role particularly tough is the evolution and the development of his character. He starts out as a person who does not want to do anything with the family business and as circumstances change he gradually changes the direction of his life and evolves throughout the movie. And Pacino does it splendidly. Surely his acting skills are not overrated as some might feel.The story is a depiction of bitter reality, a bitter reality that was already put forward in the novel and made more accessible and imaginable in the movie. Perhaps this also explains why some haters of the movie exist. It does not offer the escape from reality many other movies seem to offer and let us face it - it is not a simple, straight story to understand. Though 3 hours in length, many viewers could watch it over and over again and each time a viewer watches it he might understand it in greater depth.The direction is near flawless. This is one huge reason why this movie is always critically on the top spot. Incredible research has been done by Copolla and Puzo in depicting the Mafia world. How does a Don think? How does he protect himself by organizing layers and layers within his empire that render him untouchable by the law? How insecure does he feel? What does he consider when he plans a move? How careful does he have to be in every step that he takes? How does he exploit the whole system around him in order to be the one controlling all the strings (please note the puppeteer's strings in the logo of the movie The Godfather)? These are some of the questions both the movie and the novel try and answer.For those of you who have read the novel, I am pretty sure most of you will not be disappointed. It is the best example of how best can a movie be made out of a splendid novel! And for those who saw this movie and liked it, I'd suggest that you read the novel as well for it shall explain in even greater depth the subtle details of the working machinery of the Mafia empire. And yes, please see The Godfather 2 as well.And may I also add in the end that the second part Godfather 2 is a fulfillment of the first. A must watch for every person who has watched part one.I am sure that this movie is going to retain the honour of its top spot and critical finesse for many years to come.
