The acting is just perfect here, each of the actors display great chemistry together on screen, they interact very well & as a result of their talent, they are able to make their well written characters all the more interesting, than what they could have been had they been played by other actors. The comedy is funny, which admittedly comes from how the characters deal with the situation & how their knowledge of killing zombies just won't work on these stiffs, in fact, RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD is to zombie films, as to what SCREAM is to slasher films, it's a self referential horror film, in which the characters know the rules in zombie films & how in other zombie movies, zombie films don't exist, so the characters don't know the rules on how to survive a zombie attack & have to work at figuring out how to stop a zombie, as they go on (usually by shooting them in the head) here however & this is what makes RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD so much fun, funny, interesting as well as original, is that zombie movies (especially Romero's zombie movies) do indeed exist, so the characters think they have the answer to stopping the zombie plague, only to discover the rules established by Romero don't work on these real world zombies! These things are indestructible, you can blow them up, chop them in pieces & they still live & still try to come after you! & while cremating them may get rid of the corpses, situations only worsen since hundred of thousands more will replace the one you cremated! About midway into the film, O' Bannon attempts to give a reason as to why the dead kill & eat brains, as the characters question a badly decomposing skeletal, female, half corpse, by tying it down on a gurney, where it explains that they need to eat brains to stop their horrible suffering of rotting away, as they can literally feel themselves rotting, it hurts to be dead, so in a way the zombies here can't really be construed as evil, anymore than a live person experiencing a certain sense of pain that uses drugs to numb the suffering they are going through, to the zombies the human brain is medicine that they desperately need to cure their pain, but this pain relief is only temporary...I found the theory very interesting, apart from a non talking, dumb zombie that just eats flesh for the sake of eating it. Since he started his career out as a screenwriter, O'Bannon knows how to construct & build a very interesting story, there are plenty of plot twists & turns in the script, interesting revelations, suspense, gore, horror, comedy, action & dramatic moments & a certain sense of comic bookishness, which coupled with the fantastic set design, soundtrack, direction & acting makes RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD the best zombie film ever made! Romero purists may bulk at such a statement, but I don't really care. O' Bannon's script just gets tighter & tighter as the film goes on, with the situation ever worsening to the point where the characters realize there never will be a way out of their horrible predicament, as they watch their friends turn on them, by becoming zombies, & even authority figure of all kinds are unable to help them. O' Bannon's script just builds & builds on the suspense & where some films would be able to balance some of the different genre's but lose footing on others, such is not the case with this movie, it's more than capable to maintain all of it's genres & balances them just perfectly. By the end, the group gets nuked by the army, an act that they think will end the zombie horror, but before the credits roll they will soon realize their method of taking care of the problem is anything truly effective, as more acid rain comes down, caused by the burning corpses, which will soon cause the dead from all over the world to rise, starting a zombie pandemic a million times worse, in the end unlike most films (& similar to the ending to NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD) there are no hero's to walk off in the sunset, no hero's left alive that was able to end the horror & save the world, in fact the world is over or is set to be over by the time the credits roll. Despite it's somewhat grim nature & ending, THE RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD is really a great time, a fun film to watch, especially with friends & despite it's repeated viewings, it never grows stale & just gets better & better after each viewing. The characters are great & one can't help but feel sad about their fates by the time the film ends. Highly recommended to all zombie fans, in fact don't dare call yourself a zombie fan unless you have seen this film! Great special effects (loved TARMAN, he's gross, slimy, scary & funny! & the half corpse looks awesome), soundtrack, acting, directing, set design & cinematography all of which make this a winner all around!

Without a great deal of luck early on, Marlowe takes another case, escorting a Mr Marriott. When Marlowe is knocked out and Marriott murdered, things begin to get more confusing. With the police suspecting him of being involved more than he is letting on, Marlowe investigates further, getting involved in other jobs for clients who want to find Moose Malloy for some reason. Murder follows murder as Marlowe finds himself right in the middle of it with only his link to Moose keeping him alive.Having recently seen a strange telling of this story in 'The Falcon Takes Over' I decided to go back and see the most famous version. Of course this actually involves going forward in time (the Falcon did it first by almost two years) but it is certainly a step up in quality as this version is much, much better since in the first version it was used as plot fodder within an existing formula. I have not read the book but for me everything works really well here with the right mix of plot, character and atmosphere. As I have admitted before, I'm not the smartest of men on this earth and, as a result, I do get confused by some of this type of film where the twisty plot is not that well explained (The Big Sleep always has me a bit spun) and here at times I was a bit unsure of who was what, but this comes good by the end and is clear with a satisfying ending to the piece. The atmosphere is tough considering the period and is more effective for being built tough on the characters and not by just writing lots of F words into the script. Dmytryk directs really well with the time honoured shadow and use of music, the camera also moves well even if some of the shots look a bit dated (well &#150; it has been sixty years this year you know).The characters are well-written and convincing. Marlowe is a dead beat &#150; cool but not so tough and together that it takes away from his status as being a downbeat. Powell is not someone who leaps to mind when I think about the noir genre but he is very good here and gets the character really spot on. Mazurki makes Malloy his own with a firm performance that shows Moose to be strong but also manipulated by the love he totally believes in. Trevor is very good, as are Shirley and Kruger. The dialogue is sharp and tough and all of them do really well with the lines and the characters they have (making them more than pigeon-holed genre clichés) but the film mostly belongs to Powell.Overall this is a very good film and is miles better than the first filmed version of this story. The film is atmospheric and looks great; the story is not afraid to risk losing the audience and is smart but pulls it all together and didn't lose me totally at any point. The dialogue is tough and quotable and is delivered by a collection of actors giving good performances, headed up by Dick Powell, doing his best to make us think of him first when we think of this story and the character of Marlowe.

Spying a young woman through his telescope, Larry goes into town and meets Gwen Conliffe, who engages him with talk of legend and werewolves. Later that night they go together to visit a gypsy fortune-teller and slip off into the seclusion of the woods, leaving their friend with Bela &#150; the gypsy. Screams draw Larry to find her being attacked by a wolf, which he attacks but is badly hurt. The police find no wolf but do find Bela with his head caved in and no bite marks on Larry to back up his story. Suspicions and rumours are rife in the village about Larry being a murderer but Larry still believes the wolf was to blame &#150; but doesn't buy the gypsy line that Bela was the wolf; that is, until he starts to get hairy feet one night.First of all, to all the people moaning about how this is 'not scary' let me just say get over it. How could this film still have the same effect on audiences today as it did back then &#150; our effects are much better and we have also seen many spoofs on the wolf man carried out by everyone from Abbot & Costello to Michael J. Fox's Teenwolf. However the film still manages to have a great atmosphere that does make it feel a bit creepy &#150; which is all I was really looking for. Having recently watched The Old Dark House, I was pleased to find that the Wolf Man actually had a narrative to speak of and, despite the familiarity of the tale, I was still into the telling and enjoyed it. It is a simple affair but it is well told &#150; even the romance is used to add to the story as opposed to being the lazy add-on it usually is.Waggner's direction is good &#150; even making the spacious woods feel tight and foreboding. Yes the werewolf looks a bit like a tall Ewok but this was over 60 years ago and I'm big enough to get past that problem. In fact I don't really have a major problem with this film because it did everything that I expected it to. Yes, it was clunky and obvious; yes, the wolf was a man in a suit and no, it didn't actually scare me; but it was still an enjoyable story nonetheless. The acting is mixed though. Rains is really good and he adds class to even his average dialogue. Chaney Jr though is not as good. His opening scenes are heavily delivered as if he was reading off a card but he does get better as he goes along. Bela Lugosi is, well, Bela Lugosi and he still overdoes the physical stuff like he always did even if he only has a few scenes here &#150; it is unmistakably him. The rest of the cast do OK but really the narrative is carried by these three (and a good Ankers) and they do well enough for this sort of film.Overall I enjoyed the film but am not blind to its weaknesses. It is not a horror as we would class them today, but it is still an atmospheric film that is effectively creepy &#150; not so much in the wolf himself but more in the build up of the story. The acting is OK even if the script often leaves much to be desired, but at least the overall story is good. Yes, it has dated but it is still worth seeing and is an enjoyable film if you meet it on its terms.

Yes, it was clunky and obvious; yes, the wolf was a man in a suit and no, it didn't actually scare me; but it was still an enjoyable story nonetheless. The acting is mixed though. Rains is really good and he adds class to even his average dialogue. Chaney Jr though is not as good. His opening scenes are heavily delivered as if he was reading off a card but he does get better as he goes along. Bela Lugosi is, well, Bela Lugosi and he still overdoes the physical stuff like he always did even if he only has a few scenes here &#150; it is unmistakably him. The rest of the cast do OK but really the narrative is carried by these three (and a good Ankers) and they do well enough for this sort of film.Overall I enjoyed the film but am not blind to its weaknesses. It is not a horror as we would class them today, but it is still an atmospheric film that is effectively creepy &#150; not so much in the wolf himself but more in the build up of the story. The acting is OK even if the script often leaves much to be desired, but at least the overall story is good. Yes, it has dated but it is still worth seeing and is an enjoyable film if you meet it on its terms.

Spying a young woman through his telescope, Larry goes into town and meets Gwen Conliffe, who engages him with talk of legend and werewolves. Later that night they go together to visit a gypsy fortune-teller and slip off into the seclusion of the woods, leaving their friend with Bela &#150; the gypsy. Screams draw Larry to find her being attacked by a wolf, which he attacks but is badly hurt. The police find no wolf but do find Bela with his head caved in and no bite marks on Larry to back up his story. Suspicions and rumours are rife in the village about Larry being a murderer but Larry still believes the wolf was to blame &#150; but doesn't buy the gypsy line that Bela was the wolf; that is, until he starts to get hairy feet one night.First of all, to all the people moaning about how this is 'not scary' let me just say get over it. How could this film still have the same effect on audiences today as it did back then &#150; our effects are much better and we have also seen many spoofs on the wolf man carried out by everyone from Abbot & Costello to Michael J. Fox's Teenwolf. However the film still manages to have a great atmosphere that does make it feel a bit creepy &#150; which is all I was really looking for. Having recently watched The Old Dark House, I was pleased to find that the Wolf Man actually had a narrative to speak of and, despite the familiarity of the tale, I was still into the telling and enjoyed it. It is a simple affair but it is well told &#150; even the romance is used to add to the story as opposed to being the lazy add-on it usually is.Waggner's direction is good &#150; even making the spacious woods feel tight and foreboding.

So i went out and picked up a few back issues, and thought that the story was instering, and dark,something different. Unfortuntley, the film does not hold up at all to the comics, in my view and is dashed with some really bad special effects and pacing.First thing thats noticeable, is the lizard skin al simmons has for flesh. Now, I'm no doctor, nor a big horror fan, but i don't think rotten decomposing burnt flesh should look like a rubber mask. To me, it should look like torn scorched flesh with ragged chunks of skin and torn ends all over the place, barly able to hold onto the skull. unfortuntley in the film, it just looks like a rubber mask and it just sucks, because it could have been gross but cool at the same time.Another thing is the films special effects. Granted, it was made back in 97, when CGI was still in the new, but i mean, common, I've seen better effects in old playstation 1 games and cheepley made fan films. I guess the effects budget was slim, but honestly, I've seen better pre production animatics and these things are finished shots? Wow, talk about bad.Also, i had problems with the pacing and acting. Spawn just came off as a pissed off black guy with a bunch of one liners, and clown was way over the top and just dumb and annoying. Granted thats how John lequozomo (sp?) does his humor, but, this was just annoying. Hell, at least jar jar binks looked somewhat realistic, clown just looks bad. Also, the film never let us soak in the plot points of the story, it was just constantly jumping around from one action scene to the next, and just throwing in plot points simply to set up the next action shot. Its just a shame because there was a good story there, but, the direction and editing just tossed it to the side line. Granted its a comic book film, but it just felt to rushed even for that type of film.Overall, spawn was a good concept that went bad.

Nightwatch has it's share of cheap thrills and a number of twists and turns in it's story but their very unconvincing in how the killer, who you can spot almost as soon as you see him, is so hard for the police to find when his actions are so insane and weird just like those of the murderer.The film-makers put two people into roles that would make you think that their the real killer of the people in the movie. One is so obvious that you just know that he didn't do it and is just a red herring put into the movie to get you and the police off the track of the real killer.

The book served as a passageway to the evil worlds beyond, it was written long ago when the seas ran red with blood. It was this blood that was used to ink the book. In the year 1300 A.D. the book disappeared. Ashley 'Ash' Williams (Bruce Campbell) along with his girlfriend Linda (Denise Bixler) are traveling by car deep into some woods to a remote mountain cabin. After some brief romantic shenanigans Ash finds a tape player. He decides to have a listen, the tape recording was made by the cabins owner Professor Raymond Knowby (John Peaks). He talks of traveling to a an ancient castle and discovering the Book of the Dead. Professor Knowby continues and explains that the Book of the Dead spoke about passageways to another world and contains demon resurrection incantations. Ash continues to listen, Professor Knowby begins to translate aloud the incantations which awake the evil spirits within the woods. All of a sudden Ash hears the sound of breaking glass and when he investigates he finds Linda has disappeared. Ash goes outside and starts to look for her, she turns up and is possessed. She attacks Ash but he chops her head off with a shovel. Ash buries Linda and quickly finds out he is trapped as the bridge he used to get to the cabin has been destroyed. He heads back to the cabin where he must try and survive to the morning and the safety of the sunlight. Meanwhile Annie Knowby (Sarah Berry) Professor Knowby's daughter and Ed Getley (Richard Domeier) have landed at a nearby airport with the missing pages from the Book of the Dead and decide to head straight for the cabin. They soon find out that the bridge has been destroyed but hire Jake (Dan Hicks) and Bobby Joe (Kassie DePaiva as Kassie Wesley) to show them to the cabin via a trail through the woods. Once there they find the cabin in a bad state, blood on the floors, a blood stained chainsaw, no sign of Annie's parents and Ash covered in blood holding a shotgun. They lock him in the fruit cellar. As the night draws on it becomes apparent that Ash isn't alone in the cellar and as the group start to be reduced in number by the evil spirits the survivors start to realize that the woods contain evil that wants to kill them all, Dead by Dawn! They must try to find a way to defeat the evil and try and save themselves. Co-written and again directed by Sam Raimi with a much improved budget, who like the original has a small cameo at the end as a medieval soldier. This is another great film, again full of cool camera tricks and angles and memorable sequences, it's no surprise Raimi has gone onto great success in Hollywood with Spider-Man (2002) and it's sequel Spider-Man 2 (2004). The script by Raimi and Scott Spiegel moves like a rocket, just the way it should but I couldn't help thinking it was a little too similar to the original, in fact I'd sooner call this a remake rather than a direct sequel. Lots of great scenes and cool one liners in this, like when Ash puts Linda's decapitated head into a vice and tightens it up, as Linda's head laughs and taunts Ash he points at it and says your going down! just before Linda's headless body bursts into the work shed and attacks Ash with a chainsaw. Or when Ash is looking at himself in a mirror after he had just killed Linda and says fine his reflection suddenly jumps out, grabs him and says I don't think so, we just cut up our girlfriend with a chainsaw, does that sound fine?!, the shot ends with Ash's reflection strangling the real Ash but the camera zooms out to reveal Ash's own hands around his throat. A sequence where the possessed Linda is dancing as her body spins around independently of her decapitated head, which remains in the same position looking towards Ash throughout the spin. A funny sequence where Ash's own possessed hand beats himself up, smashing plates and bottles over his head and punching himself in the stomach! Ash goes onto cut his hand off with a chainsaw and puts a bucket over his still alive possessed hand and puts some books on it, one of which is Ernest Hemingway's A Farewell to Arms! A really nice touch of black humor. Or the getting tooled up scene in the work shed where Ash fixes the chainsaw to his wrist and saws the barrel of his shotgun off after which the camera zooms in on his face and he quips groovy!. A short dialogue scene where Ash thinks he heard a noise in a bedroom and wanting to take a look he says we'll all go in together to which Jake answers hell no! Your the curious one. Or the shots of a stag's head over the fireplace that comes alive, turns to Ash and starts to laugh at him, and a rocking chair in the corner of the room that starts to creepily rock on it's own. Again Raimi goes overboard with the 'dead cam' point-of-view shots, and continuous unbroken shots where the evil spirits follow Ash around the cabin breaking doors down and the like, I could probably carry on but hopefully you get the idea. Acting is much improved over the original and Campbell is still great as Ash. The effects are also much better this time around, according to the booklet supplied with my DVD no less than three FX groups were brought together to make Evil Dead II work. Having said that rather disappointingly there isn't much on screen gore. When anything graphic is supposed to be happening it's usually off screen or rather tame, Ash's hand amputation is off screen, when Ash kills Linda it's in shadow, when he kills 'Evil Ed' with an axe it's mostly off screen, Bobby Joe's death isn't seen and Jake death is just a ridiculous amount of spurting blood from cellar that looks like red water. Some of the effects look dodgy particularly the stop motion animation and living severed hand sequences. The ending in which the evil is turned into a physical being I thought was a bit over ambitious and a turned out a little flat. Overall another great film, I was just a bit disappointed by the restrained gore and violence when compared to the original, by comparison in the original when Ash decapitates Linda with a shovel and her headless body falls on him, a large amount of blood from the wound squirts out all over his face. In the sequel when Ash decapitates Linda there is not a single drop of blood spilt and when Ash dismembers 'Evil Ed' when his blood splashes over the walls it's green and looks more like washing up liquid. However, I highly recommend it to horror fans and is still one hell of an entertaining horror film that's great fun at the same time. Watch it, as soon as you can.

A sequence where the possessed Linda is dancing as her body spins around independently of her decapitated head, which remains in the same position looking towards Ash throughout the spin. A funny sequence where Ash's own possessed hand beats himself up, smashing plates and bottles over his head and punching himself in the stomach! Ash goes onto cut his hand off with a chainsaw and puts a bucket over his still alive possessed hand and puts some books on it, one of which is Ernest Hemingway's A Farewell to Arms! A really nice touch of black humor. Or the getting tooled up scene in the work shed where Ash fixes the chainsaw to his wrist and saws the barrel of his shotgun off after which the camera zooms in on his face and he quips groovy!. A short dialogue scene where Ash thinks he heard a noise in a bedroom and wanting to take a look he says we'll all go in together to which Jake answers hell no! Your the curious one. Or the shots of a stag's head over the fireplace that comes alive, turns to Ash and starts to laugh at him, and a rocking chair in the corner of the room that starts to creepily rock on it's own. Again Raimi goes overboard with the 'dead cam' point-of-view shots, and continuous unbroken shots where the evil spirits follow Ash around the cabin breaking doors down and the like, I could probably carry on but hopefully you get the idea. Acting is much improved over the original and Campbell is still great as Ash. The effects are also much better this time around, according to the booklet supplied with my DVD no less than three FX groups were brought together to make Evil Dead II work. Having said that rather disappointingly there isn't much on screen gore. When anything graphic is supposed to be happening it's usually off screen or rather tame, Ash's hand amputation is off screen, when Ash kills Linda it's in shadow, when he kills 'Evil Ed' with an axe it's mostly off screen, Bobby Joe's death isn't seen and Jake death is just a ridiculous amount of spurting blood from cellar that looks like red water. Some of the effects look dodgy particularly the stop motion animation and living severed hand sequences. The ending in which the evil is turned into a physical being I thought was a bit over ambitious and a turned out a little flat. Overall another great film, I was just a bit disappointed by the restrained gore and violence when compared to the original, by comparison in the original when Ash decapitates Linda with a shovel and her headless body falls on him, a large amount of blood from the wound squirts out all over his face. In the sequel when Ash decapitates Linda there is not a single drop of blood spilt and when Ash dismembers 'Evil Ed' when his blood splashes over the walls it's green and looks more like washing up liquid. However, I highly recommend it to horror fans and is still one hell of an entertaining horror film that's great fun at the same time. Watch it, as soon as you can. ","genre":"Comedy, Fantasy, Horror"},{"date":"4 December 2004","score":"2 out of 7 people found the following review useful","review":" The opening of Evil Dead II consists of mostly a montage of shots of the Necrinomicon 'the Book of the Dead' and a spoken narration that goes, legend has it it was written by the dark one, Necrinomicon Ex Mortis roughly translated Book of the Dead. The book served as a passageway to the evil worlds beyond, it was written long ago when the seas ran red with blood. It was this blood that was used to ink the book. In the year 1300 A.D. the book disappeared. Ashley 'Ash' Williams (Bruce Campbell) along with his girlfriend Linda (Denise Bixler) are traveling by car deep into some woods to a remote mountain cabin. After some brief romantic shenanigans Ash finds a tape player. He decides to have a listen, the tape recording was made by the cabins owner Professor Raymond Knowby (John Peaks). He talks of traveling to a an ancient castle and discovering the Book of the Dead. Professor Knowby continues and explains that the Book of the Dead spoke about passageways to another world and contains demon resurrection incantations. Ash continues to listen, Professor Knowby begins to translate aloud the incantations which awake the evil spirits within the woods. All of a sudden Ash hears the sound of breaking glass and when he investigates he finds Linda has disappeared. Ash goes outside and starts to look for her, she turns up and is possessed. She attacks Ash but he chops her head off with a shovel. Ash buries Linda and quickly finds out he is trapped as the bridge he used to get to the cabin has been destroyed. He heads back to the cabin where he must try and survive to the morning and the safety of the sunlight. Meanwhile Annie Knowby (Sarah Berry) Professor Knowby's daughter and Ed Getley (Richard Domeier) have landed at a nearby airport with the missing pages from the Book of the Dead and decide to head straight for the cabin. They soon find out that the bridge has been destroyed but hire Jake (Dan Hicks) and Bobby Joe (Kassie DePaiva as Kassie Wesley) to show them to the cabin via a trail through the woods. Once there they find the cabin in a bad state, blood on the floors, a blood stained chainsaw, no sign of Annie's parents and Ash covered in blood holding a shotgun. They lock him in the fruit cellar. As the night draws on it becomes apparent that Ash isn't alone in the cellar and as the group start to be reduced in number by the evil spirits the survivors start to realize that the woods contain evil that wants to kill them all, Dead by Dawn! They must try to find a way to defeat the evil and try and save themselves. Co-written and again directed by Sam Raimi with a much improved budget, who like the original has a small cameo at the end as a medieval soldier. This is another great film, again full of cool camera tricks and angles and memorable sequences, it's no surprise Raimi has gone onto great success in Hollywood with Spider-Man (2002) and it's sequel Spider-Man 2 (2004). The script by Raimi and Scott Spiegel moves like a rocket, just the way it should but I couldn't help thinking it was a little too similar to the original, in fact I'd sooner call this a remake rather than a direct sequel. Lots of great scenes and cool one liners in this, like when Ash puts Linda's decapitated head into a vice and tightens it up, as Linda's head laughs and taunts Ash he points at it and says your going down! just before Linda's headless body bursts into the work shed and attacks Ash with a chainsaw.

The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is perhaps the best horror film ever made! It's terrifying & unnervingly suspenseful! What makes the film work is the fine performances by the cast, who really perform their roles well (Even though the characters aren't that fleshed out) & TOBE HOOPER'S direction is perfection, clever & highly original. Another thing I liked is how Tobe opens his movie up, with quick snap shots of the desecrated bodies at night, as the maniacs photograph them & then onto a shot of a badly decomposing corpse, holding a half severed skull, while wired to a large monument, followed by a shot of a dead armadillo & nothing but constant bad news on the radio, followed by a few town weirdo's & soon to be butchered farm animals, that is set the tone for what will happen as the film goes on. GUNNAR HANSEN is absolutely terrifying as Leatherface, easily the best actor to ever portray the character. No matter how many times you seen this movie (& I seen it plenty of times) Hansen's presence still scares you, even when you know what is going to happen & when & it often makes me think that with another actor portraying him, if the film would have even turned out half as good. The suspense scenes are well executed & milked for maximum impact, with the final two chase scenes both of which involve the lead heroine & Leatherface, has to be the most terrifying chase scenes ever committed to film! The films documentary like look & feel, makes this film feel awfully authentic, it feels almost like a snuff film, of an event that actually happened with the footage unearthed a few years later & that also helps make the film a cut above most, if not all horror efforts. JIM SIEDOW is perfection as the eldest brother, who switches from kind & caring, especially when the lead heroine is captured & is begging him to release her, with his face showing traces of disgust & shame & sympathy for the terrified heroine & what he & his brothers are doing & then back to the terrifying, unsympathetic lunatic his alter ego portrays. MARILYN BURNS perhaps one of the most terrific actresses to ever grace a horror film, is able to nail her part dead on. But perhaps Chainsaw's biggest accomplishment, is the fact that despite claims to the contrary, it's not anywhere near as gory, hideous, or a splatter film as we think of such these days. it's not there! Chainsaw has almost no gore on hand, with the exception of Leatherface getting his leg cut with a chainsaw, a slit finger, a knife across the arm & a bloodied Marilyn Burns at the end, some blood on the wall & on a flashlight. Like only the best horror films can do, Chainsaw has so much suspense & tension leading up to the kills & is so strong in it's execution, that when the kills do happen, their done quick & to the point, making you think you've seen a lot of violence & tons of gore on screen, when you really haven't & that's where the original Chainsaw's power lies, unlike the sequels that just cut to a close up of a gory kill, none of which are nowhere near as scary or suspenseful as this film is! & should serve as a lesson to film-makers like ADAM GREEN & ELI ROTH that you don't need tons of gore to make a truly scary, suspenseful, terrifying horror film! The kills are unique, since the victims are slaughtered like farm animals, with a sledge hammer to the head & a chainsaw cutting up a victim (In a scene that has no gore on screen, which ironically enough, despite the title, is the only kill in the movie done with a chainsaw) & a victim thrown on a hook, with the blood leaking into a metal can that is below the victim. Bodies stored in freezers to prevent the meat from spoiling etc. In fact towards the end, it is even implied that the meat that the kids buy from one of the psycho's, could indeed be the BBQ'd remains of the corpses! add to this & Hooper's horrifying dinner scene at the end, that displays several extreme close ups of people's screaming faces, howls, laughter & terrified eyes, all of which shows them descending into madness, make this an unforgettable horror classic! Don't let the title fool you into thinking this is just another brainless, drive in exploitation feature, Texas Chainsaw Massacre is anything but! The scene where the badly ageing grandfather seemingly gets his energy back, by sucking on the cut finger of the terrified heroine, is rather creepy. Fantastic, eerie score by WAYNE BELL & TOBE HOOPER, really adds to the chills & thrills this movie has to offer. Remade in 2003 (With a prequel being made to the remake) & Followed by four sequels, each of which following after Part 2, asks the viewer to ignore the sequels that came after this film, therefore it makes it really hard to classify the Chainsaw films as a series, rather than just a series of reboots trying to tie themselves to the original.

It's not really a good film in the true sense of the word, but it works well because of the charm of the actors and the fly on the wall style where there are many scenes where nothing much really happens or progressed, but you watch the characters just be themselves. Sylvester Stallone (Stanley), Paul Mace (Wimpy), Perry King (Chico) and Henry Winkler (Butchy) all play their roles with honesty and heart. It's interesting to see how the film pretty much centers around King's Chico first and foremost, with Stallone's Stanley a close second. Mace's Wimpy is there in a supporting role, and Winkler's Butchy disappears for a lot of the time. Mace and Winkler do have one good scene each without any of the other Lords around, when Mace talks with Moose Mombo in the poolhall (alone until the other Lords show up), and Winkler's talk with Eddie the egg cream guy, although this scene is pretty short. Stanley is the tough guy of the group, while Chico is the studly one, the best looking of the four (although Stanley's girlfriend is much hotter than Chico's, and they are both best girlfriends). It becomes apparent at one point that Chico is pretty much a jerk, and has a constant tension with Stanley. Chico is a jerk to Stanley before they trade hits and especially on top of the roof, where Stanley tries to communicate seriously with Chico about imagination. Actually, the last bunch of scenes of the film all revolve around Chico's inability to get along with almost anyone, from the guy dating the girl he likes, the girl herself telling him to grow up, and then with Stanley on the roof. It is a little odd seeing Chico and Stanley have all these tense moments, than seeing Chico at Stanley's wedding with his arm around him like they are the greatest of friends.Stanley is actually much more than a muscle-bound oaf, he's actually very sensitive and has a heart as well underneath the wisecracks. He doesn't have to marry his beautiful girlfriend when he finds out she's not pregnant but does anyway, and he tries to relate his ideas on traveling within your mind to Chico, who shoots him down. Stanley seems to always be the one trying to make their friendship work, even coming up with the idea of stealing a car for Chico so he'd have a better chance with Susan Blakely, the gorgeous new girl in class.None of he music is original 50's music, it's all new music made to sound like it came from that era but some of it is pretty good, especially the songs sung by the gravelly-voiced singer of the opening song.The film is gritty and more realistic because of the low production values. Especially giving the film a realistic feel is a lot of the background lines and things the actors come up with, much sounding very improvised.It was great to have this on a widescreen DVD. The short production notes inside the DVD are pretty interesting, saying that there were scenes reshot and even a whole new ending shot, because they wanted a more upbeat ending. If the original downbeat ending is still around somewhere, as well as the original scenes, they'd be great to put on a Special Edition DVD, which would make sense considering the star power of the actors. The picture on the rear of the DVD is of a scene not in the film, so that's a nice small bonus. There's also at least one thing not in the film that's on the trailer.I bought this on sale for 7 bucks, definitely a great deal.

Mace and Winkler do have one good scene each without any of the other Lords around, when Mace talks with Moose Mombo in the poolhall (alone until the other Lords show up), and Winkler's talk with Eddie the egg cream guy, although this scene is pretty short. Stanley is the tough guy of the group, while Chico is the studly one, the best looking of the four (although Stanley's girlfriend is much hotter than Chico's, and they are both best girlfriends). It becomes apparent at one point that Chico is pretty much a jerk, and has a constant tension with Stanley. Chico is a jerk to Stanley before they trade hits and especially on top of the roof, where Stanley tries to communicate seriously with Chico about imagination. Actually, the last bunch of scenes of the film all revolve around Chico's inability to get along with almost anyone, from the guy dating the girl he likes, the girl herself telling him to grow up, and then with Stanley on the roof. It is a little odd seeing Chico and Stanley have all these tense moments, than seeing Chico at Stanley's wedding with his arm around him like they are the greatest of friends.Stanley is actually much more than a muscle-bound oaf, he's actually very sensitive and has a heart as well underneath the wisecracks. He doesn't have to marry his beautiful girlfriend when he finds out she's not pregnant but does anyway, and he tries to relate his ideas on traveling within your mind to Chico, who shoots him down. Stanley seems to always be the one trying to make their friendship work, even coming up with the idea of stealing a car for Chico so he'd have a better chance with Susan Blakely, the gorgeous new girl in class.None of he music is original 50's music, it's all new music made to sound like it came from that era but some of it is pretty good, especially the songs sung by the gravelly-voiced singer of the opening song.The film is gritty and more realistic because of the low production values. Especially giving the film a realistic feel is a lot of the background lines and things the actors come up with, much sounding very improvised.It was great to have this on a widescreen DVD. The short production notes inside the DVD are pretty interesting, saying that there were scenes reshot and even a whole new ending shot, because they wanted a more upbeat ending. If the original downbeat ending is still around somewhere, as well as the original scenes, they'd be great to put on a Special Edition DVD, which would make sense considering the star power of the actors. The picture on the rear of the DVD is of a scene not in the film, so that's a nice small bonus. There's also at least one thing not in the film that's on the trailer.I bought this on sale for 7 bucks, definitely a great deal. Many DVDs go way down in price because of a looming Special Edition so who knows?

Abandoning his stolen car and fleeing across the countryside he arrives back home in Paris penniless and needing somewhere to lie low. He turns to his American girlfriend Patricia for help and she takes him in. The pair spend the next few days making love, talking and stealing cars to get enough money to get to Italy; however as the police close in on Michel he gets increasingly desperate and fed up.Having gone to the cinema earlier and suffered the American version of Taxi, I decided to try and purge the badness from my system by watching a classic or two over the next few days &#150; one of these classics was this film, which I do believe everyone who loves the cinema should try and see this at least once if only to be able to understand the wider origins and influences on the people who are currently influencing the next generation. Regardless of why you watch this, it is likely that modern audiences will not be won over by it as much as they really should be &#150; certainly people I have talked to about the film seem to wonder what all the fuss is about (one even going so far as to lament the absence of Richard Gere!). I was of course impressed by the use of the much name-dropped technique of jump-cuts but seeing them now it is easy to forget that this was new then. Away from its place in the formation of modern cinema and its influence on many modern directors, this is a great film in its own right even if the rather laid back (typically French?) telling may annoy some audiences.For me the film relies on dialogue and characters and both of these are well delivered. The film seems to have a lot of talking between the two lead characters but this work as long as you can buy into the very cool and laid back philosophising about love, literature and life. I think that in the context of Paris as it is presented here that it works very well but then I had also been in stitches over the funny short film 'J'Aime John Wayne' which spoofs the 'Gallic cool' portrayed in this film. The lead characters work well because of the dialogue but they are also very well presented by the two leads. If someone played like Belmondo today I would be the first to deride him but here he is setting the reasons why nobody can do it again by becoming an iconic figure in modern cinema. He is not so much carefree and just very ambivalent about everything &#150; America has its Rebels Without A Cause but to me Belmondo was very much a French version of a cultural rebel.Seberg is very good and makes her dialogue feel natural and convincing even though it could have been pretentious and annoying. Together they have not only chemistry but also a confidence within their own characters. Of course the direction still feels fresh today &#150; freely moving around city streets and country roads but also coming in for close ups on the actors faces. Godard continues the feel of his short films and it much better than if it had been constrained by sets on soundstages.Overall this is a great film that you should see if only so that you can say you have seen it. It may be hard to see what all the fuss is about now, because we are looking back on technical things that are now the norm, but the film is still strong on the 'normal' basis of story, directing, acting etc. The film is full of iconic images as well as a very French sense of detached cool that is very much of its time but it is also an interesting character piece with good dialogue and good performances from Seberg and Belmondo, who can't have been aware of what they were taking part in.

As it turns out, the Nazi's & Hitler have tried to re-animate dead soldiers in an effort to create an army of super soldiers, that can help them win the war. Although they are successful in re-animating them, the corpses are useless & the whole project is a complete wash. That is until they discover that the elderly puppet maker Andre Toulon has a far better formula, that re-animates his wooden puppets for his puppet shows. After killing Ilsa his beloved wife in cold blood, when he refuses to share his secrets to his re-animation formula, the Nazi's come under attack when Toulon resurrects her as Leech Woman & then sends her & the rest of the puppets out to brutally dispatch those responsible for his wife's murder, including the cold blooded Major Kraus (the late great RICHARD LYNCH) the sadistic ring leader. The film continues the tradition of adding a new puppet to the group with each new movie, this time in series mainstay Six Shooter (with six arms go figure!) ironically enough, Six Shooter was supposed to have been written into the original films script, but was oddly omitted. Though the film-makers never tell us where he was in the first two movies. What's notable is how Toulon is a good guy here (Like he seemingly was in the opening shot of the original film), played this time by GUY ROLFE (who also played another puppet maker in Producer Charles Band's DOLLS) who would continue to play Toulon in later entries, before his death. The film casts Toulon in a different light - as a tragic figure & the film continues to expand on ideas that were planted in the first two. We find here that the puppets are not just some lifeless wooden doll Toulon gave life to, but rather each puppet houses the souls of murdered people he knew in life! Ilsa would become Leech Woman, Dr. Hess a character in this film would become Blade (who was made to look like Major Kraus) & We also learn who Jester & Pin Head were (oddly Six Shooter & Tunnler's past is omitted). Again David Allen's stop motion animation puppet effects are well done & well caught on camera. The direction by David DeCoteau is superb & very well handled. That said, as much & all as I enjoyed the film, PUPPET MASTER III is nowhere near as scary as the first two (Although it is better than the original) there is no suspense or tension on hand, nor any atmosphere that helped the first two along. The puppets & Toulon are no longer bad guys, but good guys & this film is the very one that would basically spell out how the remaining chapters that followed this one would go. This is mainly due to Producer Band receiving letters from children, saying how much they loved the movies & would draw him pictures of their favourite puppet. As a result, the blood letting would not be as over the top & this film would be the last PUPPET MASTER movie that would feature the requisite sex & nudity. After this, the series would slowly but surely, become more like adventure films, with some horror around the edges, which resulted with each passing entry growing worse as they went along. Despite some of it's short comings, the film makes up for it with the story, which is arguably the best one the series has to offer. It is very interesting as are the characters & the acting is well above par for the series! in fact the film is the best reviewed by fans & critics & Producer Band would later re-visit this films storyline in latter entries, even going so far as bringing back Director DeCoteau several times, but he would never recapture the effectiveness this film had. The films continuity error continue to grow, as the film is set in 1941, yet in Part 1, Toulon kills himself in 1939!. Also we find out here that Ilsa was Leech Woman, since Toulon made her so. Then why did he think the heroine in Part II was Ilsa re-incarnated? surely he would have remembered that Leech Woman was Ilsa? & Toulon claims he learnt the magic of re- animation 15 years prior when he went to Egypt with his wife Ilsa. This too would be incorrect, since In Part II, it was 1912 when Toulon & Ilsa discovered the secrets & didn't Jester get made & given life at the beginning of the original film, a few minutes before Toulon shot himself? if so, how is he alive here?All in all, I highly recommend PUPPET MASTER III TOULON'S REVENGE, it's a very fun movie, with a story that is very easy to get hooked into & plenty of great stop motion animation & fun characters.

I was so wrong! About a Boy is an excellent film, definitely in my top five of 2002 and even more, it is in my all-time top ten. First of all it's really hard to decide what genre exactly is this film. At first sight it look more like romance comedy but after you have watched it more carefully and more than once it become obviously that About a Boy is an intelligent inspiring drama. This film is a very rare case when some comedy elements incredibly well harmonize with more important and complicated elements of drama. There are many reasons for considering this film as a masterpiece. First of all it's the script. At first it's in many parts different from the Nick Hornby's book, so some people who love the book can be disappointed, though screenwriters despite all changes were able to catch the book's atmosphere. So the story is a bit simpler and at the same time more positive than in the book. It contains lots of wit, heart and believability. This is a story about two leading characters Will and Marcus. Will (Hugh Grant character) is a 38 years old single man. His father years ago wrote a famous Christmas song and after his death Will has received the author's rights for the song and continually gets the money from them. He has never been working more than month or two in a row and his lifestyle is very simple. First every man is an island. And the second I don't care about others and no one cares about me. He spends all of his time watching TV, shopping CD and other things, stylizing his hair and dating with his girlfriends. After one of his dates he invents a new idea about dating single mothers and taking off before their relations become too serious. That seems perfect to him but when he meets 12 years old Marcus his life begin to change. I think Hugh Grant was an ideal choice for Will (in my opinion it's his best performance so far). He is always very good as a comedy actor and in About a Boy he proves his acting ability not only as a shallow comedy star. Will character could have been at least unpleasant and it is only bright charming Hugh Grant performance give us the impression that Will not as bad as he looks. There are also many minor, almost unnoticeable details which confirm such impression. Marcus is a 12 years old, smart and sensitive but gawky boy, who lives with his depressed mother Fiona (Toni Collette), perfectly played by a new rising star Nicholas Hoult. Nicholas Hoult is brilliant as Marcus. His acting is so powerful and emotional that it's impossible to look at his character without strong sympathy. Marcus easily became outcast in the school and in the whole society. He seeks a kind of refuge in Will house and while they spend time together Will learns new things about himself and take some life lessons. Will's evolution and awakening from a selfish idler to a really warm and likable character is perfectly shown through this film. These two main characters are so real that it's easy for many people to find some similarities with them. The good point is that the story never becomes predictable even for people who have read the book. Though the dialogs in the movie are quite different from the book, they are well written, funny and memorable. The music written by Badly Drawn Boy (absolutely new name for me) is quite suitable and original. It supplies some additional charms to the story. And about the comedy parts. I must say that I can't remember another film when such strong and touching drama makes you smile and laugh so many times. This film is very heartfelt and it carries lots of inspiring and smart messages. In the conclusion About a Boy is an excellent, entertained and enjoyable film, which deserves to be taken more serious than most of people did. Could this movie have been better? In conditions of such changed script that seems unlikely to me. So it's not quite a perfect adaptation of one of my favorite books but nevertheless as a movie it's almost perfect masterpiece.10 out of 10 or solid A (one of the best of the year).

I think it hit people hard as a hero film for the modern day, post-9\/11 crowd who felt that there needs to be a figure who stands for hope and overcoming obstacles. Also Marvel Films needed a comic movie about a classic character to move their ideas forward after stirring endlessly about their idea to do the Fantastic Four film.I thought that Toby Maguire did a great job as the innocent, boyish Peter Parker whose obstacles were overcome through the (un)fortunate bite of a rare spider (which the film makes seem unbelievable) which allows him to mature both physically and mentally much faster. After a ton of things happen to those he loves throughout the film, he grows up much faster than he ever thought and learns to take on these responsibilities of society to the utmost degree by becoming the hero for the city (which I believe is New York City). When his best friend's father develops a performance-enhancing process that changes him into the much-feared Green Goblin, Maguire's Spiderman has to juggle those that he loves, hates, and is obliged to save from harm in the city.Kirsten Dunst played the lovable Mary Jane (too bad Rick James couldn't license his song for the movie...that would've been funny.) She plays the sappy love-interest-role quite sappy indeed, but she's hot enough to get your mind off her acting. Willem Dafoe played a schizo-green goblin whose mind was torn between what was good for himself and what might potentially gain him solace for losing his company and lifestyle forever. Seeing J.K. Simmons as Mr. Jameson, the newspaper boss, was great because he looked like he always had in the comic book.

It's clear that her presence dominates the movie; however, there are some excellent supporting players, including Kay Medford as Fanny Brice's mother Rose and Walter Pigeon as Florenz Ziegfeld, two very fine character actors. Rose is particularly likable because, unlike her daughter Fanny, she sees things as they are and not the way they should be. This applies to her comment about Nick Arnstein, the handsome gambler that Fanny marries, despite the fact that Rose perceives him to be a sponge.Fanny, as shown in this film, is also very likable not only because of her humor but for her generosity and thoughtfulness. Her ambition, of course, is to conquer the stage and she does so fairly quickly after making a great mess of a roller skate number at the local dance hall. Before long, Fanny is auditioning for Ziegfeld, the famous impressario and she wins him over with her talent and charm. Nick Arnstein, a man about town, always seems to be around Fanny when she triumphs on the stage and this time is no different. He buys her a beautiful bouquet of roses with a note, Dear Star, I told you so. Very soon, Fanny and Nick become involved in a relationship which is often on and off until Fanny literally proposes to him. What follows is a heartbreaking story of a young woman whose desire to be loved for herself alone and her passion for a happy domestic life is thwarted by fate and some wrong choices. After a montage of the first year of their marriage together, problems start affecting the Arnstein marriage. It is true that they are wealthy people; however, their problems aren't minor. Nick begins to lose heavily at the gaming table and everything he tries ends in failure. Fanny, on the other hand, continues to be successful on the stage and Nick starts to resent her. Suddenly, all of his gentlemanly charm and good manners disappear as if by magic; he's rude to Fanny, making her upset over things that a truly married couple would find a way to resolve. Indeed, he starts ignoring her deliberately and places his interests and needs above hers. After a while, the marriage collapses not because of Fanny's career but the way in which Nick looks at their relationship (we discover this near the end of the film.) He also conceals his financial problems from her, shutting Fanny out of his life as though she didn't exist. All of this culminates in Nick's unfortunate involvement in a shady bond scheme which sends him to prison for two years. I would say that these problems are rather huge. I don't want to give more away because I feel others should have the opportunity to see the film and judge for themselves. But I have to say that the ending of the movie, is, in my opinion, one of the most heartfelt, dignified, and classiest moments ever put on film.
