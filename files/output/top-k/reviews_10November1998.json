The very fact that the little Giuseppe survives with so little trouble is hardly acceptable when one knows how mercilessly children were exterminated.

Anyway, this gave it all a great sense of realism and made these cartoons look lifelike, greatly adding to the audience believing in what they were watching. Not necessarily aimed at kids, in fact, probably not at all, what with the ageing Woody Allen barely known to those under 15, he was a perfect example of himself as we all know and love him - and starring alongside Stallone and Stone, with Dan Akroyd, Christopher Walken and Danny Glover all adding to the A-List name-dropping. All well worth their parts.

That said, I found it to be an entertaining way to spend two hours of my life. Certainly, there were instances where the dialogue fell extraordinarily flat, but the movie had many impressive visual achievements that drew attention away from a shaky transition in tone and an unsatisfactory resolution. I was impressed with the cast, but the attempt to tell several stories at once left me with no real character on whom to focus. I thought the plot was a little too clever for its own good, but it was clever, and that's more than one can say for a large percentage of what's out there. Joan Allen is given the most to do, and she acquits herself admirably; Reese Witherspoon is not given enough to do, which is a shame; Tobey Maguire's character is the least fully realized (I cringed every time his character just stood wide-eyed and slack-jawed while everything happened around him, which is pretty much the entire movie), but he does a good job with what he's given. Although I found this movie entertaining, I feel like it didn't control its theme enough, and most of the pleasures in it were incidentals. The climactic trial scene works, minus any sense of actual resolution. And did I mention the tone? The last movie I saw that was this schizophrenic in tone was Carrie, which made it work in its favor more than this one does. Ultimately, I'll recommend this movie; don't expect too much and you won't be let down.

So I was ready for the genuine widescreen, three-strip Technicolor movie-theatre experience.The result well, it was like having known about the man behind the curtain but not accepting it until now. I'm old enough to see the poor continuity (the Tin Man's funnel-hat handle switches sides at least once), the primitive make-up, the once-magical backgrounds that are now clearly movie sets,  that Dorothy had quite a rack for a twelve-year-old;-),and so on.

Oh, the COLORS the burnt fuschia of the hourglass sand, the genuine ruby of Dorothy's slippers, the repulsive green of the Witch's skin versus the entire green spectrum in the Emerald City. And there's nothing like seeing it with an adult audience old enough to know all the lines and all the lyrics, booing and clapping and cheering right on cue (and laughing heartily where we never dared laugh before).
