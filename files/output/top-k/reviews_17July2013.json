This movie is a masterpiece and clearly one of my favorites. The characters are all great in their respected roles and the one thing I particularly loved was that Anastasia, even though she found her family and remembered her past, she gave back the crown so she could be with the one she loved. How many other 'princesses' have done that?? It's a refreshing end! The songs are hauntingly beautiful - so beautiful I went out and bought the album.

And in the background just between the legs of Lee's horse you see Luke the Doc Mcpharil tending the wounded. And that there is... Henry smiled, You see that picture?Oh my...You can stop now. Henry grabbed Kristls arm, You made your point.It is so boring.They should make two movies one for the civil war buffs and another for the rest of the world. That last one should be the first but cut by half and arranged around Jeff Daniels. And perhaps throw in some maps so we have an idea where he is. Kristl said.HmmThere is almost no dialogue; mostly speeches. The kind where they stare into the distance as if it is the future and they say something like this battle will be remembered by future generations because they will know we stood here with proud hearts... etc.They did it all the time and that is why most battles were such muddled affairs. Henry saidCommander.. what are your orders? Henry mimicked a voice with southern accent..Sorry soldier, got to ride to yonder hill to make a speech meant for destiny!

Which can only truly be evaluated when watching another movie which is called Civil War reenactment documentary. About everyone interviewed must have been about thirty pounds heavier than their civil war counterparts. Which is probably why you never see them much up close. If they could learn anything of this is that the civil war soldier was more likely to die from a bullet than from obesity, while now it is probably the other way around. Kristl shrugged, I can not understand why people want to reenact warfare. Especially when it gets pervaded with an air of snobbery like we are doing something worthwhile here, while you are doing not. If you want delve into history as part your identity crisis there are so many peaceful ways.Ah peaceful. Nobody makes a movie about non-violent stuff, because nobody wants to watch it. This is guys playing with guns and someone once said never get between a man and his gun..Oh my god. I bet it was John Wayne.You're a man or you're are not. Henry grinned.Wait a moment Kristl grabbed her mobile and started to press the keys.What are you doing?I get you a few pizzas. With about thirty pounds extra on that frame of yours, you might blend in with the reenactment community. Then put on any old rags you can find and pass yourself off as a confederate soldier. You play with guns and act all snobbery because you have something of historical value to pass on, while all the while you are nothing better than other people playing video games, drawing pictures, doing origami, climbing mountains or watching horror movies. Cause the only thing a war learns is that it is a horrible affair that should be avoided because it kills people.Uhm. You are quite vehement. Henry was taken aback .Yes. And I will tell you why. I happen to have been so stupid to spend most of life on the study of warfare. Now you think 620.000 people is much. Compare that to the Taiping Rebellion at roughly the same time. It killed at least fifty times as many people and might even have killed a hundred times more. And this was no warfare in which women and children were spared. No, everyone was killed cities destroyed and countries wasted. It was total war. And I doubt you will find anyone willing to reenact that. Now if some fat civil war reenactor wants to learn something from his past, he might at least learn to eat less and exercise more, because that war is a horrible thing is apparently lost on him. And, overcome with emotion, Kristl stormed out.Henry listened to the door shutting and thought that letting Kristl cool down was the wisest thing to do.

JJ's Verdict What makes Apollo 13 greater than the majority of the 'based on a true story' is that the film is a true story. It takes very few liberties (only a few lines of dialogue) and in doing so, creates a genuine and realistic tone, which is certain to entertain anyone because each event depicted on screen actually happened. Apollo 13 is the telling of the true story of three astronauts flying to the moon who are forced to abandon their mission and return to Earth after their spacecraft starts to play up and get rid of the majority of their oxygen supply. The three are forced to go to the most extreme survival techniques as Mission Control desperately attempt to find a way to get the trio back home before it is too late. When watching Apollo 13, the film manages to wipe your mind of any previous opinions you had on whether you believe the story of the moon landings or not. When you are there in that moment watching it, you believe everything the film presents to you. You believe the 1969 moon landings and you believe that the failed Apollo 12 and 13 missions happened by accident; not intentionally sabotaged by the U.S government. It makes you want to find out about the mission itself and the people involved. It is only strong filmmaking that can do both of these to the viewer. From the moment Tom Hanks utters those now immortal lines Houston, we have a problem, Apollo 13 is no longer about a space mission. It is about the strength of humans and their will to survive when all seems lost and the worst might still be to come. It is about reflection on what could have been. If they had actually reached the moon. The special effects are so subtle and real that you rarely notice them and you become engrossed in the crew's epic survival; not a special effects frenzy. If modern blockbusters did this then I am sure we would realise how shockingly horrendous they actually are as the wooden acting and poor dialogue and story would have nothing to hide behind. Today special effects are just there to disguise the film's weak points but in Apollo 13, Ron Howard doesn't even want or expects us to look at the special effects. Just the engrossing drama on centre-screen. This isn't to say special effects are bad. The Star Wars and Terminator are films are among my favourite. I just wish we could have more character dramas like Apollo 13 appealing to a mainstream audience and smashing box-offices records, not just effect driven sequels and spin-offs. Not only does it have brilliant filmmakers but also, Apollo 13 is blessed with five of the best actors of their generation taking lead roles. Tom Hanks is Jim Lovell, all-American hero who ultimate goal is to reach the moon, Kevin Bacon is Jack Swigert, womanising charmer who is pulled in to Apollo 13 late, Bill Paxton is Fred Haise, arrogant on the outside but weak in the inside, Gary Sinise is ken Mattingly, lonely and insecure who is forced to abandon space program after getting the 'measles' and Ed Harris is Flight Director Gene Kranz, demanding of his co- workers and calmingly confident. Hanks, Bacon and Paxton all bring their own acting style to the equation and are all equally charming at the start but scared and worried at the end. Gary Sinise is perfectly cast a Mattingly who ended up having to give up his place on the mission. Sinise captures his characters loneliness and reluctance to accept his fate. Ed Harris' Gene Kranz is strong-minded and full-on and in doing so gives us an endlessly quotable character with lines like 'We've never lost an American in space, we're sure as hell not gonna lose one on my watch! Failure is not an option' and I don't care about what anything was designed to do, I care about what it can do.' Harris was in fact nominated for an Oscar for his role and would have won had it not been for Kevin Spacey's haunting performance in Bryan Singer's The Usual Suspects.Apollo 13 is masterpiece of acting, design and storytelling. Almost all the dialogue is unaltered from actual events as are each and every scene. Ron Howard's masterpiece will leave you sweating in hope, despair and expectation. You'll question how they actually survived, but Apollo 13 happened and what better way to remember it than make a truly magnificent film about it. In fact, Apollo 13 isn't about the events but is the events. A magnificent achievement from everyone involved.

Tom Hanks is Jim Lovell, all-American hero who ultimate goal is to reach the moon, Kevin Bacon is Jack Swigert, womanising charmer who is pulled in to Apollo 13 late, Bill Paxton is Fred Haise, arrogant on the outside but weak in the inside, Gary Sinise is ken Mattingly, lonely and insecure who is forced to abandon space program after getting the 'measles' and Ed Harris is Flight Director Gene Kranz, demanding of his co- workers and calmingly confident. Hanks, Bacon and Paxton all bring their own acting style to the equation and are all equally charming at the start but scared and worried at the end. Gary Sinise is perfectly cast a Mattingly who ended up having to give up his place on the mission. Sinise captures his characters loneliness and reluctance to accept his fate. Ed Harris' Gene Kranz is strong-minded and full-on and in doing so gives us an endlessly quotable character with lines like 'We've never lost an American in space, we're sure as hell not gonna lose one on my watch! Failure is not an option' and I don't care about what anything was designed to do, I care about what it can do.' Harris was in fact nominated for an Oscar for his role and would have won had it not been for Kevin Spacey's haunting performance in Bryan Singer's The Usual Suspects.Apollo 13 is masterpiece of acting, design and storytelling.

JJ's Verdict What makes Apollo 13 greater than the majority of the 'based on a true story' is that the film is a true story. It takes very few liberties (only a few lines of dialogue) and in doing so, creates a genuine and realistic tone, which is certain to entertain anyone because each event depicted on screen actually happened. Apollo 13 is the telling of the true story of three astronauts flying to the moon who are forced to abandon their mission and return to Earth after their spacecraft starts to play up and get rid of the majority of their oxygen supply. The three are forced to go to the most extreme survival techniques as Mission Control desperately attempt to find a way to get the trio back home before it is too late. When watching Apollo 13, the film manages to wipe your mind of any previous opinions you had on whether you believe the story of the moon landings or not. When you are there in that moment watching it, you believe everything the film presents to you. You believe the 1969 moon landings and you believe that the failed Apollo 12 and 13 missions happened by accident; not intentionally sabotaged by the U.S government. It makes you want to find out about the mission itself and the people involved. It is only strong filmmaking that can do both of these to the viewer. From the moment Tom Hanks utters those now immortal lines Houston, we have a problem, Apollo 13 is no longer about a space mission. It is about the strength of humans and their will to survive when all seems lost and the worst might still be to come. It is about reflection on what could have been. If they had actually reached the moon. The special effects are so subtle and real that you rarely notice them and you become engrossed in the crew's epic survival; not a special effects frenzy. If modern blockbusters did this then I am sure we would realise how shockingly horrendous they actually are as the wooden acting and poor dialogue and story would have nothing to hide behind. Today special effects are just there to disguise the film's weak points but in Apollo 13, Ron Howard doesn't even want or expects us to look at the special effects. Just the engrossing drama on centre-screen. This isn't to say special effects are bad. The Star Wars and Terminator are films are among my favourite. I just wish we could have more character dramas like Apollo 13 appealing to a mainstream audience and smashing box-offices records, not just effect driven sequels and spin-offs. Not only does it have brilliant filmmakers but also, Apollo 13 is blessed with five of the best actors of their generation taking lead roles.

A pointless cameo appearance from Jamie Lee Curtis reveals that the decapitated body at the end of the dreadful 'Halloween H20' wasn't Michael Myers after all, but a mute paramedic wearing the iconic white mask (he didn't get out of the cockadoodie car). From this desperate revelation the movie somehow manages to skid further downhill, as once Curtis finally exits the series thanks to a laughable scene in which she captures Michael and then does something incredibly stupid, the film becomes a ham-fisted medley of moments from 'Blair Witch', 'Aliens' and every slasher movie you've ever seen.The plot internet entrepreneur Busta Rhymes (likeable at first, awful later on) ensconces a group of kids in Myers's childhood home on Halloween, fits their anodyne heads with mini-cameras, adds a fake Myers stand-in and broadcasts the results to the internet. Presumably the scenes in which viewers scream and shout when the real Myers turns up are intended as a meta-commentary on the film's events, but unfortunately for hack director Rick Rosenthal, who also perpetrated 'Halloween II', the real audience is more likely to roll over and go to sleep because he's made a boring, clichéd, dopey, ineffective lump of a film that ends the series not with a whimper but a bilious splutter.

I won't even label it as a guilty pleasure; I have no guilt in my pleasure in laughing out loud every time I watch this.Actually, it's probably been two decades since I last viewed this and though I remember watching it back then repeatedly, this viewing brought back everything. I could all-but recite every line, every joke and see everything coming two chapters ahead. And that's not a bad thing; I still laughed out loud all over again in a movie that's 25-years-old this September.(And speaking of which &#x96; where is the 25th Anniversary BluRay Special Edition for this absolute classic?)It helps that I used to watch her show, about her hosting and commenting on terribly bad and unintentionally hilarious B-movies, live &#x96; and watched it for different reasons most boys did my age. It also helps that I transitioned, following her, into Mystery Science Theater 3000. But, none of that accounts for the full-movie she helped write here. In fact, aside from the opening act (the set-up,) a few mentions of movies she likes, a brief live-edition in the midsection and the spoof of making a movie mimicking her B-movies, the movie really stands on its own.Yeah, that didn't come out right.

Yet, I find it to be one of the greatest Disney film of all time. Why? Well for starters Disney took A LOT of risk with this movie. Instead of making it bright, colorful, and family friendly, Hunchback is dark, gritty, and surprisingly has a lot of mature themes. I'm sure everyone is familiar with the story. It's about a disfigured man named Quasimodo who lives on top of the bell towers of Notre Damme for all his life because according to his master, Claude Frollo, his kind is not welcomed in the streets of Paris and therefore he must spend the rest of his life isolated at the bells of Notre Dame. What made this movie so great however is because it defied the laws of Disney. In a sense, it did the same thing Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy did, by taking a familiar material and making it darker and thematic. But why do so many people hate Hunchback? It did the same thing the Dark Knight did, hell it even came out before the Dark Knight. But why does everyone like the Dark Knight but not Hunchback? Why is it forgotten? Well, maybe it's because it's a Disney Movie. Maybe people were tired of the way superheroes and needed a change to the traditional campy feel of superhero movies and were happy with the changes that The Dark Knight offered. When people watch a Disney movie, they expect a colorful movie that's fit for the family. Not a dark film about a disfigured man that is shunned from society. You expect that from Tim Burton, not Disney. Yet again, being different isn't always bad. I'll admit, I didn't like Hunchback that much as a kid either, and it wasn't until a more recent viewing that I came to respect it. And On top of that, who could forget the most famous aspect of this movie; the villain. To describe Judge Claude Frollo would be impossible for he is far to complex and I wouldn't be able to do him justice. But one things for sure, he's perhaps one of the greatest villain that Disney created. What about the songs? For the most part, the songs were pretty good, great actually. Particularly the opening theme and the villain song. So overall, I say go check it out. It's definitely not for everybody, but if you're looking for something different or if you like a movie with a little dark twist, then you should definitely go see it.

However, here is the list of what really annoyed me- The amount of highly predictable scenes.- The lack of adequate caution on things that even with regular wild animals is done much more safely, such as the first velociraptor scene, when some men are about to transfer a raptor out of a cage, which is neither properly attached to the outer fence, neither has an electric door.- The irritating hysteric girl (sorry, I had to mention it), which not only was completely misinformed about dinosaurs (despite being a self-proclaimed hacker) and insisted on using words such as veggie-saur, instead of herbivore and carnivore.- The complete lack of common-sense shown by some characters, such as their cumbersome ability to get out of the trail, and split themselves.- The fact that although a big storm was about to reach the island, the tour was not interrupted, even when the safety of the passengers (not only Hammond's grandchildren, but the ingen's inspector as well) could be on risk.- The cars are constraint to a rail, although they run on batteries, which run out. It would be more plausible to just make the rail electrified.

Most notably for me, this is the first Bond film to formally drop the ball &#x96; something which was being threatened with each passing minute from around the hour mark of Goldfinger and has here burst forth into a torrent of overly used second unit material; poor atmospherics; bad pacing and generally weak levels of antagonism. I suppose it had to happen eventually, but there doesn't seem to be much energy to this entry; much urgency &#x96; people are spending too much time under the Bahaman sun and it's stifling them. Where the frame should be dripping with this tension born out of an impending deadline, there is a stoic and clammy feel to things; a degree of repetition. You might say that when the stakes go higher, the interest wanes where the assumption is it should intensify. Watching Bond investigate the death of a fellow overseas operative or being caught up in a plot to do with a Soviet encoder may not have the same enigmatic 'ring' that trying to stop World War Three does, but it's a damn sight more interesting.Then there is the water. Water plays a large part in Thunderball. This is not the Bond film for the aquaphobes among us - has indeed anyone mentioned that there is a lot of water in this film? Sequence after sequence, scene after scene set beneath the waves wherein people swim; glance; investigate and, on occasion, both fight and murder those in close proximity to them. From the moment the camera is drenched with the liquid that spews forth from the rear of James Bond's automobile during his successful evasion from some baddies during the opening, we are practically inundated with our beloved Hydrogen-squared-over-Oxygen for the rest of the picture. As it was with those aforementioned crooks during the film's pre-titles sequence, the happening is, with hindsight, a sort of slap in the face for the audience all unto itself an announcing that there will be an awful lot of this on your screen for the next two hours, so buckle up and get used to it.We begin, following the opening salvo, in Paris and with a cross dissolve involving blue and red fountains of water streams filling in with the white\/grey of a Parisian street as we open in France to the French colours. Neat. There enters the frame the villain of the piece, Emile Largo (Celi), who parks his car; waltzes nonchalantly across the road and into a building occupied by people being barracked at by the French authorities over varying issues. Above such meagre matters, Largo continues on down the corridors before he reaches a board room preordained by SPECTRE, the recurrent terrorist cell charged with facilitating all the grief thus far in the franchise and seemingly providing Bond with a living.The blunt fact of the matter is that Largo is a poor villain; a podgy, one eyed thug who isn't even so much a villain as much as he is an overly-qualified henchman to the SPECTRE organisation in the first place. At this crucial time in the film, as we're introduced to whom it is Bond will be up against, it is a betrayal within SPECTRE which reminds us of their cutting, brutal efficiency where Largo can merely stand around and provide a brief lecture on an up-coming plan. Largo is, in fact, so poor that I indeed had to remind myself of whom HIS henchman was. If we're going down this route of gadgets; girls; locations; villains and their backup as a means to really get involved in a Bond film, then why is Largo himself no more than a droll rent-a-thug who possesses a nondescript back up lackey in Vargas? A better villain is Fiona Volpe (Paluzzi), a quite stunning visual specimen whose sexual appeal; aggression and involvement, epitomised when they are clay pigeon shooting and she puts him in his place with a series of lines of dialogue, has her stand out more.The plan this time involves some neat back-story revolving around a top fighter jet pilot; his kidnapped sister Domino (Auger) and the transportation of some nuclear devices, devices of which eventually fall into Largo's hands as he and SPECTRE hold the West to ransom. Fortunately, Bond has a lead on account of his time spent at a health clinic and it isn't long until he's in Nassau looking to crack the case. Unfortunately, however, is the manner in which the whole thing comes across as quite flat. There is little sense of two sides warring with one another that there was in Jamaica or Istanbul as before, while the locale of Nassau with its bikini-clad women and photogenic nature undercuts the severity of the situation just as setting a neo-noir in somewhere such as Monte Carlo or Las Vegas often undermines the harsh, unremitting atmosphere of said genre with a frothier, warmer, bouncier tone. It's easy to admire the craft of it, but the second unit material is often overwhelming - so much so that by the time the huge fight between good and evil arrives at the very end, we're so worn out by the preceding hundred minutes that it's all too much of a muchness. There's too much of an in-betweener feel about Thunderball, like it was hurried or rushed; like the producers focused too much on what made the backgrounds of the preceding films so likable without any attention paid to the fore.

She was brilliant here and that's not to say the others, like the absolutely hilarious Harvey Fierstein or very good Matthew Broderick, weren't deserving&#x85;but she literally stole every scene and ate up her role, in a good way.Sure, she was like my own mother, in regards to her stance and some of her words &#x96; just not the enormously vocal and flamboyant flair, and she was wrong in her bigotry, but she was excellent in her disapproving Jewish mother role.Not maybe &#x96; this is why I loved this movie as a young adult and literally watched it once a month or two for a couple of years I was just coming out when I first got my hands on this and I could relate and root for and cheer and weep and ride right along with Fierstein's creation Arnold Beckoff. He was a drag queen, I was not, but that was the one difference. He had a bottomless heart, insecure enough to allow others to control his life, spoke with a straight edged deadpan wit, looked for love over lust and kept his head up inside even when he continuously got knocked down. I felt &#x96; and still do, I was him.This movie's beautiful from beginning to end. The drama parts, the longing, the loves, that is. The comedy, lines and reactions are as equally entertaining. The two blended so well and moved us alongside Arnold's life and tribulations wonderfully.Torch Song Trilogy tells the tale of performer (well, drag queen) Arnold, living alone, afraid of his mother, approved by his brother and seeking his way in NYC by trying to be his own person when he's rejected in a time frame (the 1970s) when gays were just that.First he meets Ed, who's confused, somewhat straight but Arnold falls head of heels over. Then when that ends, he meets Alan who is the epitome of true love and an all around great guy. Then, Arnold finally meets his mother, metaphorically speaking. I believe that is the trilogy of the title. Oh, and Arnold adopts a son in there, too, and that might be his third love of his life&#x85;Honestly, I never tried to find true or deeper meaning in this film than what it meant to me just as I was coming out. Now, in 2013, I'm long past that. I still feel his plight, still laugh at the jokes and absolute uproarious banter and smart lines.I'm not sure if this movie could be for a wide audience, but I wish it would.
