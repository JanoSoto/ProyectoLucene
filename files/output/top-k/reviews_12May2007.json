And I'm proud to say that this movie has never lost its luster and excitement every time I watch it. The plot itself is a stroke of genius, well-followed by an ending that I can only describe quoting my best friend, who said it was a kick in the balls. A crude way to describe it, but it was very apt; I can still recall how my eyes had first widened when the interrogation was coming to a close but I remember more vividly of how my jaw had hung as if someone loosened every screw in my head when I saw the ending.The Usual Suspects is not only one of the best movies by far, but I think it sets a standard for any criminal-related movie that seems to be ignored a lot of the time. It's a story of power and manipulation, true guts and will and cunning and cleverness - all characteristics of what I believe to be the perfect criminal. And five crooks, all of who have their own very, very distinct personalities, quirks, and stories that you just can't help but admire and laugh with\/at simultaneously. Bryan Singer did a very good job with this movie and that includes all the hiccups from the actors that he worked with --- personally, I wouldn't have had it any other way. You get the moments of chuckles and of surprise throughout the movie and times where you can't help but express sympathy for the characters, especially for Dean Keaton (at least for me, anyway).When you watch this movie, keep in mind it is not just for light enjoyment like you'd see from any other 2-3.5 star movie that Hollywood likes to put out these days.

I guess if the story has a moral to it, it's that for one star in 'shimmering firmament' to be born one has to die. It can be a funny end like what happens to Lina Lamont in Singing in the Rain or it can be a tragic tale as what happens to Norman Maine in this film. But Kathy Selden and Vicki Lester do go on.Esther Blodgett as played by Janet Gaynor is a symbol for all the young people, women in this case, who dream of seeing themselves on the big screen. Encouraged morally and financially by her grandmother May Robson, Gaynor goes to Hollywood and experiences all the frustrations of a young hopeful. But fate is on her side in the person of leading man Norman Maine, played by Fredric March in one of his best screen performances.Though Gaynor and March were both nominated for Gaynor the part of Esther Blodgett\/Vicki Lester was no stretch for her. She'd been doing the part of fresh small town girls for most of her screen career, this being the best of them. For March however, he has to play a weak character, something he had not really tackled before.I guess Hollywood knows itself better than anyone else and films about the industry can be scathing. The star is a creature with a fragile ego, one moment a whim can move mountains, a slip in public affections and no one wants to know you. March as Maine has been slipping for some time and he catches on, way too late. But as March is going down, Gaynor is on the up escalator and they meet mid point and fall in love. How they deal with their joint careers or lack thereof in one case is what A Star is Born is all about. March and Gaynor get good support from Adolphe Menjou as an understanding producer, Andy Devine as Gaynor's fellow boarder at her place of residence and most of all from Lionel Stander as the cynical press agent who inadvertently puts the finish to March's career.Gaynor's final moment on the screen is one of the great classic events as she proclaims to the world she's Mrs. Norman Maine. And why March does what he does is will start an endless discussion of speculation. Watch this film and come to your own conclusion.

He has four sons Santino Sonny (James Caan), Frederico Fredo (John Cazele) Michael (Al Pacino), his adopted son Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), who serves as the family consigliere, and a daughter, Connie (Talia Shire). Sonny is the underboss of the family. With Peter Clemenza (Richard Castellano) and Salvatore Tessio (Abe Vigoda) are the caporegimes. Soldiers under Clemenza and Tessio include Paulie Gatto (Joe Martino), Willy Cici (Joe Spinelli) and Rocco Lampone (Tom Rosqui), and more. Michael wants nothing to do with the family and attempts to legitimize himself by going to college and the army, while his brothers are trying very hard to establish their names in the city through the Mafia underworld.The Corleone family soon become engaged in a ten-year war against the other families. They nearly slip from power. But they stand their ground and fight for their power.The Godfather is based on the bestselling novel by Mario Puzo, who co-wrote the screenplay with director Francis Ford Coppola. The movie remains about 90% true to Puzo's masterpiece of a book, only tossing out flashback scenes (which are instead moved into The Godfather Part II) and killing off two characters that weren't killed in the book.The Godfather has earned its place in cinema history, it is considered a landmark film. This is a movie about family and careers. Not an accurate picture of a gangster's life, but still one of the greatest movies based around the Mafia. For an accurate look at mob life, watch Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas or Mike Newell's Donnie Brasco. The movie also started James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Al Pacino's careers.

There are many other familiar faces from Scorsese's film Goodfellas his prior mafia epic. Like Goodfellas this film is filled with the violence and seedy, yet classy environment of the underworld.The basic plot is that Sam is a good handicapper who is given control of a new casino, the Tangiers, which is bankrolled by the Kansas City mafia. He moves out to Las Vegas to run the place, and he runs it very well, keeping out scam artists and cheaters. After a while, he becomes romantically involved with Ginger, a respected hustler who makes her rounds in Vegas, but has a troubled personality and history. He is later joined by his gangster pal Nicky Santoro, who moves out to Vegas with the intentions of conquering the city's criminal rackets.Another good thing about the film is its soundtrack. Since the film takes place in the 1960s and 1970s, we are treated to all sorts of great music from classic artists. The soundtrack occupies two compact discs, giving you an idea of how much of a role the music plays in this movie.This film also features what I consider one of the greatest opening credits sequences of all time. The camera rolls over waves of flashing lights, which represent the flashiness that Vegas is all about. The only complaint that I have about the beginning of the movie is the scene where a car explodes and a dummy is painfully visible in the front seat. Marty, how on earth could you have missed this?! De Niro really carries his role well. He plays a real tough guy, but at the same time we see how vulnerable he is to women. Despite his questionable background, he wants to play the casino straight and not get involved in any activities that could get him removed by the gaming board this is arguably one of De Niro's finest performances This is also Sharon Stone's best performances, She plays the role of the drugged up wife very convincingly, with very real emotion. We watch with horror as she goes from being a classy hustler to a bored housewife with a severe drug problem with a certain horror Stone surprises in this film and was fully deserving of the Oscar nom But im afraid the real show stealer here is Joe Pesci who gives out an amazing and hilarious, yet disturbing performance as Nicky Santoro. At the beginning of the film, he is a lowly gangster, but by the end of the film he has created his own criminal empire and exhibits a lot of power in a scary way. His performance in this film is very similar to the one he gave in Goodfellas, with essentially the same explosive personality, although quite a bit darker he should have won the Oscar that year without a doubt his best performance.The set locations are perfect for this film since all of the casino shots were taken inside of an actual Vegas casino. At the same time, the casino was convincingly reverted to the film's era, making us feel like we are in the early days of Vegas. It is definitely not the modern commercialized Las Vegas, but the older, frightening, yet classy Vegas where you don't try to rip off the casinos out of fear.Scorsese uses a lot of shots with an interesting light effect, where bright light is shone brightly onto one or more actors in the shot. This creates a surreal appearance and makes the person look superior or even godlike. He also pulls some very interesting camera angles and uses special effects sparingly.One of the things that Scorsese does really well is to explain everything the viewer without making it boring. Right at the beginning of the movie, he explains who everyone is and how the casino was started. Throughout the movie, characters engage in narration to reveal their thoughts where we might otherwise be left guessing. I think this adds a nice touch and we feel as though we are inside the character's head as they give the narration.Overall, this is one of my favorite films of all time and definitely one of my favorite Scorsese films. It is a true shame that he did not win an Academy Award for this achievement, since he clearly deserved it. I regard it as a must-see film, valuing it has one of the ten best movies ever made.

After discovering that her daughter is now dead, and being suspended from duty by her disbelieving company, she starts a new job as a power-loader&#151;a far cry from her esteemed position as the member of a flight crew.However, when the inhabitants of a terra-forming colony on LV-426 go missing, Ripley is offered her old job back (by slimy company man Burke, played by Paul Reiser), providing that she accompanies a bunch of space marines on their mission to discover what has happened.James Cameron, director of the fantastic The Terminator two years earlier, does away with the slow-burn terror of the original movie; after setting up the basic premise of his film, it becomes a non-stop thrill ride as Ripley and the heavily armed soldiers investigate the seemingly empty settlement only to find it is infested with tons of toothy terrors.After half of the marines are wiped out in a first encounter with the hostile ETs, and their 'drop-ship' crashes, Ripley and her team (plus a young girl named Newt who is found hiding in some air vents) try to stay alive long enough to figure a way out of their predicament.With its brilliant cast (including The Terminator's Michael Biehn as hero Hicks, Bill Paxton as coward Hudson, and Lance Henrickson as android Bishop), top notch special effects courtesy of industry legend Stan Winston, and Cameron's breath-taking handling of the action scenes, Aliens is solid entertainment from start to finish. Even the 'director's cut', which is extended by 17 minutes, breezes by without a dull moment.The finale, which sees Ripley protecting her surrogate daughter Newt by going head-to-head (using her power-loader, of course) with a giant alien queen is riveting stuff, and such is the overall quality of this movie I find it easy to ignore the occasional inconsistency (the acidic alien blood seems weaker in this film) or silly scene (such as Ripley successfully holding on to a ladder whilst being sucked out of an air lock with several tons of alien attached to her foot).Aliens is fantastic escapist fun and a worthy sequel to the brilliant original.

Even the 'director's cut', which is extended by 17 minutes, breezes by without a dull moment.The finale, which sees Ripley protecting her surrogate daughter Newt by going head-to-head (using her power-loader, of course) with a giant alien queen is riveting stuff, and such is the overall quality of this movie I find it easy to ignore the occasional inconsistency (the acidic alien blood seems weaker in this film) or silly scene (such as Ripley successfully holding on to a ladder whilst being sucked out of an air lock with several tons of alien attached to her foot).Aliens is fantastic escapist fun and a worthy sequel to the brilliant original.

Director Tim Burton, so far, has started and continued a promising career as a Hollywood filmmaker. So far, his first films I saw was Beetlejuice and Batman, both are well-done. Burton continued such masterpieces like the sequel Batman Returns, Edward Scissorhands and the highly acclaimed Ed Wood. Even his dark comedy Mars Attacks, which proved a little different from his other films, is still a great funny entertainment, which was a little better than the too-serious Independence Day. Besides, when it comes to Burton's different film, it can only be this, a remake of the classic adaptation of Pierre Boulle's classic Planet of the Apes.Just by looking at the results of this film, I'm sure that Burton was out of place here. No matter how brilliant he is as a director, the epic genre is something he's not in to. His films are usually the bizarre, or fairy tale-like films, combined with some dark comedy and satire. Planet of the Apes has none of those. It's a full-blood epic that revolves around man battling a more intelligent species that they weren't aware that will out-evolve them. In other words, the plot for Planet of the Apes is darn serious. Burton, most usually don't take everything seriously, and likes to look at the weird side. Since this film has no room for any of those, it's easy to see a failure. The make-up effects by Rick Baker are truly superb, giving each Ape character its own different look and personality. I guess that more than makes up for the films blander human characters, say Mark Wahlberg as a bland, often unconvincing action hero. Certainly, Tim Roth as the overreacting human-hating ape Thade, Helen Bonham Carter's human-loving ape Ari and many of the other simian co-stars steal the show, providing some terrific performances while under that heavy does of make-up. It ain't Burton at his definitive best, and PLANET OF THE APES certainly doesn't end being the summer's biggest blockbuster (even JURASSIC PARK III has more to offer than this).

Thirty years, and the movie is still as fresh, brilliant and scary as it was back in 1979, perhaps because no other film (with the exception of James Cameron's superb sequel, Aliens) has yet been able to match its claustrophobic mood and moments of sheer, unadulterated dread.Of course, by now everyone knows what the alien looks like, but when he inadvertently started the series Scott made the wise decision of keeping it mostly unseen the ghastly creature is almost never shown in its entirety, preferring to lurk in the shadows as the unaware human characters gradually realize what's happening. In fact, the first half-hour or so of the film is spent to introduce the protagonists and get a better understanding of their relationship, which, as in many other similarly themed movies, is tense. Justifiably, since the nine astronauts have been together on the Nostromo for a lot of time, sent on a mission in outer space by a mysterious Company. Suddenly, they receive a distress signal from a remote planet and decide to take a better look at what's going on. Within hours, they will regret it. Hopefully, the people watching this film won't.Some parts of the movie could be dismissed as clichés, but the truth is, of course, that Alien actually CREATED many of the stereotypes of recent sci-fi (crew being wiped out from within, no one out there to help them, et cetera). Plus, the film is so solid and consistently captivating it is hard to stop and think of possible leaks in the plot. As a pure exercise is suspense and horror, Alien has no rivals, Scott's clever use of lighting and camera angles ensuring the claustrophobia and tension never drop. He is also helped in this by choosing to keep the villainous creature in the dark most of the time, perfectly adhering to the old principle of the less you show, the better (something Spielberg and Carpenter applied with equal success on Jaws and Halloween). And while the characters may have been developed better in the sequels, what we have here is enough to qualify as convincing and likable, thanks mainly to a spot-on cast Sigourney Weaver, a complete unknown at the time, is mesmerizing in the role that made her an A-lister and finally put an end to the Hollywood tradition of women being no good other than when it comes to running and screaming. The supporting cast is every bit as strong, with John Hurt (who is the unsung hero of the entire franchise's most celebrated sequence) and Ian Holm in particular adding to the film's unsettling atmosphere.Briefly, one of the Top 10 greatest science-fiction\/horror (it fits equally well on either list) films ever, and, Blade Runner and Gladiator aside, the high point of Ridley Scott's career.

It would have been better to come at the story from one angle. then to come at it from all angels and confuse the audience as to what her intentions really were.

It's a delight and will take you back to a time full of styles so very different from those of today.(Note Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!

There is much talk of a negative first review on this site; I confess I didn't read it.Celia Johnson plays a married woman, Laura, who once a week goes into town to shop and see a movie; Trevor Howard is a married doctor, Alec, who helps a friend out one day at a week at a nearby clinic. The two meet while waiting for their trains, the assignations becoming more and more important to each, until they realize they've fallen in love. This is the 1940s in Britain, and there's no decision to be made.This is a very famous movie, and I can still remember the scene in Touch of Class as Glenda Jackson and George Segal cry over it. That's far from the only film in which Brief Encounter is referenced there's also 84 Charing Cross Road, Truly Madly Deeply, The Heidi Chronicles, The Care and Handling of Roses, The Mirror Has Two Faces, and many others. And with good reason. It's a tender love story about two good people who have probably never hurt anyone in their lives and find themselves in a precarious situation.The story begins at the end, before the audience realizes what is going on when a chattering friend of Laura's (Johnson) joins her and Dr. Alec Harvey (Howard) in the café. Just then Harvey's train is called and he rushes off. Laura looks stunned. Her narration begins, continuing on the train and once at home as she, in her mind, tells her husband the story of her relationship with Alex, how they met quite by chance. Then he went with her to the movies. Before long, she was meeting him on Thursdays outside the hospital. Laura is riddled with guilt and finds herself lying to her husband (Cyril Raymond). We don't get the impression that Harvey is feeling equally guilty; in fact, one gets the impression that he would do anything to be with Laura. However, in the end, he takes drastic measures not to be with her.Was the affair consummated or not? Nowadays, with email relationships going on, we know there's such a thing as emotional infidelity, and these two are definitely guilty of that. Physical? I have to agree that it's unclear. They have their special places - the bridge, the boathouse...it's up to the viewer. But Alec's decision certainly hints that something went on.Johnson and Howard weren't beautiful Hollywood stars, which lends realism to the film. They were both attractive, Johnson with her huge eyes and Howard with his chiseled features. (Johnson, by the way, was the sister-in-law of Ian Fleming, and her children purchased the rights to his books.) Laura's marriage is conveyed realistically as well - not unhappy, but not really exciting either. Yet she knows her husband is a good man. He gets the last line in the film, and it's one of its most beautiful moments. Perhaps they will come together as they once did and appreciate one another all the more.The film is scored with the music of Rachmaninoff - maybe it's a little too much at times, but at other times, it's achingly beautiful. The moment when Alec places his hand on Laura's shoulder as he leaves is one of the great moments in film, and a testament to the fact that love doesn't have to be shown using obvious sexual scenes, only with the use of some imagination.Despite Brief Encounter being dated today, it serves as a strong metaphor for post-war Britain. During the war, both men and women experienced more freedom from class and social restrictions than they ever had, but afterward, things returned to their conventional ways. It was a hard adjustment for many. Brief Encounter shows what happened to two people bound by the mores of the times.
