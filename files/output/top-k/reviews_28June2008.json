It does have in it a fine cast trying their level best(most of them at least) to make this crap they are working with work. Los Angelos is hit by catastrophic earthquakes and we see how several characters evolve and react...and sometimes die. We get the cop with the heart of gold and the gruff exterior(George Kennedy). The rich, cheating, talented, and strangely heroic architect that made the buildings that are collapsing(Charlton Heston). Ava Gardner plays his snobby, spoiled, difficult wife and Lorne Greene her father. Marjoe Gortner plays a reservist who takes his power too absolutely. Throw in Richard Roundtree as a motorcycle daredevil, beautiful Genevieve Bujold as Heston's love interest, and afro-toting Victoria Principal filling out a tee shirt better than anyone else in the film - and you have the major players of Earthquake. There is also Lloyd Nolan playing, what else, but a doctor of course. What separates Earthquake from many of the disaster films of its era is that at one moment it wants to be taken seriously and at another it uses some real stupid special effect or cheesy element or tries purposely to be funny. Walter Matthau plays a drunk throughout the film and let's be honest here- he just isn't funny. Nor is that whole bit amusing nor is much of anything else intentionally. There are some humorous scenes of unintentional humour. Watching Heston garble some of the lines he has to made me wince. Gardner looks so completely out of it. Kennedy gives a decent turn as the cop, but for me Lorne Greene did the best job as a man trying to save those that worked for him in a high rise. Director Mark Robson, a guy who started out making fine horror\/suspense films for Val Lewton in the 1940s, just doesn't seem to have his directorial fingers on the pulse for this film. The script meanders and the acting meanders with it. Add to this some very cheesy, less-than-convincing special effects and a poorly conceived ending and you get a bit of a disappointment in Earthquake.

Many have complained of the exploitation of such time-worn subject matter, but the worth of Kolya lies in the particulars of how its themes are developed. After all there are still good movies made about underdog sports teams prevailing, and even the exact same material (thinking Shakespeare here) can be made fresh through different productions.The man in question here is Frantisek Louka, the place is the Czech Republic, and the time is 1988 (just prior to the Velvet Revolution). Financial constraints tempt Louka to enter into a bargain to marry a Russian woman so she can get Czech citizenship and, it turns out, escape to West Germany to be with her lover. This leaves Louka to care for the child Kolya. One thing that makes this movie stand out is the quality of the acting by all involved. In particular Andrei Chalimon as the Russian child is very natural and will win your heart as he does Louka's. But it's a slow process.Another thing that sets this off is the political backdrop. I knew about Russia's occupation of the Czech Republic after World War II and the non-violent overthrow of the Communist government in 1989, but that is about as far as my knowledge went. This movie portrays what it was like to live in that environment in a concrete way that a history book cannot. A lot of little scenes exemplify the underlying tensions, such as Louka's being expected to display both the Czech and Russian flags in his window, Louka's mother refusing to let some Russian soldiers in to wash their hands by lying about her having no water, and Louka's purposeful refusal to learn the Russian language. So, this movie provided a small increment in my knowledge of Czech history and that's better than nothing. How the political situation drives the action makes for a singularly interesting story.The musical score that contains works by the Czech composers Dvořák, Suk, Fibich, and Smetana adds a special quality.Don't be turned away from seeing this because it touches on familiar themes; it is a quality film with unique characteristics.

Why must rampant lawlessness be fought with a system that is slower than slime? We know who the bad guys are; let's just take them out! That is what Inspector Harry Callahan believes in and that is what he does in the first film. Clint Eastwood's Harry Callahan and Charles Bronson's Paul Kersey from Death Wish serve as the models of vigilante justice, as people who reflect what even the most liberal among us secretly want, which is to see bad guys brought down. They are the men who enforce justice when the law fails to do so.What Magnum Force does is to show the other side of the coin, to show what happens when vigilante justice gets too dirty even by Dirty Harry's standards. The movie serves to add considerable depth to Harry Callahan. He hates the system but until someone comes along with changes that work, I'm sticking with it. From this movie, we see that Dirty Harry is not a fascist, but rather is a man with a strong moral compass who always does the right thing. He's willing to break the law to do the right thing, but he's never going to do the wrong thing. Even vigilantism has its limits and, in Magnum Force, Harry takes on those who have gone too far.The great thing about the Dirty Harry movies is not just that they're entertaining action movies but that they leave a lot of room for discussion. These are movies that raise questions about the link between the law and justice. The original Dirty Harry is a statement against a legal system perceived as excessively liberal, where protecting the rights of killers results in injustice to innocent victims. Magnum Force is a response to that philosophy and is a statement against an excessively right-wing legal system, where individual law enforcement officers become judge, jury, and executioner. In both cases, in steps Harry Callahan as the voice of morality and justice. Only with a lead character as strong as Dirty Harry can an action movie series debate itself this effectively.

Many complained of The Untouchables lack of historic accuracy, and even of its dissimilarity to the Robert Stack t.v. series. All I can say is thank goodness on both counts. De Palma's film is a work of fiction, a piece of entertainment in every sense of the word.The excellence is evident from the ground up, starting with the gorgeous costumes from the classy menswear outfit, Georgio Armani. Art Direction is out of this world (William A. Elliott), recreating Prohibition era Chicago with grand assuredness, using the actual streets and settings. All those model-T's look great. Cinematographer Stephen H. Burum has a field day capturing the lavish sets (Capone's hotel suite, the specially washed Chicago streets). His work, during sequences such as the Canadian border raid and the train station shoot out, is spectacular. Burum also cleverly makes use of the fantastic architecture in several scenes by filming from the ground looking up. This also makes the characters appear larger than life.Ennio Morricone's score is one of the best I've ever heard. The commanding Strength of the Righteous (Main Title) draws out the suspense dramatically, the Death Theme is tragically poignant, his Machine Gun Lullaby is a melodic work of genius and the End Title is one of the most rousing themes ever composed.Screenwriter David Mamet has provided an exciting story, varied (likeable and loathsome) characters, and he dresses it all with sharp, incisive, biting and all together entertaining dialogue. Grand and stylish acting brings Mamet's characters to life. Costner solidly portrays the beyond reproach law man who allows himself to become corruptible in order to do justice. Good too is Andy Garcia as the rookie prodigy Stone, who joins the team in pursuit of Capone. Out shining these two easily are Sean Connery as world weary Irish cop Malone, and Robert De Niro, mesmerising as the megalomaniacal gangster boss who has a special speech for all occasions. When words fail though, look out. Charles Martin Smith comes close to these two as Oscar Wallace, the rather enthusiastic accountant who sets up the case against Capone.De Palma shapes all the above into a film that is dramatic, tense, forceful, funny and tragic all at once. Coupled with this are the movie's numerous scenes of power, the train station and the gangster banquet being just two. Truly every scene has a measured impact, thanks to Mamet's amazing scripting. The Untouchables is a real victory for De Palma, Mamet, Connery, De Niro and a host of technical professionals.Monday, July 7, 1997 - Astor TheatreI know I always open by calling this film grand, but that's what it is.

Burum's classy cinematography and even Ennio Morricone's music (the best theme ever written for a movie), the whole picture is dripping with style.De Palma directs with a flair and purpose that he's never really shown before or since, while the perfect cast have a field day with David Mamet's razor sharp script. Costner is the epitome of incorruptible law, Andy Garcia and Charles Martin Smith great value as a sharp-shooter and a dedicated accountant respectively. It I s scene-chewers Sean Connery and Robert De Niro who put the icing on the cake though. Connery's world-weary Irish cop won him a deserved Oscar, while De Niro is at his chilling best bringing Al Capone to life.

Stanley Kubrick's satire of blow-hard politicians, insane military men, conspiracy theories and the strategy of MAD (mutual assured destruction) blasted a perceptive hole in the madness of the time. This film is unmistakably modern in its comedy and was a forebear to the ultra-ironic sense of humor that is the bread and butter of all the popular satire of this era. Of course, most young people (myself included) will have already seen many of the famous scenes in Dr. Strangelove replicated on The Simpsons long before they ever see the actual movie.The film's plot involves ardent anti-communist General Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden; ironically a one-time communist sympathizer) and his plan to destroy the USSR. Ripper's sexual inadequacies have led him to the conclusion that he is the victim of a communist conspiracy to sap and impurify all of our precious bodily fluids. His response is to order a sneak attack against the Russians, in the hope that President Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers) will subsequently be forced to finish the job.From here we see the desperate attempts to stop the attack (and the subsequent activation of the Russian doomsday device) in some of the greatest sequences of comedy in film history. Ridiculous and hilarious dialog abounds. Most of the characters in charge are shockingly petty and out of touch with the deadly reality of the situation. In addition to Sellers' three roles the most memorable performance comes from George C. Scott as General Buck Turgidson. He is jingoistic, incompetent and cannot refrain from insulting the Russian ambassador, even with the fate of the world on the line. You can't fight in here; this is the War Room! scolds the president.Thematically, two things stand out for me. The Kubrick theme of dehumanization is constantly present and Kubrick makes it very clear that humans are the problem. The technology they create does, for the most part, exactly what it is supposed to do, whether this means bombs that were designed to destroy the world doing just that, or Dr. Strangelove's Nazi-made mechanical arm acting like... a Nazi. Kubrick, at least in this film, has no inherent problem with technology, only with the very frail and flawed human beings that control it.Finally, to put it simply, human motivation in this film can be summed up as follows it's all about sex. Phallic images are pervasive from start to finish and most characters have sexually suggestive names. The men's faces light up ebulliently when Strangelove suggest that human beings may be able to survive beneath the earth in mine shafts and states that a suitable breeding population should include a female to male ratio of 101. I cannot shake the idea that that may have been their plan all along.Never before or since has such an audacious comedy been made. As far as the current geo-political situations go (Iraq et al), we have only seen a series of somber, often didactic dramas that have received mixed reviews and universally poor box office. Will someone have the courage to make another great intelligent political comedy, for our time? Given the much lower overall threat of total annihilation today, surely we deserve at least as much dark entertainment as audiences in the sixties received.

Herk Harvey, a man who principally made instructional films, set out to make this little horror thriller on a shoestring budget back in the early 1960s. The story is purposely ambiguous about a girl being thrown into a river in an automobile crash at the film's onset, then moving to Salt Lake, Utah, where she takes a job as an organist, and then she starts having visions of meeting these pasty-faced dead all around her - particularly at this Saltair Palace - an abandoned amusement park. There is virtually no budget here, the acting is very bland from everyone concerned and some of the performances are just downright bad(no acting ability whatsoever), and the dialog is just as bland and bad at times. What makes Carnival of Souls then a classic? Well, there are several things. While the budget does detract from those areas mentioned, it greatly adds to the atmosphere created in the film. The settings - particularly the abandoned Saltair Palace and its desolation are strong images, especially when the dead cavort about. Herk Harvey knows how to use a camera. The vision of faces in water are strong ones or someone being there that a moment ago was not. He gets his audience to jump at the right time. But most importantly is that Harvey made up these dead in a way that would be copied - whether intentionally or not - for many years after from the likes of Romero and many others. The make up and look of these dead is fantastic. Carnival of Souls was the first film that showed them in this manner. The music also adds with that weird organ music stridently playing throughout. Carnival of Souls has its slow moments and it again has some pretty bad performances and dialog. Candace Hilligoss plays Mary the lead and does do a decent enough job making us interested in her. Most of the other performers look like they were around and asked to work for next to nothing. This would normally be a recipe for disaster, but in Herk Harvey's hands Carnival of Souls becomes a masterpiece of mood with its haunting music, eerie location shots, crescendoing tension, and animated dead rising up and out all over the place in a most art-like fashion. The ending nicely caps off the film's mood and theme.

The settings - particularly the abandoned Saltair Palace and its desolation are strong images, especially when the dead cavort about. Herk Harvey knows how to use a camera. The vision of faces in water are strong ones or someone being there that a moment ago was not. He gets his audience to jump at the right time. But most importantly is that Harvey made up these dead in a way that would be copied - whether intentionally or not - for many years after from the likes of Romero and many others. The make up and look of these dead is fantastic. Carnival of Souls was the first film that showed them in this manner. The music also adds with that weird organ music stridently playing throughout. Carnival of Souls has its slow moments and it again has some pretty bad performances and dialog. Candace Hilligoss plays Mary the lead and does do a decent enough job making us interested in her. Most of the other performers look like they were around and asked to work for next to nothing. This would normally be a recipe for disaster, but in Herk Harvey's hands Carnival of Souls becomes a masterpiece of mood with its haunting music, eerie location shots, crescendoing tension, and animated dead rising up and out all over the place in a most art-like fashion.

Herk Harvey, a man who principally made instructional films, set out to make this little horror thriller on a shoestring budget back in the early 1960s. The story is purposely ambiguous about a girl being thrown into a river in an automobile crash at the film's onset, then moving to Salt Lake, Utah, where she takes a job as an organist, and then she starts having visions of meeting these pasty-faced dead all around her - particularly at this Saltair Palace - an abandoned amusement park.

The city is no better than it was before; prostitution, robbery, rape, homelessness, especially drugs are all on the rise thanks to OCP wanting to sell out its citizens to make ways for a novel city while the only one to do justice is Robocop with his partner Anne Lewis (Nancy Allen) at his side.The new villain in the film is Cain (Tom Noonan) who supplies the popular drug Nuke in the city where he's untouchable.

He even orders his goons to dissect a cop in one scene where audience members might be a little more comfortable with Clarence Bodericker (Kurtwood Smith) of the first movie since not only did he give classic punchlines but at the same time wasn't that much of a monster to look at (Ex.
