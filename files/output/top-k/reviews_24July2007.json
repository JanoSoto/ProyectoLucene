Or maybe what happens is that this movie gets the deserved attention, while others sadly do not have the same luck (such as The Rescuers, The Aristocats, The Fox and the Hound, The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh, Robin Hood and others). That is the worst aspect of this movie's success. So, as one can see, it's not all roses.Nevertheless, Beauty and the Beast is one of Disney's most original movies. To a point, it is every bit as creative and imaginative as Alice in Wonderland, except that it isn't as eccentric as that one.One thing that is very obvious from the beginning is that this is a french tale. It's quite easy to understand that because all the characters have french names. Plus, they often use french words such as Bonjour (which means Good morning in french). Lumière even uses the word «Sacré bleu» once. However, it's not very clear the exact place of our story. All we know is that it's somewhere in France.As much as I don't like all of the movie's characters, some of them are very charming. For example Lumière (the candelabra), Cogsworth (a clock), Mrs. Potts (a teapot), Chip (the cute little teacup), Belle, Maurice (Belle's father, who is also an inventor) and Philippe (the horse). It's funny that a horse is named Philippe (Philip in french) - LOL.Belle is one of Disney's most beautiful chicks, together with Jasmine, Ariel and the Blue Fairy. Belle is also classy, charming, carefree, nonconformist, conservative and nice. All of this makes her an interesting character and, above all, different from the rest of her village's population, who see her as a strange girl because she likes to read and also because she can't stand Gaston (unlike the rest of women) neither the idea of being his little wife. Belle is appropriately named like that (her name means beautiful in french).Gaston (who is considered the villain of the movie) is a character who's got no culture at all, being the epitome of pure strength and no brain (like Biff Tannen from Back to the Future). Gaston is a tall, muscled, vain, arrogant, snobbish and chauvinistic guy with a heart of stone.On the other hand, Gaston's follower and helper, Lefou, is more of a goofy guy than anything else, nearly like a comic relief. No wonder he is named Lefou (which means The Fool in french).Monsieur D'Arque is a strange man with a sinister appearance that makes him seem to come from a terror film. For some children, he might be a bit of a creepy character.My favorite character is Chip (he is the cutest of all, besides, his natural sweetness and innocence helps). However, Lumière and Belle come incredibly close to Chip when it comes to my favorite characters of this film.The soundtrack isn't entirely spectacular, but the romantic ballad Beauty and the Beast is beautiful. It has 2 versions. Angela Lansbury's version is good, but the original one by Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson is extraordinary.As for the cast, it is brand new comparing to older Disney films and most of them do well. Paige O'Hara and Angela Lansbury are among the best ones, but those who steal the show are Bradley Pierce as Chip and Jerry Orbach as Lumière. Jerry Orbach gives so much life and energy to Lumière, with such a convincing french accent.The best part of the whole film is the famous ballroom dance sequence, which is wonderful, brilliant and very artistic (the graphics also make it look incredibly close to a live-action ballroom).Generally speaking, this film has the main ingredients of an animated Disney movie great picture quality (good designs, backgrounds, sceneries and colors), very good animation, creativity, originality, some charming characters, some romance, adventure, darkness, suspense, classic humor and so on...The Prince (that is, the Beast as a human being) almost looks like Jean Michel Jarre with that long hair. That said, his change of heart during the movie is amazing. From a person who is spoiled, selfish, unkind and with an explosive temper, he becomes kind, gentle and even romantic.Although the sequence Human Again was originally gonna be included in the movie, it was removed in the final version. It was recovered for the DVD. Yet, the version I consider the true one is the one without the sequence Human Again, even if that one is not *officially* the movie's true version. But for me the true version is the one I know since 1991. It's the way I always knew it, so it makes perfect sense.

He plays an elderly Harlem pawnshop owner that mostly thru the use of flashbacks, we find out survived a concentration camp, but lost everyone he cared about. Going thru those horrors have made him bitter, angry, distant. His experiences do not give him empathy for the suffering of others, such as his customers. Instead he despises them. When he finally lets loose nearly 30 years of built up emotion, Steiger goes from fear, to compassion, to anger, to guilt and to rage so quickly and so seamlessly he should have won the Oscar for finale alone. Sidney Lumet directs brilliantly, from extended scenes in the pawnshop, to the gritty streets of New York, to the flashbacks of the incredible horrors of the holocaust. But aside from Steiger and Lumet, the rest of the film is a mess. Quincy Jones jazz score with upbeat tempo at downbeat times seems out of place, and in fact quite jarring at times. The rest of the cast give performances too over the top to mesh well with Steiger or the material, especially Jaime Sanchez as the pawnshop assistant. Geraldine Fitzgerald's character really provides nothing to the story. She exists just to show us just how out of touch with the rest of the human race the pawnbroker is. But we already get plenty of that from his interactions with his family, customers and assistant. The screenplay was good as a singular character study of this man, but some of the dialog was horrible. Apparently in 1965 New York everyone and anyone who spoke to an elderly man called him 'uncle'. And they keep saying it. Everyone who comes into the pawnshop or runs into him on the street calls him uncle. Nobody calls him man, dude, old timer, sir, mister. It gives you the feeling that the dialog was written by somebody trying to sound hip and up with the times but without any idea of how to do it, someone unfamiliar with the street slang of the day. But in the end I still recommend seeing it, especially if you are a fan of a great performance.

But his dead friend begins to haunt him, telling him he has to kill himself as he is a werewolf and will kill lots of people and that Jack will walk the earth as a living corpse until David is dead. David doesn't believe his friend till he turns into a werewolf and kills. He then has to decide what he is going to do live or die.Congratulations to John Landis for making such a scary film. It really scared the bejesus out of me and I haven't been scared for such a while.It is true what people say, the old ones are always the best and this film is no exception. I have grown tired with Hollywood churning out crappy remakes of classic horror films that were a success the first time round. I feel with the current outflow of horror films, they just follow the same predictable path and no-one gets scared because they know what to expect. I suppose it also has to do with the CGI, some of the films use it and the effects come across too slick and I don't think it is as convincing as the older films that didn't have this technology when they were making the films. Special mention should go to the special affects and makeup which were just incredible, particularly the scene when David Naughton (David Kessler) turns into a werewolf. It works so well and it is something I don't think we ever saw before in films. In past films, It would happen very quickly and the audience wouldn't see the transformation of the character into a wolf, this film showed more than hair appearing on the body and face, it showed his body changing fingers expanding, feet getting bigger and body getting longer. It is just amazing they were able to do that scene so well, considering they had to come up with ways to manipulate the camera so the transformation would work on the screen and didn't have CGI to fall back on. The scene that is very creepy is Griffin Dunne (Jack Goodman) popping up throughout the film, each time looking more and more like he is becoming the living dead, a corpse, no longer human in appearance.I Was very annoyed when David and Alex (Jenny Agutter) started a relationship and fell in love because I was hoping there would be a get out clause where David would turn back into a human and they would be together and the film would have a happy ending. I was really rooting for this but when David was killed by the police, I cursed John Landis for introducing this relationship and then having David die. Then I realised it was a horror film and there is never a happy ending in those.Nearly missed Rik Mayall in a small part as a chess player in The Slaughtered Lamb. Surprised to see him in the role as I am used to him in TV programmes where he is larger than life and not as understated as he is in the film.On the whole, a film that had me jumping out of my skin a lot and a story that was unpredictable which made me enjoy it more than the remakes that just make me feel bored.

It really scared the bejesus out of me and I haven't been scared for such a while.It is true what people say, the old ones are always the best and this film is no exception. I have grown tired with Hollywood churning out crappy remakes of classic horror films that were a success the first time round. I feel with the current outflow of horror films, they just follow the same predictable path and no-one gets scared because they know what to expect. I suppose it also has to do with the CGI, some of the films use it and the effects come across too slick and I don't think it is as convincing as the older films that didn't have this technology when they were making the films. Special mention should go to the special affects and makeup which were just incredible, particularly the scene when David Naughton (David Kessler) turns into a werewolf. It works so well and it is something I don't think we ever saw before in films. In past films, It would happen very quickly and the audience wouldn't see the transformation of the character into a wolf, this film showed more than hair appearing on the body and face, it showed his body changing fingers expanding, feet getting bigger and body getting longer. It is just amazing they were able to do that scene so well, considering they had to come up with ways to manipulate the camera so the transformation would work on the screen and didn't have CGI to fall back on. The scene that is very creepy is Griffin Dunne (Jack Goodman) popping up throughout the film, each time looking more and more like he is becoming the living dead, a corpse, no longer human in appearance.I Was very annoyed when David and Alex (Jenny Agutter) started a relationship and fell in love because I was hoping there would be a get out clause where David would turn back into a human and they would be together and the film would have a happy ending. I was really rooting for this but when David was killed by the police, I cursed John Landis for introducing this relationship and then having David die. Then I realised it was a horror film and there is never a happy ending in those.Nearly missed Rik Mayall in a small part as a chess player in The Slaughtered Lamb. Surprised to see him in the role as I am used to him in TV programmes where he is larger than life and not as understated as he is in the film.On the whole, a film that had me jumping out of my skin a lot and a story that was unpredictable which made me enjoy it more than the remakes that just make me feel bored.

Otis likes it, he likes it a lot & together they kill some more people &, erm well that's it really.Co-written, produced & directed by John McNaughton this is apparently a controversial film based on the life of Henry Lee Lucas, I'm not too sure why because I thought it was alright but nothing more. The script by McNaughton & Richard Fire is actually rather bland & ordinary in the sense that nothing really happens between the murders, it just portrays Henry & the people around him going about their normal boring everyday life. Now this sort of thing obviously excites some as Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer is a well regarded film although I was throughly bored. I didn't like the dialogue either, I mean Henry & Becky sitting down at the diner table for the first time & then just going into a senseless ramble about their difficult childhoods including how Becky's father raped her, yes that is the sort of thing you tell someone practically the first time you meet them. I didn't find the film disturbing or particularly effective & the only real emotion I felt was apathy, I watched it to the end & it was decent enough but I didn't think it was anything special at all.

The acting is alright with Michael Rooker standing out.Henry Portrait of a Serial Killer for me was nowhere near as disturbing or controversial as many make out, it's a largely dull film about three people living in an apartment & two of them just happen to occasionally kill people for fun, that's it really.

The house in the 1963 version was filmed at Ettington Park Hotel in England and its house that truly has a life of its own. And this house in the new one has that same feeling. So there was all the ingredients for a good film. But they missed by miles.

The blue Genie is, without a doubt, the most amusing, hilarious, imaginative and genial Genie ever created. Robin Williams steals the show as the Genie's voice. With his incredible talent to do voices, he's hilariously awesome and fantastic as the Genie's voice (and also as the voice of the enigmatic merchant that appears at the beginning, who happens to be an interesting character).Iago is the funniest character of this movie, along with the Genie. Nobody better than Gilbert Gottfried to voice the sarcastic parrot. Iago is simply hilarious! He's rude, grumpy, sarcastic, hungry for power, malicious, obnoxious and foul-tempered. He has an irritating voice but in a funny way, as well as a great talent to perfectly mimic other characters's voices. However, deep down inside he has a heart. I also love his hate for crackers. I don't see why does he hates crackers so much, but that also makes him so funny! Besides, a parrot with teeth?? lol!Jafar is a great villain. Although often calm and humorous (for example, he keeps calling Prince Abooboo to Prince Ali), he also represents the worst and most ambitious kind of villain and he is one of the most dangerous Disney villains. And he does possess a snake-like tone of voice sometimes.Princess Jasmine, what can I say? Have you ever seen a more beautiful Disney princess? She's just gorgeous! Despite her strong and challenging personality, I like her anyway.The Sultan is a funny dude. The Magic Carpet is lovable, one of my favorite characters from the movie. Aladdin himself is a nice guy, poor but kind-hearted (although dishonest, immature and selfish sometimes).Abu is funny mostly because of his vocal sounds, very Donald Duck-like. The Cave of Wonders is an amazing character. It is a giant tiger's head with an absolutely fantastic and brutal deep-throat voice.Aladdin is a festival of magic, special effects, bombastic humor and jokes.By the way, I absolutely love the song A Whole New World. The version sung by Aladdin and Jasmine is great, but the original version of Peabo Bryson and Regina Belle is better, deeper and more romantic and classic. It's a very romantic and joyful song, which is always a pleasure to listen. Arabian Nights is a nice song as well...I'd only wish that Aladdin hadn't become a victim of its own success. It inspired 2 sequels and several stories with these characters.This should definitely be on Top 250.

Since the work was directed by George Cukor, one expects fine performances, and the film delivers several of these; it is in fact unusually well-done in many respects in my judgment. The screenplay by John Van Druten, Walter Reisch and John Balderston has also been widely admired for retaining the theatrical tension of the original work. As produced by Arthur Hornblow Jr., this intelligent but somewhat unsettling drama features understated music by Bronislau Kaper, the fine cinematography of Joseph Ruttenberg, art direction by the great Cedric Gibbons, unusually good set decorations by Edwin B. Willis and costumes design by Irene (Sharaff). But because of the understatement of its scenes, the lack of large scenes of action and image, and the sheer amount of its meaningful dialog, it is an actor's film. The minor players such as Dame May Witty as the heroine's neighbor, Tom Stevenson as Wlliams the policeman, Angela Lansbury as the saucy aid, Barbar Everest as the faithful maid Elizabeth, Emil Rmeau as the maestro, Heather Thatcher as Lady Dalroy, Halliwell Hobbes and Edmund Breon and Lawrence Grossman range in ability from good to exceptional. As the policeman who discerns what is going on that troubles the heroine, played by Ingrid Bergman, Joseph Cotten is dashing, attractive and acceptable as both potential lover and man of action. Charles Boyer has in this film a thankless role, that of a devouring immoralist who has only two possible moods-- brief burst of anger needing to be controlled and an exuded charm that must be slightly overdone at times. These moods he plays very professionally at all points, his timing being not the least of his accomplishments during the film. In the difficult role of a Victorian young woman of intelligence, honesty and vulnerability, Oscar winner Ingrid Bergman earns the award by sustaining a sunny and intelligent personality undergoing a series of slowly-revealed and subtle attacks from her husband, who is trying to convince her she is incapable of independent function. Everything in the film--lighting, use of flights of stairs, objects, blocking, gestures, observers, character and dialog contribute to the overall effect. Even the title, referring to the mysterious changes in the lighting of the house Bergman and Boyer inhabit has meaning here. The film is not a sunny one; but the suspense is in my opinion rather admirably sustained. In tribute to its quality as a drama, I can only say that in the more than six decades since the film was created, no imitation of its male to female menace has come close to achieving anything really approaching its sterling qualities. To have ushered in a sub-genre--the Victorian menaced-female type, and set so high a mark is no small feat.

Actually a lot scenes and filming techniques closely resemble Halloween and even its first sequel, but the main difference it's headed by Norrissssssss. The far-fetched concept isn't bad with slasher tones, a lady in peril get-up and a mad scientist theme, but it throws so much in that there seems to be too much useless filler (like the corny romance sequences, biker trouble (nice work in the bar Chuck, but we already know how good you are), scientific moral dilemmas and non-effective comic humour) interrupting what could've been more fun. Silly it is to begin with, but do we want to see Norris romancing, or kicking ass? These redundant acts only slowed it up and got in the way on the main story. What outweighs the film is the weakly lacking script with many clumsy dialogues. Norris even gets time to share some heart-warming advice. Director Michael Millar starts off pretty slowly, but in the second half demonstrates well-shot camera placement and steady pockets of poignant tension. The atmospheric synthesizer score seemed to work. Chuck gets his hands dirty with some gusty scuffles involving the super-human killing machine, like the modest, if unspectacular showdown with him using his jump-kicks (in slow-motion of course) and sudden close-ups to show that focuses on his face. Norris' chimes in with a stoic performance, but goes gusty when the action calls. Brian Libby's menacingly towering figure is effective. Ron Silver sticks out as the humane doctor, while William Finley goes all-smarmy as deceitfully mad doctor looking for that Nobel Prize award. Stephen Furst as the overweight, downright clueless deputy was there for the laughs, but where were they. Toni Kalem looks all-sweet as Norris old flame.

What outweighs the film is the weakly lacking script with many clumsy dialogues. Norris even gets time to share some heart-warming advice. Director Michael Millar starts off pretty slowly, but in the second half demonstrates well-shot camera placement and steady pockets of poignant tension. The atmospheric synthesizer score seemed to work. Chuck gets his hands dirty with some gusty scuffles involving the super-human killing machine, like the modest, if unspectacular showdown with him using his jump-kicks (in slow-motion of course) and sudden close-ups to show that focuses on his face. Norris' chimes in with a stoic performance, but goes gusty when the action calls. Brian Libby's menacingly towering figure is effective. Ron Silver sticks out as the humane doctor, while William Finley goes all-smarmy as deceitfully mad doctor looking for that Nobel Prize award.

At the hospital, he's pronounced dead, but secretly he's used in an experiment by some surgeons working on a formula to help the body genetically heal in quick succession. They thought they could control him and this development would bring them success, but now this homicidal murderer is an unstoppable killing machine and Sheriff Stevens and his rookie Deputy are on the trail.Norris' fans might dig it, but others might find this cheap-jack b-film a boring chore. I thought it was fair. Anyhow who's the man, Chuck's the man. Not much of an actor though, but we know. He gets by with that golden blonde hair and legendary chop-suey who-ha&#133;. And not forgetting that distinguishable fuzz above the lip. The premise is like an over-extended episode of Walker, Texas Ranger meets John Carpenter's Halloween (1977). Actually a lot scenes and filming techniques closely resemble Halloween and even its first sequel, but the main difference it's headed by Norrissssssss.

The difference between Besson's films and standard action films is what Besson does with the rest of the story. His films feature intense character development and satisfying human plots. In both films, Besson's heroes are ruthless professional killers. Sympathy for Nikita develops because of her tragic struggle against her own history and psychology, while Leon's latent sense of justice, brought on by his innocent love for a 12 year old girl, makes this professional hit man truly heroic. Besson's action is over-the-top, wild and unrealistic, what makes his films so believable and so compelling is PSYCHOLOGICAL REALISM - a much more engaging aspect of film than violence will ever be. Quentin Tarantino could learn much through a close study of Besson (though I am sure he has already done this) Leon is played by Jean Reno. Reno is a charismatic, under-appreciated physical actor, and his performance is wonderful. Natalie Portman, in her early teens, gives an amazing performance as Mathilda the character around whom the entire story revolves. And Gary Oldman is masterful as the despicable Stansfield. Oldman has given us so many remarkable performances over the years, that it is difficult to identify his most profound parts, but this is certainly among his most memorable.Mathilda is a troubled young girl whose family - who she is not very fond of - is about to get wiped out over a drug dispute. Leon is a professional killer who lives down the hall. When Mathilda's family is wiped out, Leon - and you get the feeling that this is the first time he has allowed himself to feel sympathy is many years - takes her in. Thus begins the love story, and the story of revenge that will drive the film's major themes and its plot. The story is beautifully filmed and exquisitely paced - you will be unable to take your eyes from the screen. The soundtrack is also excellent and wholly unobtrusive. The action scenes are memorable, affective, and tastefully subordinate to the story (take note Quentin). Directing A+ Script A+ Acting A+ Story A+ Cinematography A+ Sound\/Music A+Very highly recommended.

There's wonderful food, chefs with personality, and a rat... wait, that's Ratatouille, Pixar's latest offering which unfortunately won't be shown here until the end of next month. On the other hand, a trailer for a romantic comedy seemed to have caught my eye. Also set in a kitchen, it stars Catherine Zeta Jones and Aaron Eckhart opposite each other as chefs who don't get along but ultimately fall in love, you know, the usual opposites attract formula, in No Reservations.But I was surprised that it was actually based on a German movie called Mostly Martha back in 2001, based on a pickup at the library, and reading through the synopsis, it just couldn't be more coincidental as that. Hollywood has been poaching remake rights to a host of movies in Asia, from horror like Shutter, to crime thrillers like Confession of Pain, to Korean romantic comedies like My Sassy Girl and the likes. And of course, remakes and adaptations of movies from the European continent too. I wonder how much more original stories can Tinseltown spin on its own, without resorting to cannibalizing from others.Written and directed by Sandra Nettelbeck, Mostly Martha is not your typical romantic comedy, contrary to what the Hollywood remake would suggest (from the trailers so far). The premise is of course similar. Martha Klein (Martina Gedeck) is the head chef for a restaurant, a to the book, no nonsense, proud chef at that. She has a rigid lifestyle, and finds herself so high strung that on her employer's advice, reluctantly checks herself in for therapy. Her niece Lina (Maxime Foerste) drops into her life one day, and both find it difficult to adapt to one another, with Lina at first glance being your typical stubborn, bratty child. And things become worse when Martha has to face up to competition in her own kitchen, with the arrival of Italian chef Mario (Sergio Castellitto), a man whose laissez-faire style just drives her nuts.If Hollywood were to take the script from here, it would make it a simple, expected romantic tangle between Martha and Mario, in which the trailer for No Reservations seem to suggest. But Mostly Martha is more than that. It's deeper, more subtle, has negligible snarky remarks passing off as comedy, and doesn't turn the kid into a precocious cutesy tot. It's steers towards powerful drama territory, with each scene beautifully shot, minimal dialogue which just catches your attention span, and subtle philosophical ideas tossed into the whole works. It examines the relationships between all characters in a very engaging manner, and doesn't neglect any of the main leads.What emerges is a classy movie, with interesting reminders on life and living life. I particularly liked how fine dining gets weaved into the narrative, be it the preparation, or the properties, or just to decorate the set. Don't watch this on an empty stomach, please! What I found true is its account that unlike food, there is no recipe to life which you can follow step by step to a T, based on fixed parameters which if followed accurately, will bring out that flavour in the end result. Life can't be run that way, and certainly there is no recipe or formula on how to lead a successful life, having success defined by one's values.My advise would be, given that Hollywood has adopted key scenes in its own release, and signs do seem to point No Reservations towards a true blue romantic comedy, if you'd like, watch the Hollywood version, but please comeback to the original source material, and you'll understand why Hollywood wanted to remake this, and for you to experience the actual, rich storyline that Mostly Martha (or its German title Bella Martha) is actually all about.
