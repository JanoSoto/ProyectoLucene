While the technique screams Araki, as does the casting of Kathleen Robertson, the narrative is so conventional that you find the combination hard to reconcile. I loved an earlier comment that Splendor is like a John Hughes remake of The Doom Generation; i.e. very conventional and without the sex and violence, with a three-way relationship (two males-one female), Johnathon Schaech, and Director Araki's absolutely amazing production and post-production skills-along with his less than dazzling scripting.Although Araki is paying homage to the great screwball comedies of the 1930's Topper, It Happened One Night, The Awful Truth, and Bringing Up Baby; the style and substance of Splendor is closer to Mike Nichols' The Graduate (not to mention an amusing parody of the Graduate's climatic wedding scene).Kathleen Robertson has the Rose McGowen part in this version of The Doom Generation and is generally well suited to the role. I have not decided yet if Robertson is in McGowen's class as an actress, or in the class of her fellow Canadians Mia Kirshner and Sarah Polley. Robertson was excellent in Maniac Mansion and Beverly Hills 90210, but these were similar roles that appear to mirror her own cool and detached personality. One thing that is clear is that she was a great choice for Ariki's trademark close-ups. Anyone perceptive enough to close the camera to face distance when shooting McGowen, Robertson, and most recently Michelle Trachtenberg has a eye for breathtakingly beautiful visuals.The premise does not really have enough substance to sustain a feature although it might work as a half-hour television sit-com (see Three's Company). When the premise becomes tired the story brings in a new character, Eric Mabious; and the film self-destructs, killing time until a decent ending sequence. A tip-off that a screen writer has limited life experience to draw from is having cast and crew occupations for the characters. Robertson's character is an aspiring actress and Mabious is directing her in a made-for-television drama. His character is so hopelessly one-dimensional and painfully pathetic that I was convinced that he had a sinister side (what was with those blue contact lenses) that would eventually manifest itself. But this does not happen, maybe Araki had something interesting in mind and abandoned it in re-write. Mabious becomes a non-factor (see totally irrelevancy) and his scenes were simply inserted as padding to get this thing up to feature length.The bottom line is that Araki fans will be a little disappointed with Splendor. It is very conventional, it isn't much of a story, and the good banter is limited (although Kelly MacDonald has fantastic dialogue in all her scenes) . But if your Araki appreciation is more for his directorial talents (casting, mise en scene details, camera movement and placement) and his post-production originality, you will find Splendor measures up very well to his prior work. The morning after scene early in the film simply blows away anything similar from any director.

Can we be certain he was talking about Texas Rangers? I wonder how much he was paid for that sound bite. The material was rated second worst behind the acting in this film. Anyone with a 4th grade reading skill could see this. I guess McDermott had someone else reading his work for him. While I would say that McDermott was the only one holding this film, he continually dropped it on more than one occasion. His character was decent, but not the greatest hero that I have seen emerge from the Mason-Dixon line. I think what hurts him the most was that he had to work next to James Van Der Beek, who never felt like a hero to me. I never really watched Dawson's Creek, but I have this feeling that he brought some of his character from the television show to the film. It was embarrassing to see him act, especially during his climactic ending that seemed more like amateur night at the local bar instead of acting.

I think that most were so excited to be working with their friends, that they forgot that this was an actual paying role and they would need to put some work into it. Even Rachael Leigh Cook was absurd. Her final speech in the film had me laughing hysterically, and it wasn't intended to be funny in the least bit. Miner completely miscast this entire film, and it is obvious from the revenue that nobody else was buying it either.With no support from the actors the story was sure to fall, and it did. There was nothing spectacular or original about the story. I have even read articles that state that the overall story behind this film was false and very fabricated. How can you take yourself seriously when you are trying to make a true story from fiction? Only Charlie Kaufmann could successfully do this and I did not see his name anywhere on the credits. This was a shoddy piece of workmanship that does not deserve to be called either a western or a adventure or a drama.

Mildred is sure that Bert didn't do it as he is far too mild mannered. She tells the police the story of their marriage where Bert left her alone with two children &#150; the tomboyish Kay and the materialistic Veda; how she started to work in a restaurant before eventually being able to open up her own place and making the money that she needed to give Veda everything she wants out of life.Despite knowing that it is one of Joan Crawford's better films I didn't know a great deal about it and decided to make good use of Christmas television by catching up on older films that I had never gotten round to seeing. The film starts many years into the main story, using a murder to trigger a flashback into a rather melodramatic story where Mildred's maternal instincts are directed towards the pursuit of money for her demanding daughter Veda.

A doctor identifies him and contacts Travis' brother, Walt, who makes the trip to collect his dead brother and bring him back home. Walt also brings bad news &#150; he has been raising Travis' son (Hunter) as his own since he was dumped on his doorstep by Travis' wife Jane &#150; who then just disappeared herself. Trying desperately to build a relationship with his son, Travis also decides to track down Jane and make his family whole again.Over the years this film seems to have grown in stature and reputation, partly because it is perhaps not as widely seen as it once was. For that reason I made sure I watched it when I got the chance recently and was struck immediately by one of the main reasons that I kept watching the film at times, that being the blend of beautiful visuals and haunting score. Normally films that have weak narrative will not suck me in but strong visual style (isn't that what the complaint about most summer blockbusters is?) however the striking look to the first parts of the film really drew me into it even when the plot did not. As everyone else in the world says, Ry Cooder's score was very well used and that's all I'll say on that issue since too many reviews seem to focus on this as if it were the most important part of the film.The plot is, lets be honest, very slowly delivered &#150; painfully slow at times; but yet it managed to fill almost 2½ hours quite easily and surprised me by how it suddenly became an impressive film when, for large sections of it, I felt left out, disinterested and distracted. Of course many younger viewers may not make it that far because it is very slow at times and this will put many off before it gets better. It does build well and it is really with the scenes between Travis and Jane that the film is at its strongest; I'm sure others have different interpretations but I do like to think that Travis was dead and only returned to reunite his family &#150; whether dead to them or really dead is another matter but the ending was nicely low key and lacking the sickly sentiment that could have killed it. The cast are a big reason this works because many of them do play really well. Stanton is great and he does tend to steal the film from those around him &#150; whether mute or unseen behind mirrored glass. He is excellent in his scenes with Kinski, who more than holds her own in a smaller role. Stockwell is good in support and Carson turns in a likable performance that pretty much manages to avoid cute kid destruction.Overall this is not a perfect film and many viewers coming to it on the back of its reputation may struggle to stay with a plot that develops very slowly indeed without a great deal of explanation. The acting is good, the score is very well used while the direction and cinematography is close to mesmerising at times. The script does deliver but I was never totally into it until the final third; fortunately at this point things become much clearer and much more interesting and, despite taking an age to get anywhere, I was ultimately glad that I had watched it and had enjoyed the total film more than I had enjoyed individual moments of it.

Without raising a laugh, it makes a mockery of what the film has been trying to do to that point and just looks entirely out of place.However, the stupid contraption aside, it's a really fun movie and a good way to waste a few hours in the name of entertainment.

There are moments where your heart will skip a beat. Such as when Melvin says to Carrol with more sincerity than Sting, you make me want to be a better man.Cuba Gooding Jr has a small role in this. Watch out for the very funny scene where he forces the dog on Melvin.

Both Nicholson and Hunt won Oscars for their roles and their interplay is breathtaking. I enjoy nothing better than to see two actors in exceptional roles working together, and as Good as it Gets is a perfect example. We see their excellent chemistry working throughout the film unlike in say, Silence of the lambs where Foster and Hopkins only had a few scenes together.Then we meet Melvin's gay neighbour, Simon Bishop who is hospitalised after he catches people breaking into his home.Simon's dog is sent to stay with Melvin and perhaps the most interesting relationship develops between the two.The rest of the film is the developing relationships between the characters and how they come to care for each other as well as us care for them.I will not spoil all the bizarre and touching events that take place in this film but rest assured there are many. There are moments where your heart will skip a beat. Such as when Melvin says to Carrol with more sincerity than Sting, you make me want to be a better man.Cuba Gooding Jr has a small role in this. Watch out for the very funny scene where he forces the dog on Melvin. There is also a small appearance by Yeardly Smith (the voice of Lisa Simpson).The one down point in this movie is that the romance novelist side of Melvin's character is never explored, which is unfortunate since you cannot add such a bizarre feature to a character like this and not explain it. The director could have taken an extra scene to convey this characteristic.Nonetheless, this is a film you can't not love. For each person there are different moments you will always remember and there is no one who will be left untouched.

The way this film tells it, she wouldn't have lasted a week without the help of Geoffrey Rush - he orchestrates her every victory.So it's not really a tale of female empowerment, is it? Granted, the movie isn't necessarily obliged to be feminist in its outlook. But I still find it disappointing on several levels. Elizabeth only becomes the formidable figure of history in the very last - and admittedly great - scene. So we never get to witness her oversee the defeat of the Spanish Armada, or commission Shakespeare to write the Merry Wives of Windsor, or anything like that. We merely get to see her order Rush to whack various spies, foreigners, and rivals. It's like an Elizabethan mobster movie - and it's clearly trying too hard to be sexy and violent to work.I wanted more boring stuff - more religion, more politics, and definitely more character development. The whole point of the movie is that Elizabeth rejects her suitors and becomes a self-governing virgin queen, but her suitors are such cardboard characters that her choice seems preordained.

Another thing that bugged me was how Alice's best friend Yvonne, was able to find Amanda's body via a staircase leading up to a sealed off room (like none of this would have looked suspicious to anyone working there at the time, or the authorities) its an extremely disappointing moment in the film & goes to show how much thought was put into the script. Also Amanda, was a much older woman in III, here she's a woman in her mid twenties\/early thirties & the small closed down wing of the hospital she was raped in many years ago (Seen in III) is now a huge, Gothic like structure of an abandon hospital! despite a somewhat intriguing idea for a plot, the film is poorly handled, with it's execution on screen coming off as laughable in parts. Alice's son Jacob also has quiet the vocabulary for a ten year old boy who is yet to be born & be around adults. But perhaps the most glaring plot contradiction of all, is how Freddy is shown here in a flashback as a baby, just recently born through Amanda in the hospital, but he's a monster! how is this possible since Freddy was born a normal looking kid, that grew up to be a child murderer that got torched to death by the parents of Springwood? I should note that this sequence was actually taken from an early unused draft of NIGHTMARE III. I also could also spot some three or four different editing mistakes throughout the film.

Made in Belfast, the ship travels to England before its maiden voyage, which it makes loaded with over 2,100 people ranging from the richest gentlemen in first class down to those in stowage seeking a new life in America. However, a series of errors and oversights result in the Titanic striking an iceberg and ripping a gash along the side below the water level. As the unsinkable ship starts to fill with water the shortcomings of having only 1200 lifeboat spaces sinks in.It has become very fashionable now to hate James Cameron's Titanic and it is the norm now, not only to prefer this film but to actively hate the 97 film in any review of other versions! I'm not a fan of the rather bloating modern film but I will refrain from making this review about that film and will focus on the one I've just seen. The first thing you notice here is how quickly the film moves and, after only a very brief introduction to the characters we are underway and hitting the ice. Shorn of romantic subplots and heart-tugging sweeping scores this is a very good approach and it simply lets the facts of the event and the real horror speak for themselves. In the remake we were supposed to get our emotional attachment to one or two characters based on their love for one another; here the film respects our humanity enough to know that we will be touched by the sheer number who died and the manner of their death. This works much better and it is genuinely eerie to see that large ship slip below the surface to a barrage of screams from unseen thousands &#150; that the effects are not as good doesn't matter because they are good enough and the emotional impact more than covers for them.This is not to say that the film lacks characters because you do tend to care for everyone and the film did very well in delivering little things without getting in the way of the rather documentary style form. The horror of the death is as well told as the horror of those watching it occur from the lifeboats; I liked the guilt of the designer and the guilt of the men who climbed into the lifeboats etc, these little touches work much better than inserting large fictional sections. With this sort of performance the actors do well &#150; all realistic with none really upstaging the film with ham. Moore is a good lead and only at the end is his delivery a bit flat &#150; but that is more the fault of a wordy conclusion.

The horror of the death is as well told as the horror of those watching it occur from the lifeboats; I liked the guilt of the designer and the guilt of the men who climbed into the lifeboats etc, these little touches work much better than inserting large fictional sections.

Seriously, if you're a true movie buff, an homage to movies should get an automatic spot in the top 250 or something. It is true that it would be easy to overlook the difficulties in a movie that's so lovable as Cinema Paradiso, but, although the film is wonderful in some respects, it maybe does not deserve the great praise we have heaped upon it.Cinema Paradiso focuses on a boy, Salvatore, who loves movies more than he loves his own life, which seems to be falling apart due to his father's absence and his mother's harshness. Salvatore also works as an altar boy, half-heartedly, though, because he always falls asleep on the job. Yet his friendship develops with Alfredo (played brilliantly by Philippe Noiret), who controls the film as it is displayed upon the screen in the tiny theater. Soon, Alfredo begins to teach Salvatore how to control the reels and the story develops further.The film does a great job of comparing the hopeful atmosphere brought on by film-watching to the hopelessness of a world without them. Both Salvatore's and Alfredo's characters do have a lot of depth, and it is a great joy to watch their characters develop. Also, Ennio and Andrea Morricone's music adds a great dramatic\/romantic feel to the film, while Tornatore's direction is also very good. The story and screenplay are brilliant too heart-breaking, involving, moving, and amusing all at once.However, two elements detract greatly from the film's resilience. One of these is the poor acting by young Salvatore (Salvatore Cascio). Although I have come not to expect much of anything from young actors, this performance just did more to make me think twice about seeing movies with much footage of children. The other element that takes something away from the film is the lack of focus during the first part of the film. I can understand that the action revolves around the movie theater, but the film at first seems to be a mere collage of scenes that take place at that location.Nevertheless, this film is very worth your time, because its highlights overshadow (for the most part) any difficulties. So, as you watch, be reminded of the magic of movies and their power to provide an escape, be it ever so temporary and imperfect.Final Grade B+.

WES CRAVEN has truly created one of the most terrifying villains of all time! A constantly giggling weirdo\/maniac, that mostly keeps himself confined to the darkest areas of a persons dream, thus making him look more like a moving shadow before he springs on his intended victim. The film cleverly plays it's themes on everyones childhood fears of falling asleep & never waking up, The nightmare sequences are very realistic looking & plays all the things that can & does happen in nightmares to a hilt, dark shadows, dead people visiting the living while still in bloody bags, a monster emerging from under bed sheets that bleed, popping out behind thin trees, wearing the faces of a corpses, unable to escape from a monster because you're feet are sinking in globs of wet plaster, the monster mutilating itself, attacking you, having it's face pulled off to reveal a hideous, grinning, laughing, skull. Trapped in a car with you're dead friends & being unable to escape while the creature kills a parent before you're very eyes. The acting is superb, especially for a 1980's slasher flick, most notably being RONEE BLAKELY as the alcoholic mother & JOHN SAXON as her loving father & chief of police. ROBERT ENGLUND plays the role of FREDDY KRUGER, with such relish, he makes him look, seem & feel terrifyingly real & HEATHER LANGENKAMP is perfection as Nancy, & who can forget JOHNNY DEPP'S excellent performance as her boyfriend who winds up eaten by his own bed! (Now I ask you what other movie out there can you see Johnny Depp eaten alive by his own bed?) What's most notable about the film compared to the sequels, is how the door on the house Nancy lives in is blue & in all the other sequels it's red & how Freddy's sleeves on his shirt are all red & the rest of the shirt is a dark red & green coloured stripes, this too would change starting with the next sequel. Using Freddy sparingly here, also helps make him more mysterious & extra creepy, we hardly see him until the end. Unlike the sequels that followed, Freddy is a dead serious maniac, he's not spouting jokes & one liners & bad puns & I felt that's what destroyed the series true potential & made the villain look even less scary. Craven's direction is perfection & his script is very well written & inventive, by having a villain attack you in you're dreams is an interesting plot twist, add to that & the fact that waking up does not necessarily save you, because he killer can follow you into you're world to finish the job he started & you have winner all around & it scares me to think that if Wes was taken away from his script & other writers & directors hired on, how A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET could so easily have become just another standard slasher film full of profanity, naked girls & stereotyped characters, with a by the numbers body count & paper thin plot, with no twists & turns, suspense, terror & tension, like virtually all the other horror films released to theatres when this film emerged. Unlike the sequels that followed that were made strictly for profit, you can see the heart & determination went into making the film & how well it holds up compared to other films of it's kind. Craven's trademarks are also prevalent in the film, the ordinary innocent characters thrust into a horrifying event as it unfolds, strong female characters, the hideous depictions of sadistic, deformed, realistically brutal ki ller, the villain who had brutally murdered an innocent child social issues, family breakdowns, the brutal graphic violence, the lead who uses booby traps to catch the maniac. The characters are interesting. At one point, Nancy even dreams of a death before it happens & tries to prevent it, when she wakes up. It really plays all the themes & things that can happen in a nightmare to a perfect hilt. Unlike he was in the films to follow, Freddy really does depict what a scary, nightmare maniac probably would do & act like if there was one in reality. One thing that always bugged me though, is how Nancy's boyfriend GLEN doesn't seemingly have nightmares even though, like the other three friends, he too lives on the same street & his parents also have a connection to Kruger's death. I always found that odd & I like the twist Wes has in the script where Nancy's mom has bars installed over all the windows & has the locks changed in attempt to protect her daughter, only for it to backfire with Nancy becoming a prisoner with the manic in the house, leaving her with no chance of an escape to try & save herself. The score is pretty creepy & there is the requisite amounts of bloody carnage on hand to help wet the appetite of gore hounds. Watch for a sequence that was re-used from Craven's earlier film DEADLY BLESSING where an evil lurks in the bathtub while a heroine is in it, but does not realize what is happening. Despite it's low budget qualities, the film has one nifty sequence where the badly burned remains of Nancy's mother falls into the spirit world that opens in her bed to swallow her up. The film only falters when it's let down by such a horrible ending that undermines what is otherwise a first rate shocker. A must see for any horror fan, in fact if you haven't seen the film, don't dare call yourself a horror fan until you have! Remade in 2010.

A car pulls up along side the now notorious 'Amityville House'. Two journalists named John Baxter (Tony Roberts) and Melanie (Candy Clarke) who work for 'Reveal Magazine' get out and enter the house. They are there to expose a psychic scam run by Harold Caswell (John Beal) and his wife Emma (Leora Dana) and write about them in the magazine. John and Melanie's plan of entrapment works and they get their story. The next day John and Melanie go back to the house to take some more photographs for the story. The house's current owner Clifford Sanders (John Harkins) turns up and denies any knowledge of what the Caswell's, the previous tenants were doing. Sanders tells John that he cannot sell the property because of the rumours and stigma attached to it. As John is currently going through a messy divorce with his wife Nancy (Tess Harper) he becomes interested in the property and agrees to buy it when he learns Sanders is, and I quote practically giving it away. Despite Sanders suddenly dropping dead for no real reason John moves in. At first everything seems fine, both he and daughter, Susan (Lori Loughlin) are pleased with the purchase. Things don't stay that way for long, however. Strange things start to happen, doors shut and lock by themselves, lights suddenly switch off for no apparent reason and two tragic 'accidents' happen that take the life of two people who recently had been in the house. John decides to enlist the help of his friend Dr. Elliot West (Robert Joy) who works for the institute of psychic research at the State University, Long Island. West and his team of assistants set lots of scientific equipment up in the house and wait. Eventually they find what they've been searching for, potentially with tragic and explosive consequences!Directed by Richard Fleischer I don't really have anything good to say about this film. The script by David Ambrose and William Wales is about as slow and dull as you could possibly imagine, and every single haunted house cliché is in here somewhere, I mean lights switching themselves on and off? Doors closing on their own? A tap running on it's own? Various 'spooky' noises that turn out to be nothing more than people walking around on creaking floorboards? One character having a very bad feeling about the place but no one else believing them? A innocent séance that turns nasty? Got the general idea yet? The film plods along at a extremely sedate pace until I was almost woken up by a car crash and someone being burned alive inside the wreck, but this sequence only lasts for a couple of minutes and in no way compensates for what has gone before or indeed after. There is a silly rubber monster at the end which is on screen for about half a minute, thanks a lot Fleischer. There is no blood or gore in it, again thanks for nothing Fleischer. There are a couple of unintentionally funny scenes though. At one point Baxter is in a lift that goes out of control. The G-Force on the way up pins him to the floor and on the way back down it pins him to the roof! A very stupid looking scene. As is the one where Sanders is attacked by flies, flies are just not scary or dangerous and all they do is just sort of land on him as Harkins tries to act like he's terrified and that's it, funny stuff. This film was originally shot in 3-D, there are a few scenes here and there which are obviously meant to incorporate this process and stick out like a sore thumb like the pipe through the car window, various things being supernaturally thrown towards the camera and the opening credits which look awful when played flat on an ordinary T.V. screen. It's certainly well made and the acting is OK, look out for Meg Ryan who has a small role as Lisa, one of Susan's friends. Boring, far too long, dull and there isn't a single original idea in the whole thing. I suggest you look elsewhere for some haunted house thrills and chills!

The pace never lets up, and the best touch is that the director uses brain action to drive the plot instead of violent action, which lets us identify with the characters. And what brilliantly constructed characters! First there's Dr. Richard Kimble(well played by Harrison ford), falsely accused of murdering his wife and on the run after a brutal bus wreck. We start to identify with him as well as root for him as he searches for his wife's killer. And then there's United States Marshall Sam Gerard(in Tommy Lee Jone's academy award winning role) who attempts to hunts Kimble down. The interesting thing about Gerard is that we begin to root for him too, seeing his tough,relentless character at work.There are moments in this film when Jone's is so unbelievable you heart skips a beat,yet Ford nor Jones take the spotlight. The lead is shared. In the few scenes they have together the interplay is near perfect. The murder and the conviction take place very quickly at the beginning allowing for the rest of the story to evolve over a longer time.This is well done, though it leaves us wondering why Kimble was sentenced to death on such circumstantial evidence. Hats off to the support cast! Joe pantoliano and Julianne Moore both turn in excellent performances. The one problem I have with this film is that the Dam scene is overrated. The previous scene in the tunnel was exceptional yet the stunt in question happened too fast and is undeserving of it's fame. The best scene in the film is when Kimble struggles to get through the electronic door at the prison as Gerard thunders after him. In say, James Bond films you hold your breath while the hero is in danger and let it go when he escapes. In this film you hold your breath for the full two hours until the final shot when you'll let it go. I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys films and if you haven't already seen it go to the video store and rent a copy of this definitive classic.

I'm not really into foreign films, but I find myself seeing more and more of them lately. The story starts as Lucía (Paz Vega) comes home to find her boyfriend, Lorenzo (Tristán Ulloa), missing and possibly dead, due to what seems like a suicide note left for her to find. From here, the movie goes back 6 years to show the one night stand on a beautiful moonlit beach with Elena (Najwa Nimri). They agree that it is best they do not even know each other's names but each have a few clues about the other. This is where the story really seems to begin.As Lucía, Paz Vega plays a memorable role as the infatuated\/somewhat stalker fan of Lorenzo, the writer of a book she feels is speaking to her personally. Even through the language barrier, I can practically understand Paz. I give credit to her acting skills- far better than Salma Hayek and just as beautiful, if not, more so. I can only hope she learns more English and can take more roles here in the U.S.The rest of the cast does a great job as well. Usually, I reserve judgment on the acting in a foreign film because it is hard to put the subtitles along with the faces, etc., but I can tell this one was acted very well. Along with Paz, credit is due to Tristán Ulloa and Elena Anaya (of Van Helsing fame here in the U.S.).I would give this movie a higher ranking, but I have to admit, I was a bit more than confused half the time and not able to differentiate the line between reality and fiction (in the movie). It is definitely going to take a second viewing to understand more thoroughly and, usually, those turn out to be the best stories. Another thing working against it, however, is the incredible coincidences needed to make this story what it is. I realize it is just a movie and a coincidence is very common in movies, but these were huge coincidences. Nothing to turn me off of the movie, but just something that nagged at me a little. See it to educate yourself on Paz Vega if nothing else, soon to be a much bigger star here. 7\/10 ","genre":null},{"date":"17 January 2005","score":"3 out of 11 people found the following review useful","review":" Sex and Lucía (or Lucía Y El Sexo) was an interesting, though confusing, story about a man, a one night stand on a beach 6 years ago, and his current girlfriend.

See it to educate yourself on Paz Vega if nothing else, soon to be a much bigger star here. 7\/10 ","genre":"Drama, Romance"},{"date":"17 January 2005","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" People come and go, and try and remake the classic film The Texas Chain Saw Massacre even though many remakes have come out, from different directors, and many do change a lot of the original film, but still have the the classic skin, chainsaw, the crooked dark house with lurking secrets, the heavy metal screen door where unthinkable things happen, and the scared but yet evil, cruel leather face who seems to be the boss, goes around killing but yet soft and scared when he has done wrong and is going to get punished.Even though Texas Chainsaw is over 30 years old, it still touches us as if it just came out for the first time even though its been brought out several times (Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2, 3, Next generation, also just made again in 2003) each time touches us in different ways but usually leaves the same thoughts, the buzzing chainsaw, the dark road towards the house with gleamy lights at the end, the bones and skin lampshades and chairs, the harsh grind of the large metal door when leather face takes away another one of his victims.When I watch this movie I always find myself feeling like I was there, almost like I can smell the rotting flesh, and feel the pain and terror of the poor souls in this movie.I always believe that no one can beat the original leather face (Gunnar Hanson) even though the original doesn't have much gore, and it doesn't have your typical graphics in this movie, not like most movies have now, and this movie was made on a low budget, but still has to be one of the greatest, if not the greatest horror movie in time.This movie is based off the killer, Ed Gein, who wasn't a chainsaw killer but did wear skin, specially womens skin and made every day things out of humans (lampshades, bowls, spoons, chairs) because he was one of, if not the only one, who made his mark in this world, who was deeply disturbed, and got taught that people outside his house hold was bad and devil like, and that he should never associate with women, so he grew up with no friends, never had a girlfriend or anything along them lines, but when his mum died, he turned two ways, one was he was glad because he wanted to associate with people, and killed women and raped them, but yet also killed people because he was brought up to believe everything was the devil outside of his house. So when his mum died, he tried to keep her alive by wearing womens skin, dressing up as her.This movie is probably the best because its based off a true story, and along the lines of what happened with Ed Gein ","genre":null},{"date":"17 January 2005","score":"1 out of 3 people found the following review useful","review":" People come and go, and try and remake the classic film The Texas Chain Saw Massacre even though many remakes have come out, from different directors, and many do change a lot of the original film, but still have the the classic skin, chainsaw, the crooked dark house with lurking secrets, the heavy metal screen door where unthinkable things happen, and the scared but yet evil, cruel leather face who seems to be the boss, goes around killing but yet soft and scared when he has done wrong and is going to get punished.Even though Texas Chainsaw is over 30 years old, it still touches us as if it just came out for the first time even though its been brought out several times (Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2, 3, Next generation, also just made again in 2003) each time touches us in different ways but usually leaves the same thoughts, the buzzing chainsaw, the dark road towards the house with gleamy lights at the end, the bones and skin lampshades and chairs, the harsh grind of the large metal door when leather face takes away another one of his victims.When I watch this movie I always find myself feeling like I was there, almost like I can smell the rotting flesh, and feel the pain and terror of the poor souls in this movie.I always believe that no one can beat the original leather face (Gunnar Hanson) even though the original doesn't have much gore, and it doesn't have your typical graphics in this movie, not like most movies have now, and this movie was made on a low budget, but still has to be one of the greatest, if not the greatest horror movie in time.This movie is based off the killer, Ed Gein, who wasn't a chainsaw killer but did wear skin, specially womens skin and made every day things out of humans (lampshades, bowls, spoons, chairs) because he was one of, if not the only one, who made his mark in this world, who was deeply disturbed, and got taught that people outside his house hold was bad and devil like, and that he should never associate with women, so he grew up with no friends, never had a girlfriend or anything along them lines, but when his mum died, he turned two ways, one was he was glad because he wanted to associate with people, and killed women and raped them, but yet also killed people because he was brought up to believe everything was the devil outside of his house.
